TI  - Application of active remote sensing in confirmation rights and identification of mortgage supply-demand subjects of rural land in Guangdong Province
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the remote sensing data plays an increasingly significant role in Land use prediction modeling. The effects of land conversion and agricultural bio production are evaluated using remote sensing and economic analysis. It is impossible to over-emphasize the advantages of the vibrant, efficient hybrid mortgage market in Guangdong as it is inseparably linked to economic development. This paper explores specifically the main variables affecting residential mortgage demand and other restrictions on households' use of a mortgage using the Fuzzy Systematic Evaluation System (FSES). Furthermore, this objective has been accomplished by examining and analyzing the available mortgage products in Guandong through questionnaire survey responses. In addition, the high-interest rates, low income, and house prices result in high and unreasonable repayment-to-earnings mortgages ratios. Moreover, the cumulative effect of this is to make households on low and mid-income prices to the mortgage market. While higher house prices are found in this study to increase mortgage demand, they trigger banks to offer fewer and charge higher rates, particularly after the boom, and especially for highly leveraged households.

TI  - Disciplining transnationality? The impact of study abroad educational experiences on Turkish returnee scholars' lives, careers and identity
T2  - RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the literature on transnationalism, this article explores overseas-trained Turkish scholars' experiences and whether these have had any effects on their identity construction/transformation, professional and personal lives after returning home. This exploration is informed by quantitative and qualitative data collected from Turkish scholars who completed their MA and/or PhD degrees in English-speaking countries and are now working in universities as academics. Besides highlighting the differences between educational values and practices in Turkey and Western countries, this article also examines how these differences influence professional trajectories and negotiations of identities among overseas-trained academics, with follow-up references to the author's autoethnography as a Western-trained scholar to spotlight the commonalities in the lived experiences of returnees. The results highlight the dynamic nature of overseas experiences and returning home with new competences, skills and a broadened worldview which results in returnees' distinguishing themselves from those around them in their personal and professional transactions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of trends in vegetation change across an artificial desert oasis, Northwest China, 1975-2010
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation change has become a worldwide environmental concern. Artificial desert oases in the Northwest China are among the most ecologically sensitive environments and are also a repository of ecosystem services by relying on vegetation system. Over the last four decades, land transformation related to anthropogenic activities and climate change is among the main drivers of changing vegetation cover in Northwest China. In an oasis where field-based research is challenging due to diverse landscape and heterogenous relief, quantifying changes in vegetation system using remote sensing can provide available information regarding trends in vegetation cover and its linkages with driving forces. This study aimed to explore spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation change through examining time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over the period 1975-2010 in an artificial desert oasis in Northwest China. A time series imagery derived from Landsat product was analyzed for the presence of trends in vegetation change. Using the nonparametric Sen's and Mann-Kendall methods, over 13.56% of oasis land surfaces were found to exhibit significant increasing trends, and almost 6.07% of oasis land surfaces were found to exhibit significant decreasing trends. The 80.38% spatial distribution of vegetation showed no change trends significantly. The relationships between the detected NDVI trends and land cover also were evaluated by using spatial mapping method. Results showed that the spatiotemporal pattern of vegetation change was consistent with the climate-related change of vegetation growing conditions and implementation of ecosystem management during the study period.

TI  - Improving aboveground biomass maps of tropical dry forests by integrating LiDAR, ALOS PALSAR, climate and field data
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Reliable information about the spatial distribution of aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests is fundamental for climate change mitigation and for maintaining carbon stocks. Recent AGB maps at continental and national scales have shown large uncertainties, particularly in tropical areas with high AGB values. Errors in AGB maps are linked to the quality of plot data used to calibrate remote sensing products, and the ability of radar data to map high AGB forest. Here we suggest an approach to improve the accuracy of AGB maps and test this approach with a case study of the tropical forests of the Yucatan peninsula, where the accuracy of AGB mapping is lower than other forest types in Mexico. To reduce the errors in field data, National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots were corrected to consider small trees. Temporal differences between NFI plots and imagery acquisition were addressed by considering biomass changes over time. To overcome issues related to saturation of radar backscatter, we incorporate radar texture metrics and climate data to improve the accuracy of AGB maps. Finally, we increased the number of sampling plots using biomass estimates derived from LiDAR data to assess if increasing sample size could improve the accuracy of AGB estimates. Results Correcting NFI plot data for both small trees and temporal differences between field and remotely sensed measurements reduced the relative error of biomass estimates by 12.2%. Using a machine learning algorithm, Random Forest, with corrected field plot data, backscatter and surface texture from the L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) installed on the on the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 (ALOS), and climatic water deficit data improved the accuracy of the maps obtained in this study as compared to previous studies (R-2 = 0.44 vs R-2 = 0.32). However, using sample plots derived from LiDAR data to increase sample size did not improve accuracy of AGB maps (R-2 = 0.26). Conclusions This study reveals that the suggested approach has the potential to improve AGB maps of tropical dry forests and shows predictors of AGB that should be considered in future studies. Our results highlight the importance of using ecological knowledge to correct errors associated with both the plot-level biomass estimates and the mismatch between field and remotely sensed data.

TI  - Analysing revolutionary Islamism: <i>Ansar al-Sharia</i> Tunisia according to Gramsci
T2  - JOURNAL OF NORTH AFRICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article offers a reading ofAnsar al-ShariaTunisia, a radical Salafist movement active in Tunisia between 2011 and 2013, as a revolutionary Islamist movement. Although referring to different theological sources, such radical movements end up reproducing the same model of radical Islamist politics traditionally associated to the Muslim Brotherhood (MB)-inspired movements. The article draws on a Gramscian Islamist framework of revolutionary politics first employed in Thomas Bukto's 2004 article 'Revelation or revolution: a Gramscian approach to the rise of Political Islam'. The objective of using such an analytical frame is to comprehend the revolutionary logic of radical Islamism. Although the Islamist/Salafi discourse is rooted in religious language and ideology, this article argues that it is no less revolutionary-minded, in the modern sense of the term, than the one of non-Islamist radical movements. Islamism is in fact able to provide the alternative worldview (ideology) necessary for revolutionary movements to oppose the dominant structure of power.

TI  - Verrucous sarcoidosis: a diagnosis to keep in mind
T2  - PAN AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Skin manifestations of sarcoidosis occur in up to 30% of cases, and may be the sentinel sign of the disease, with the skin being sometimes exclusively affected. While this may facilitate an early dermatologic diagnosis, heterogeneity in the cutaneous morphologies of sarcoidosis complicates recognition and affirms its reputation as a "great imitator". Here, we present a case of a verrucous version of sarcoidosis that may be misdiagnosed because it can mimic other inflammatory and neoplastic skin disorders. Although it is a rare variant, its presence should alert clinicians to the likelihood of systemic involvement of cutaneous sarcoidosis.

TI  - Usage ofMODIS NDVIto evaluate the effect of soil and water conservation measures on vegetation in Burkina Faso
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The dramatic droughts in West Africa from the 1960s to the 1990s compelled Burkina Faso to implement soil and water conservation (SWC) measures in the late 1970s. The purpose was to combat land degradation (e.g., desertification) in areas that experienced a decrease in vegetation productivity. In this study, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) trends from 2002 to 2016 were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test to explore the spatio-temporal variations of vegetation at SWC and non-SWC sites in selected regions of Burkina Faso. On average, NDVI increased by 3.6% annually from 2002 to 2016. Approximately 81% of the SWC sites experienced increasing (greening) trends, whereas 78% of the non-SWC sites showed negative (browning) trends. Typically, SWC measures in Burkina Faso, such aszai(traditional planting pits use to foster the retention of soil moisture and increase soil nutrients) and half-moons, are considered to have significant impacts on vegetation changes as visible from the NDVI. The results demonstrate that the implementation of SWC measures distinctly influences the vegetation growth in Burkina Faso. Thus, these findings could support regional and local informed decision-making in the context of sustainable land use planning and evaluation of ecosystem services.

TI  - Soil erosion and flood hazard zonation using morphometric and morphotectonic parameters in Upper Alaknanda river basin
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, detailed morphometric, morphotectonic, statistical and hazard analyses have been carried out in the Upper Alaknanda river basin (UAB) located in Central Himalayas, Garhwal, India. The study area is bounded by the South Tibetan Detachment System in the north and by the Main Central Thrust in the south. The major river flowing in the area is Alaknanda which is a major tributary of river Ganga. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of active tectonics, flood hazard, and soil erosion on the basis of morphotectonic and morphometric parameters using the Cartosat-1 Digital Elevation Model and ArcGIS software. The study area is divided into 10 sub-basins, where 50 morphometric and 6 morphotectonic parameters were calculated. Bifurcation ratio and stream frequency show that streams up to third order is having steep gradient and rolling through highly dichotomized terrain, due to which high overland flow and less groundwater recharge takes places, whereas drainage density clearly indicates the high flood possibility in the region. Morphotectonic parameters indicate relatively young to an early mature geological stage of sub-basins and tectonically active region. The statistical analysis of morphometric parameters is carried out by using correlation analysis, hierarchal cluster analysis, and principal component analysis. Based on their susceptibility to soil erosion, morphometry and landcover classification is carried out to prioritize the sub-basins of UAB. The combined morphometric, morphotectonic and statistical analysis indicates that the area is tectonically active and highly prone to flood, flood induced landslide and soil erosion. The case study of the 2013 flash flood event at three locations Benakuli, JP HEP and Pulna also confirms that the study area is hydro-geologically active to flood and flood induced hazards. The results obtained in this study are directly related to watershed management and hence soil erosion, tectonic activities and flash flood possibilities should be taken into consideration during future development in the area.

TI  - Upstaging nodal status in colorectal cancer using<i>ex vivo</i>fluorescence sentinel lymph node mapping: preliminary results
T2  - MINIMALLY INVASIVE THERAPY & ALLIED TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping using near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging is a recent technique to improve nodal staging in several tumors. The presence of colorectal cancer (CRC) micro-metastases has recently been defined as N1 disease and no longer as N1mi, determining the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. In CRC, the reported rate of SLN micro-metastases detected by ultrastaging techniques is as high as 30%. The aim of this prospective study is to report the preliminary results of the sensitivity analysis of NIRF imaging forex vivoSLN mapping and the research of micro-metastases in CRC, in patients with node-negative disease (NND). Material and methods On the specimen of 22 CRC patients, 1 mL of ICG (5 mg/mL) was injected submucosally around the tumor to identify SLNs. NND SLNs were further investigated with ultrastaging techniques. Results Three-hundred and sixty-three lymph nodes were retrieved (59 SLNs; mean per case: 2.7). The detection, sensitivity and false-negative rate were 100%, 100% and 0% respectively. Ultrastaging investigations showed no micro-metastases in the NND SLNs. Conclusions Theex vivoSLN fluorescence-based detection in CRC was confirmed to be easy to perform and reliable. In this preliminary results report of an ongoing study, the SLN assay was congruent with the nodal status, as confirmed by histological investigations.

TI  - Urban sprawl and its impact on sustainable urban development: a combination of remote sensing and social media data
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is one of the most impactful human activities across the world today affecting the quality of urban life and its sustainable development. Urbanization in Africa is occurring at an unprecedented rate and it threatens the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Urban sprawl has resulted in unsustainable urban development patterns from social, environmental, and economic perspectives. This study is among the first examples of research in Africa to combine remote sensing data with social media data to determine urban sprawl from 2011 to 2017 in Morogoro urban municipality, Tanzania. Random Forest (RF) method was applied to accomplish imagery classification and location-based social media (Twitter usage) data were obtained through a Twitter Application Programming Interface (API). Morogoro urban municipality was classified into built-up, vegetation, agriculture, and water land cover classes while the classification results were validated by the generation of 480 random points. Using the Kernel function, the study measured the location of Twitter users within a 1 km buffer from the center of the city. The results indicate that, expansion of the city (built-up land use), which is primarily driven by population expansion, has negative impacts on ecosystem services because pristine grasslands and forests which provide essential ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and support for biodiversity have been replaced by built-up land cover. In addition, social media usage data suggest that there is the concentration of Twitter usage within the city center while Twitter usage declines away from the city center with significant spatial and numerical increase in Twitter usage in the study area. The outcome of the study suggests that the combination of remote sensing, social sensing, and population data were useful as a proxy/inference for interpreting urban sprawl and status of access to urban services and infrastructure in Morogoro, and Africa city where data for urban planning is often unavailable, inaccurate, or stale.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel concept of an intraoperative gamma probe was simulated using GATE opensource software for the purpose of detecting and identifying sentinel lymph nodes during sentinel lymph node mapping. The probe is made of a pixelated Bismuth Germanium Oxide scintillator, BGO, which will be coupled to a Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) to collect the scintillation light. The probe detector has 9 pixels, each pixel is 3 x 3 mm(2), for a total detection active area of 81 mm(2). The detector height is 5 mm long. The probe detector was able to identify small sentinel lymph nodes with a 4 mm diameter. Sentinel nodes were placed at 6 different heights away from the detector surface starting at 2 mm up to 12 mm with 2 mm increments at each height. The pixel with the node directly above, node center is at the same axis as the pixel center, had consistently registered greater number of counts compared to neighboring pixels. Moving the sentinel node over all detector pixels produced similar results, where the pixel with the source directly above produced greater counts. Each pixel on the detector surface has a 2 pi steradian solid angle, so collectively the detector has the same solid angel, but as wide as the detector whole area. Depending on the shielding used around the probe head, the solid angle can be minimized or maximized to investigate a specific area during the mapping process of lymph nodes.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of deforestation in the Chapare region of Bolivia using LANDSAT images
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to quantify (a) spatiotemporal deforestation patterns, and (b) the relationships between changes in the main land-cover types in the Chapare region of Bolivia. We applied subspace classification methods to LANDSAT data from 1986, 1999, and 2018 and used grid cells at scales of 150, 300, 600, and 900 m to measure deforestation trajectories. The 150 m grids provided better detail to determine deforestation trajectories than coarser-scale grid cells. Differences in grid-cell scale did not influence the statistical trends in land-cover changes significantly. Changes in forest area were negatively correlated with changes in cropland (r= -.44), grassland (r= -.34), swamp grassland (r= -.38), and regrowth (r= -.32) areas. Correlations between forest losses in cropland, grassland, and regrowth change analyses were weaker between 1999 and 2018 compared to 1986 to 1999. Forest cover declined from 6,635 km(2)(1986) to 3,800 km(2)(2018), and the deforestation rate increased from an annual average of 1.36% between 1986 and 1999 to 2.0% between 1999 and 2018. The key proximate drivers of forest clearance rates and patterns were increasing population, agricultural expansion, and road building. While coca is an economically important crop in Chapare, its direct and indirect effects on deforestation could not be determined unambiguously. It is probable that the expansion of agriculture will lead to further deforestation and forest fragmentation and, along with decreases in forest cover, further changes will take place between non-forest categories.

TI  - Significant impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on urban air pollution in Kolkata (India) and amelioration of environmental health
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The fatal novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic disease smashes the normal tempo of global socio-economic and cultural livelihood. Most of the countries impose a lockdown system with social distancing measures to arrest the rapid transmission of this virus into the human body. The objective of this study is to examine the status of air quality during and pre-COVID-19 lockdown and to recommend some long-term sustainable environmental management plan. The pollution data like PM10, PM2.5, O-3, SO2, NO(2)and CO have been obtained from State Pollution Control Board under Govt. of West Bengal. Similarly, various land surface temperature (LST) maps have been prepared using LANDSAT-8 OLI and LANDSAT-7 ETM + images of USGS. The maps of NO(2)and aerosol concentration over Indian subcontinent have been taken from ESA and NASA. The digital thematic maps and diagrams have been depicted by Grapher 13 and Arc GIS 10.3 platforms. The result shows that the pollutants like CO, NO(2)and SO(2)are significantly decreased, while the average level of O(3)has been slightly increased in 2020 during the lockdown due to close-down of all industrial and transport activities. Meanwhile, around 17.5% was the mean reduction of PM(10)and PM(2.5)during lockdown compared with previous years owing to complete stop of vehicles movement, burning of biomass and dust particles from the construction works. This study recommends some air pollution-tolerant plant species (in urban vacant spaces and roof tops) for long-term cohabitation among environment, society and development.

TI  - Dictionary learning for clustering on hyperspectral images
T2  - SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dictionary learning and sparse coding have been widely studied as mechanisms for unsupervised feature learning. Unsupervised learning could bring enormous benefit to the processing of hyperspectral images and to other remote sensing data analysis because labelled data are often scarce in this field. We propose a method for clustering the pixels of hyperspectral images using sparse coefficients computed from a representative dictionary as features. We show empirically that the proposed method works more effectively than clustering on the original pixels. We also demonstrate that our approach, in certain circumstances, outperforms the clustering results of features extracted using principal component analysis and non-negative matrix factorisation. Furthermore, our method is suitable for applications in repetitively clustering an ever-growing amount of high-dimensional data, which is the case when working with hyperspectral satellite imagery.

TI  - SO<sub>2</sub> and HCHO over the major cities of Kazakhstan from 2005 to 2016: influence of political, economic and industrial changes
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) for tropospheric sulfur dioxide (SO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO) column mass densities (CMD) are analyzed for the period 2005-2016 over the atmosphere of Kazakhstan. Regarding SO2 the major hot spots relate to regions with high population and large industrial facilities. Such an example is the city of Ekibastuz that hosts the biggest thermal power plants in the country and exhibits the higher SO2 CMD at national level. The annual average CMD in Ekibastuz reaches 2.5x10(-5) kg/m(2), whereas for the rest of the country respective values are 6 times lower. Other hotspots, mostly urban conglomerates such as Almaty and Nur-Sultan, experience high CMDs of SO2 in particular years, such as 2008. One of the main reasons for this behavior is the financial crisis of 2008, forcing the application of alternate heating sources based on cheap low-quality coal. Regarding HCHO, an oxygenated Volatile Organic Compound (VOC), the main hot spot is noticed over the city Atyrau, the oil capital of the country where two massive oil fields are located. The highest HCHO CMD (9x10(15) molecules/cm(2)) appears in the summertime due to secondary production as a result of the photo-oxidation of VOCs emitted by industrial sectors, oil refinery plants and vehicles. Strongly elevated HCHO amounts are also observed in Nur-Sultan in 2012 that could be due to the residential coal combustion and vehicle exhaust under poor winter dispersion conditions. Significant reductions in HCHO observed between 2012 and 2015 can be attributed to two significant measures implemented in the country in 2013 that aimed at the improvement of air quality: the introduction of the emission trading system (ETS) for greenhouse gases and Euro-4 standards for new vehicles entering the national vehicle fleet.

TI  - Surgical Approach to Lymphedema Reduction
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of ReviewFor patients who have or may develop lymphedema due to oncologic resection, surgical options are available to prevent and treat this chronic disease. Here, we review the current pathophysiology, classification systems, surgical preventive techniques, and treatment options for lymphedema reduction.Recent FindingsPreventive surgical techniques, including de-escalation of axillary surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), axillary reverse mapping (ARM), and lymphedema microsurgical preventive healing approach (LYMPHA), have been shown to reduce the incidence of lymphedema. Water displacement remains the gold standard for measuring limb volume and classification of lymphedema; however, lymphoscintigraphy and ICG lymphography are two novel imaging techniques that are now utilized to characterize lymphedema and guide management. Complete decongestive therapy (CDT) remains the mainstay of treatment. Vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) and lymphovenous bypass have shown promising results, particularly in advanced lymphedema stages. Combination therapy, incorporating both surgical and non-surgical approaches to lymphedema, yields best patient outcomes.SummaryLymphedema is a chronic disease wherein management requires a combination of surgical and conservative treatments. Standardization in lymphedema staging, key outcome indicators, and quantitative data will be critical to establish the absolute best practices in lymphedema diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Combining Wire Localization of Clipped Nodes with Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Node-Positive Breast Cancer: Preliminary Results from a Prospective Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The ideal technique for lymph node staging for patients with pathologically confirmed node-positive breast cancer at diagnosis and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is unclear. Objective The aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility of wire/clip localization and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for the axillary staging of these patients.Methods. We conducted a prospective study in which lymph node staging was performed using wire localization of positive lymph nodes and an SLNB with dual tracer. All patients who presented no metastatic involvement of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) or clip/wire-marked lymph node were spared an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The multidisciplinary committee agreed on axillary treatment for patients with lymph node involvement.Results. Forty-two patients met the inclusion criteria. We identified and extirpated the clip/wire-marked node in all patients (100%), with SLNB performed successfully in 95.3% of patients. The SLN and wire-marked node matched in 80% of patients; 73.8% of patients did not undergo ALND. Discussion andConclusions. Several studies have evaluated the efficacy of various procedures for lymph node marking for women with prechemotherapy lymph node involvement. Most of the studies reported high identification rates (> 94.8%), with false negative rates of < 7%. Similarly, our study allows us to conclude that combined axillary marking (clip and SLNB) in patients with metastatic lymph node at diagnosis and NAC offers a high identification rate (100%) and a high correlation between the wire-marked lymph node and the SLN (80%). This procedure has enabled the suppression of ALND for a significant number of patients (73%).

TI  - A palynological perspective on the impacts of European contact: Historic deforestation, ranching and agriculture surrounding the Cuchumatanes Highlands, Guatemala
T2  - VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Spanish conquest of the Cuchumatanes Highlands (1524-1541ce) led to dramatic land use changes adhering to colonial practices and values, which included the rearing of livestock, agriculture, timber extraction, mining, and the relocation of indigenous populations to new settlements. These changes are often recorded in historical accounts and official records; however, these are sparse, incomplete, and have been lost over the passage of time. Here, we present a high-resolution palaeoenvironmental reconstruction for Cenote Kail (Guatemala) since the Spanish Conquest, to provide additional evidence of land use changes from an integrated multi-proxy perspective. We analysed: (i) fossil pollen; (ii) macroscopic and microscopic charcoal; and (iii) dung fungal spores (Sporormiella) from a lake sediment core extracted from Cenote Kail in the Cuchumatanes highlands, combining these analyses with remotely sensed satellite data. We reconstructed: (i) forest composition and dynamics; (ii) burning, (iii) fauna abundance, and (iv) agricultural activities. High resolution age-depth modelling was conducted using a combination of(210)Pb and(14)C dates. The high temporal resolution enabled a novel integrated validation of the charcoal data sets with remotely sensed satellite data and the historical record. Three stages of floral compositional change were discerned from the palynological assemblage data encompassing: (i) the decline of mixed hard wood forests (MHWF), associated with the building of new settlements, agriculture and timber extraction for fuel (1550-1675ce); (ii) pastoral expansions involving the rearing of livestock (1700-1800ce); and (iii) the expansions of urban settlements and increasing management of the land (1821-2015ce). Seed predation is suggested as the dominant factor preventing MHWF from re-establishing in the Cuchumatanes Highlands over the past 500 years. Burning is limited locally and regionally and in line with the modern regime, which suggests that fire has been managed and controlled since European contact.

TI  - Environmental monitoring and prediction of land use and land cover spatio-temporal changes: a case study from El-Omayed Biosphere Reserve, Egypt
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Environmental monitoring, using the techniques of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS), allows the production of time efficient, cost-effective, and reliable surveillance and tracking data. Anthropogenic activities appear to be the major trigger of environmental changes, including land use and land cover (LULC) changes, while natural causes have only a minor impact in most cases. The Omayed Biosphere Reserve (OBR) stands as one of the Egyptian protected areas most highly affected by massive unplanned human activities. Thus, the main objective of this study is to determine the spatio-temporal changes in the OBR over a 35-year period using five Landsat (5 ETM images and 8 OLI-TIRS) imageries, with the specific aim of measuring change rates, trends, and magnitudes of LULC changes between 1984 and 2019 with the topography for planning and selection of developmental strategies. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index is used to identify the vegetation characteristics of different eco-regions and delivers useful information for the study of vegetation health and density. Normalised Difference Built-up Index can likewise be used to quote built-up areas. Unsupervised classification was used to classify LULC patterns. Six classes were recognised: water bodies, coastal sand, urban areas, cultivated land, newly reclaimed areas, and bare soil. Our results reveal that about 33.55% of OBR land cover has transformed into other forms. Cultivated land and urban regions increased by about 143.5 km(2)and 56.17 km(2)from 1984 to 2019, respectively. Meanwhile, bare soil decreased to around 209.5 km(2)in 2019. In conclusion, the conversion of bare soil into urban land and cultivated areas is the major change in the last 35 years in the OBR. Over the past three decades, the OBR has faced radical and imbalanced changes in its natural habitats. Therefore, monitoring and management of LULC changes are crucial for creating links between policy decisions, regulatory actions, and following LULC activities in the future, especially as many potential risks still exist in the remaining regions of the OBR.

TI  - Satellite passive microwave sea-ice concentration data set inter-comparison for Arctic summer conditions
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on results of a systematic inter-comparison of 10 global sea-ice concentration (SIC) data products at 12.5 to 50.0 km grid resolution from satellite passive microwave (PMW) observations for the Arctic during summer. The products are compared against SIC and net ice surface fraction (ISF) - SIC minus the per-grid-cell melt pond fraction (MPF) on sea ice - as derived from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations and observed from ice-going vessels. Like in Kern et al. (2019), we group the 10 products based on the concept of the SIC retrieval used. Group I consists of products of the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) and European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) algorithms. Group II consists of products derived with the Comiso bootstrap algorithm and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) SIC climate data record (CDR). Group III consists of Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Team (NT) algorithm products, and group IV consists of products of the enhanced NASA Team algorithm (NT2). We find widespread positive and negative differences between PMW and MODIS SIC with magnitudes frequently reaching up to 20 %-25 % for groups I and III and up to 30 %-35 % for groups II and IV. On a pan-Arctic scale these differences may cancel out: Arctic average SIC from group I products agrees with MODIS within 2 %-5 % accuracy during the entire melt period from May through September. Group II and IV products overestimate MODIS Arctic average SIC by 5 %-10 %. Out of group III, ASI is similar to group I products while NT SIC underestimates MODIS Arctic average SIC by 5 %-10 %. These differences, when translated into the impact computing Arctic sea-ice area (SIA), match well with the differences in SIA between the four groups reported for the summer months by Kern et al. (2019). MODIS ISF is systematically overestimated by all products; NT provides the smallest overestimations (up to 25 %) and group II and IV products the largest overestimations (up to 45 %). The spatial distribution of the observed overestimation of MODIS ISF agrees reasonably well with the spatial distribution of the MODIS MPF and we find a robust linear relationship between PMW SIC and MODIS ISF for group I and III products during peak melt, i.e. July and August. We discuss different cases taking into account the expected influence of ice surface properties other than melt ponds, i.e. wet snow and coarse-grained snow/refrozen surface, on brightness temperatures and their ratios used as input to the SIC retrieval algorithms. Based on this discussion we identify the mismatch between the actually observed surface properties and those represented by the ice tie points as the most likely reason for (i) the observed differences between PMW SIC and MODIS ISF and for (ii) the often surprisingly small difference between PMW and MODIS SIC in areas of high melt pond fraction. We conclude that all 10 SIC products are highly inaccurate during summer melt. We hypothesize that the unknown number of melt pond signatures likely included in the ice tie points plays an important role - particularly for groups I and II - and recommend conducting further research in this field.

TI  - Living with floating vegetation invasions
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasions of water bodies by floating vegetation, including water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), are a huge global problem for fisheries, hydropower generation, and transportation. We analyzed floating plant coverage on 20 reservoirs across the world's tropics and subtropics, using > 30 year time-series of LANDSAT remote-sensing imagery. Despite decades of costly weed control, floating invasion severity is increasing. Floating plant coverage correlates with expanding urban land cover in catchments, implicating urban nutrient sources as plausible drivers. Floating vegetation invasions have undeniable societal costs, but also provide benefits. Water hyacinths efficiently absorb nutrients from eutrophic waters, mitigating nutrient pollution problems. When washed up on shores, plants may become compost, increasing soil fertility. The biomass is increasingly used as a renewable biofuel. We propose a more nuanced perspective on these invasions moving away from futile eradication attempts towards an ecosystem management strategy that minimizes negative impacts while integrating potential social and environmental benefits.

TI  - Land cover harmonization using Latent Dirichlet Allocation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-area land cover maps are produced to satisfy different information needs. Land cover maps having partial or complete spatial and/or temporal overlap, different legends, and varying accuracies for similar classes, are increasingly common. To address these concerns and combine two 30-m resolution land cover products, we implemented a harmonization procedure using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. The LDA model used regionalized class co-occurrences from multiple maps to generate a harmonized class label for each pixel by statistically characterizing land attributes from the class co-occurrences. We evaluated multiple harmonization approaches: using the LDA model alone and in combination with more commonly used information sources for harmonization (i.e. error matrices and semantic affinity scores). The results were compared with the benchmark maps generated using simple legend crosswalks and showed that using LDA outputs with error matrices performed better and increased harmonized map overall accuracy by 6-19% for areas of disagreement between the source maps. Our results revealed the importance of error matrices to harmonization, since excluding error matrices reduced overall accuracy by 4-20%. The LDA-based harmonization approach demonstrated in this paper is quantitative, transparent, portable, and efficient at leveraging the strengths of multiple land cover maps over large areas.

TI  - Groundwater and soil salinization and geochemical evolution of Femenin-Ghahavand plain, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical data of 75 groundwater samples and Landsat 8 OLI satellite data were used to identify the source and mechanism of groundwater and soil salinization in Femenin-Ghahavand aquifer (FGA) in Hamadan area, Iran. Generally, the EC values range from 350 to 7556 mu S/cm with a mean value of 1785 mu S/cm. The salinity value increases in the groundwater along the flow direction from southeast to northwest. The water samples are categorized into two water types of HCO3-Ca and Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl-. The water samples are super-saturated with calcite and dolomite due to dissolution of carbonate rocks through the flow path from recharge to discharge zones and under-saturated with respect to gypsum and halite. The most probable source of salinity is dissolution of interlayer of halite and gypsum in Miocene Marl and Qom formation in the bedrock of FGA. Also, the ion exchange is another major process that affects the deep groundwater quality in FGA. The water samples of FGA were divided into two groups based on the HFE diagram. About 71% of the samples are plotted below the mixing line, indicating intrusion process with reverse ion exchange and the rest (29%) is under freshening process with direct ion exchange. Consequently, the source of salinity in FGA groundwater is dissolution of halite and gypsum in deep saline groundwater which is likely upconing and mixing with fresh groundwater during overexploitation. The result of soil investigation using NDS index based on Landsat 8 OLI satellite data shows severe increase in salinization from 2013 to 2019. The areas with saline groundwater have saline soil too, indicating same source of groundwater and soil salinization. However, the main cause of soil salinization would be land use change and irrigation by saline groundwater and high evaporation in the region.

TI  - Spatial and temporal surface temperature patterns across the Dead Sea as investigated from thermal images and thermodynamic concepts
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The annual cycle of the Dead Sea surface temperature was investigated using band 10 onboard Landsat 8 during 2017-2018 and thermodynamic concepts. Retrieved Dead Sea temperatures are congruent with field observations with a mean square error of 1.22 degrees C and a correlation coefficient of 0.983. A new method employing thermodynamic concepts is presented in this paper to address the influence of buoyant plumes generated by freshwater influx on evaporation from hypersaline lakes/lagoons. Thermal images reveal a distinct spatial temperature pattern across the Dead Sea which reflects differential heating and cooling caused by variations in thermophysical characteristics of the deep sea compared with the shallow shoreline. The temperature patterns are negatively skewed in winter and positively skewed in summer. These temporal and spatial temperature patterns were illustrated using observed hourly data combined with energy balance calculations. The presence of buoyant plumes is found to alter evaporation compared with the undisturbed sea brine, and the effect of these plumes on evaporation is controlled by the simultaneous departure of temperature and activity compared with the undisturbed sea brine. Analysis shows that evaporation from buoyant plumes is more likely to be smaller than that from the open sea in winter and larger than its corresponding part from the open sea in summer. Thermal images can be used as surrogates to intensive field campaigns to examine temperature and evaporation regimes of lakes/salt flats.

T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many marine animals aggregate seasonally at predictable locations to exploit their prey in oligotrophic environments, making them vulnerable to human disturbance. The foraging strategies and habitats of manta rays andStenellaspp. in the Solor waters were largely unknown, despite the importance of this information for their effective management, e.g. through the establishment of marine protected areas in this region. Over the last few decades, the use of foraging habitat models in describing the foraging strategy and delineating the predicted habitats has grown in popularity. However, most of these studies have relied on remotely sensed data such as sea surface chlorophyll-ato estimate prey distribution. Very few studies have used the distribution ofin situprey, which is that closer to the trophic level of modelled species, although such a strategy would improve model performance. The study compares foraging habitat model performance for manta rays andStenellaspp. in the waters of Solor using remotely sensed sea surface chlorophyll-aconcentrations andin situzooplankton biomass as proxies for prey quantities and distribution. A Maximum Entropy model that integrated species sightings with environmental predictors was used to quantify the importance of predictors in explaining habitat preference and distribution of manta rays andStenellaspp. and to compare model performance and predict foraging habitats. Results indicate that the use of prey proxy closer to the trophic level of examined species improve model performance, ecological explanations, and spatial predictions. The zooplankton biomass distribution performed much better in explaining the manta rays' habitats compared to that ofStenellaspp., indicating that a trophic level gap might influence the zooplankton's ability to predict foraging habitats ofStenellaspp. This study highlights the importance of integrating foraging habitat models into marine protected area design to ensure the effectiveness of species management.

TI  - Regional Pattern of the Ocean's Biological Pump Based on Geochemical Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the impact of the ocean's biological pump on future atmospheric CO(2)and deep ocean O(2)concentrations, organic matter export rates are poorly known because observations are scarce and mostly short term. Thus, we rely on satellite data and models to yield export rates, yet neither approach is sufficiently validated. We present multiyear export estimates based mainly on observed O(2)and CO(2)surface layer budgets across the Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans and compare to satellite- and model-based estimates. We find that regional variability in observed export is modest (threefold) and lower than model- and satellite-based estimates (threefold to sevenfold). Neither model- nor satellite-based export reproduces the regional export trends in the Pacific. We find that winter mixed layer depth is critical in determining annual export rates in the subpolar N. Atlantic.

TI  - A crop type dataset for consistent land cover classification in Central Asia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Land cover is a key variable in the context of climate change. In particular, crop type information is essential to understand the spatial distribution of water usage and anticipate the risk of water scarcity and the consequent danger of food insecurity. This applies to arid regions such as the Aral Sea Basin (ASB), Central Asia, where agriculture relies heavily on irrigation. Here, remote sensing is valuable to map crop types, but its quality depends on consistent ground-truth data. Yet, in the ASB, such data are missing. Addressing this issue, we collected thousands of polygons on crop types, 97.7% of which in Uzbekistan and the remaining in Tajikistan. We collected 8,196 samples between 2015 and 2018, 213 in 2011 and 26 in 2008. Our data compile samples for 40 crop types and is dominated by "cotton" (40%) and "wheat", (25%). These data were meticulously validated using expert knowledge and remote sensing data and relied on transferable, open-source workflows that will assure the consistency of future sampling campaigns

TI  - Polar substorm on 7 December 2015: preonset phenomena and features of auroral breakup
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensive analysis of a moderate 600 nT substorm was performed using simultaneous optical observations inside the auroral oval and in the polar cap, combined with data from satellites, radars, and ground magnetometers. The onset took place near the poleward boundary of the auroral oval that is not typical for classical substorms. The substorm onset was preceded by two negative excursions of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) Bz component, with a 1 min interval between them, two enhancements of the antisunward convection in the polar cap with the same time interval, and 15 min oscillations in the geomagnetic H component in the auroral zone. The distribution of the pulsation intensity along meridian has two local maxima, namely at the equatorial and poleward boundaries of the auroral oval, where pulsations occurred in the out-of-phase mode resembling the field line resonance. At the initial stage, the auroral breakup developed as the auroral torch stretched and expanded poleward along the meridian. Later it took the form of the largescale coiling structure that also distinguishes the considered substorm from the classical one. Magnetic, radar, and the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) satellite data show that, before the collapse, the coiling structure was located between two field-aligned currents, namely downward at the poleward boundary of structure and upward at the equatorial boundary. The set of GEOTAIL satellites and ground data fit to the near-tail current disruption scenario of the substorm onset. We suggest that the 15 min oscillations might play a role in the substorm initiation.

TI  - Anatomical Variations That Can Lead to Spine Surgery at the Wrong Level: Part III Lumbosacral Spine
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spine surgery at the wrong level is an undesirable event and unique pitfall in spine surgery. It is detrimental to the relationship between the patient and the surgeon and typically results in profound medical and legal consequences. It falls under the wrong-site surgery sentinel events reporting system. This error is most frequently observed in lumbosacral spine. Several risk factors are implicated; however, anatomical variations of the lumbosacral spine are a major risk factor. The aim of this article was to provide a detailed description of these high-risk anatomical variations, including transitional vertebrae, lumbar ribs, butterfly vertebrae, hemivertebra, block/fused vertebrae, and spinal dysraphism. A literature review was performed in the database PubMed to obtain all relative English-only articles concerning these anatomical variations and their implication in the development of lumbosacral spine surgery at the wrong level. We also described patient characteristics that can lead to lumbosacral surgery at the wrong level such as tumors, infection, previous lumbosacral surgery, obesity, and osteoporosis. Certain techniques to prevent such incorrect surgery were explained. Lumbosacral spine anatomical variations are surgically significant. Awareness of their existence may provide better pre-operative planning and surgical intervention, leading to avoidance of incorrect-level surgery and potentially better clinical outcomes. In addition, collaboration with radiologists and careful examination of patient's anatomy and characteristics should be exercised, especially in difficult cases.

TI  - Accuracy of Empirical Satellite Algorithms for Mapping Phytoplankton Diagnostic Pigments in the Open Ocean: A Supervised Learning Perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring phytoplankton community composition from space is an important challenge in ocean remote sensing. Researchers have proposed several algorithms for this purpose. However, the in situ data used to train and validate such algorithms at the global scale are often clustered along ship cruise tracks and in some well-studied locations, whereas many large marine regions have no in situ data at all. Furthermore, oceanographic variables are typically spatially auto-correlated. In this situation, the common practice of validating algorithms with randomly chosen held-out observations can underestimate errors. Based on a global database of in situ HPLC data, we applied supervised learning methods to train and test empirical algorithms predicting the relative concentrations of eight diagnostic pigments that serve as biomarkers for different phytoplankton types. For each pigment, we trained three types of satellite algorithms distinguished by their input data: abundance-based (using only chlorophylla as input), spectral (using remote sensing reflectance), and ecological algorithms (combining reflectance and environmental variables). The algorithms were implemented as statistical models (smoothing splines, polynomials, random forests, and boosted regression trees). To address clustering of data and spatial auto-correlation, we tested the algorithms by means of spatial block cross-validation. This provided a less confident picture of the potential for global mapping of diagnostic pigments and hence the associated phytoplankton types using existing satellite data than suggested by some previous research and a fivefold cross-validation conducted for comparison. Of the eight diagnostic pigments, only two (fucoxanthin and zeaxanthin) could be predicted in marine regions that the algorithms were not trained in with considerably lower errors than a constant null model. Thus, global-scale algorithms based on existing, multispectral satellite data and commonly available environmental variables can estimate relative diagnostic pigment concentrations and hence distinguish phytoplankton types in some broad classes, but are likely inaccurate for some classes and in some marine regions. Overall, the ecological algorithms had the lowest prediction errors, suggesting that environmental variables contain information about the global spatial distribution of phytoplankton groups that is not captured in multi-spectral remote sensing reflectance and satellite-derived Chl a concentrations. Weighting training observations inversely to the degree of spatial clustering improved predictions. Finally, our results suggest that more discussion of the best approaches for training and validating empirical satellite algorithms is needed if the in situ data are unevenly distributed in the study region and spatially clustered.

TI  - Beach Slopes From Satellite-Derived Shorelines
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The steepness of the beach face is a fundamental parameter for coastal morphodynamic research. Despite its importance, it remains extremely difficult to obtain reliable estimates of the beach-face slope over large spatial scales (thousands of km of coastline). In this letter, a novel approach to estimate this slope from time series of satellite-derived shoreline positions is presented. This new technique uses a frequency domain analysis to find the optimum slope that minimizes high-frequency tidal fluctuations relative to lower-frequency erosion/accretion signals. A detailed assessment of this new approach at eight locations spanning a range of tidal regimes, wave climates, and sediment grain sizes shows strong agreement (R-2 = 0.93) with field measurements. The automated technique is then applied across thousands of beaches in eastern Australia and California, USA, revealing similar regional-scale distributions along these two contrasting coastlines and highlights the potential for new global-scale insight to beach-face slope spatial distribution, variability, and trends.

TI  - Using Sentinel-1 Imagery to Assess Predictive Performance of a Hydraulic Model
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study seeks to test the predictive performance of a hydraulic model using as reference the flood extent extracted through Sentinel-1 imagery. A precipitation event which took place between the 22nd and 28th of February 2018 in Pineios river basin, Central Greece, was analyzed. A threshold technique was performed to delineate the inundation extent from the satellite image, whereas both HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS software were coupled to simulate the examined storm event. To assess model response, the flooded area derived through the modeling approach was compared against that derived from the satellite image processing, using an area-based measure of fit. Furthermore, an uncertainty analysis on the parameters of the hydrologic model was elaborated to investigate their impact on the results of the hydraulic model. The sensitivity of the latter to the value of the roughness coefficient as well as to changes in the spatial resolution of the utilized topography was also examined. Considering as a perfect response of the model its complete coincidence with the satellite image product, it was found that the hydraulic model performance ranged between 61.04%-65.49%, depending on the selected upstream flow hydrograph, topography and roughness coefficient. The upstream flow conditions proved to play a more critical role, while roughness coefficient and topography were found to cause slighter changes in model response.

TI  - Complex influences of mechanistic knowledge, worldview, and quantitative reasoning on climate change discourse: Evidence for ideologically motivated reasoning among youth
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic climate change remains divisive in the United States, where skepticism of the scientific consensus is associated with conservative worldviews, resulting in political polarization. This study considers three hypotheses regarding U.S. polarization over climate change that have emerged from social psychology research and applies them to science education by showing how these hypotheses could relate to adolescents' science learning. We then test each hypothesis within an experimental educational intervention designed to study the influence of worldview, mechanistic knowledge, and quantitative reasoning on students' written arguments about climate change. We used mixed methods to analyze the results of this individually randomized trial with clustering involving 357 participants in grades 9-11 from 5 U.S. sites. Findings show that: (a) exposure to mechanistic knowledge about climate change increased odds of receptivity toward climate change; (b) increasingly conservative worldviews were associated with decreased odds of receptivity; (c) worldview and quantitative reasoning interacted, resulting in an amplified effect of worldview for students with greater quantitative reasoning. Results also suggest that the influence of worldview and mechanistic knowledge on receptivity work independently from one another in our dataset. This study demonstrates the value of teaching mechanistic understandings of climate change, yet also demonstrates the influence of worldview on receptivity to climate change for adolescents, as well as complex interactions between quantitative reasoning (something school science aims to develop) and worldview. It shows that moving the U.S. public toward the scientific consensus is complex and involves confronting ideologically motivated reasoning within science education.

TI  - Spiritual care provision to end-of-life patients: A systematic literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Aim To develop an understanding of how nurses provide spiritual care to terminally ill patients in order to develop best practice. Background Patients approaching the end of life (EoL) can experience suffering physically, emotionally, socially and spiritually. Nurses are responsible for assessing these needs and providing holistic care, yet are given little implementable, evidence-based guidance regarding spiritual care. Nurses internationally continue to express inadequacy in assessing and addressing the spiritual domain, resulting in spiritual care being neglected or relegated to the pastoral team. Design Systematic literature review, following PRISMA guidelines. Methods Nineteen electronic databases were systematically searched and papers screened. Quality was appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative checklist, and deductive thematic analysis, with a priori themes, was conducted. Results Eleven studies provided a tripartite understanding of spiritual caregiving within the a priori themes:Nursing Spirit (a spiritual holistic ethos); the Soul of Care (the nurse-patient relationship); and the Body of Care (nurse care delivery). Ten of the studies involved palliative care nurses. Conclusion Nurses who provide spiritual care operate from an integrated holistic worldview, which develops from personal spirituality, life experience and professional practice of working with the dying. This worldview, when combined with advanced communication skills, shapes a relational way of spiritual caregiving that extends warmth, love and acceptance, thus enabling a patient's spiritual needs to surface and be resolved. Relevance to clinical practice Quality spiritual caregiving requires time for nurses to develop: the personal, spiritual and professional skills that enable spiritual needs to be identified and redressed; nurse-patient relationships that allow patients to disclose and co-process these needs. Supportive work environments underpin such care. Further research is required to define spiritual care across all settings, outside of hospice, and to develop guidance for those involved in EoL care delivery.

TI  - The use of sentinel logs to assess host shifts in early beetle colonisers of deadwood under climate- and forestry-induced tree species substitutions
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global change scenarios project drastic modifications in tree species range and an increase in exotic tree plantations. Subsequent tree species substitutions may alter habitat conditions for biodiversity. We measured substitutability between tree species for early deadwood colonisers, through a sentinel log approach, i.e. through the experimental exposure of paired down deadwood (DDW) pieces to native beetles in native stands. We compared two native/substitute tree species pairs: one conifer pair composed of a rapidly expanding exotic species (Douglas fir) and a declining native species (silver fir), and one deciduous pair composed of two native species, one expanding (sessile oak) and one retreating (beech) at the regional scale. The effects of expanding exotic and native trees on beetle communities were not in line with expectations. Species assemblages in Douglas fir DDW were indistinguishable from those in native silver fir DDW and did not contain fewer species. Assemblages were not more generalist on average in substitutes than in substituted trees: we did not note any decrease in species richness of functional groups to the detriment of specialist species. Moreover, species richness and abundance were higher in substitute oak than in native beech DDW, confirming that species from the regional pool were able to colonise oak, even though it is a minor tree species at the regional level. Large-scale monitoring schemes including multi-taxon, multi-year and multiple native/substitute pairs would further our knowledge of the generic effects of tree species substitution on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Wanted: Angela Davis and a Jury of Her Peers
T2  - POLITICAL THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1972 Angela Davis stood trial on charges of conspiracy, kidnapping, and murder before a White jury. A professor of philosophy, a Communist, and a member of the Black Panther Party, she had no reason to believe that any of the jurors were her peers. Yet, after three days of deliberation, they returned a Not Guilty verdict on each of the counts. Through an analysis of the case, this essay argues for a new approach to peerhood that defines it as a combination of (1) demographic similarities to the defendant and (2) a worldview orientation of contestation and anticorruption that emerges from the jury's function in the trial. Greater clarity on how these factors are important for peerhood provides insights into how jurors can best fulfill their role and what remedies are necessary to achieve a jury of one's peers.

TI  - Comparison of GOME-2 UVA Satellite Data to Ground-Based UVA Measurements in South Africa
T2  - PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite estimates of surface ultraviolet A (UVA) (315-400 nm) from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME)-2 were compared to ground-based measurements at four stations in South Africa for 2015. The comparison of daily exposure and daily maximum irradiance was completed for all-sky and clear-sky conditions. There is a strong linear correlation between the satellite and ground-based data with a correlation coefficient (r) between 0.86 and 0.97 for all-sky conditions. However, at three of the stations the satellite data are underestimated compared to ground-based data with a mean bias error (MBE) between -8.7% and -20.6%. A seasonal analysis indicated that there is a link between the bias in ground-based and GOME-2 UVA and cloud fraction. Factors such as aerosols, surface albedo, altitude and data resolution may contribute to the underestimations found at the three sites. These results indicate that satellite estimates of surface UVA over South Africa do not exhibit the same behavior as other stations around the world and therefore require further validation.

TI  - Water balance assessment using remote sensing, Wet-Spass model, CN-SCS, and GIS for water resources management in Saiss Plain (Morocco)
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Saiss plain contains an important aquifer. This complex groundwater system plays an important socio-economic role. Managing the groundwater resources requests a good understanding of resources availability and human needs satisfaction. These two components are estimated to get annual water balance of Saiss aquifer. Resources availability depends on meteorological parameters (rainfall, wind speed, temperature, etc.), soil types, topography, water table, and land use. Previous studies do not consider all of these parameters in assessing the water resources availability in this region. In this study, we have identified the relationship between all Saiss hydro-meteorological parameters and we have organized all data in Geographic Information System (GIS) to assess inputs of the water balance. Meteorological and hydrological data and landuse/landcover maps obtained from Landsat imageries classification were used in Wet-Spass (water and energy transfer between soil, plants, and atmosphere under quasi-steady state) model and Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (CN-SCS) method to assess annual runoff, potential evapotranspiration, interception, actual evapotranspiration, and natural recharge of shallow aquifer of Saiss plain. The results of the water balance calculation indicate significant fluctuations in the aquifer recharge: 280 Mm(3) (1987) and 418 Mm(3) (2018). The annual direct runoff increased from 344 Mm(3) (1987) to 638 Mm(3) (2018).

TI  - Assessment of mining activities on tree species and diversity in hilltop mining areas using Hyperion and Landsat data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The tree species and its diversity are two critical components to be monitored for sustainable management of forest as well as biodiversity conservation. In the present study, we have classified the tree species and estimated its diversity based on hyperspectral remote sensing data at a fine scale level in the Saranda forest. This area is situated near the mining fields and has a dense forest cover around it. The forest surrounding the study area is exhibiting high-stress condition as evidenced by the dying and dry plant material, consequently affecting tree species and its diversity. The preprocessing of 242 Hyperion (hyperspectral) spectral wavebands resulted in 145 corrected spectral wavebands. The 21 spectral wavebands were selected through discrimination analysis (Walk's Lambda test) for tree species analysis. The SVM (support vector machine), SAM (spectral angle mapper), and MD (minimum distance) algorithms were applied for tree species classification based on ground spectral data obtained from the spectroradiometer. We have identified six local tree species in the study area at the spatial level. The result shows that Sal and Teak tree species are located in the upper and lower hilly sides of two mines (Meghahatuburu and Kiriburu). We have also used hyperspectral narrow banded vegetation indices (VIs) for species diversity estimation based on the field-measured Shannon diversity index. The statistical result shows that NDVI705 (red edge normalized difference vegetation index) is having the bestR(2)(0.76) and lowest RMSE (0.04) for species diversity estimation. That is why we have used NDVI705 for species diversity estimation. The result shows that higher species diversity values are located in the upper and lower hilly sides of two mines. The linear regression between Hyperion and field measured Shannon index shows theR(2)(0.72) and RMSE (0.15). This study will aid in effective geoenvironmental planning and management of forest in the hilltop mining areas.

TI  - Improvement in cloud retrievals from VIIRS through the use of infrared absorption channels constructed from VIIRS plus CrIS data fusion
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieval of semitransparent ice cloud properties from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite sensor on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP)and NOAA-20 platforms is challenging due to the absence of infrared (IR)water vapor and CO2 absorption channels. However, on these platforms,there is a companion sensor called the Crosstrack Infrared Sounder (CrIS)that provides these spectral measurements but at a lower spatial resolution (similar to 15 km at nadir). To mitigate the lack of VIIRS spectral measurements in these IR absorption channels, recent studies suggest an approach to supplement VIIRS measurements by fusion of the imager and sounder data. In particular, Weisz et al. (2017) demonstrate a method to construct IR water vapor and CO2 absorption channel radiances for VIIRS at 750 m spatial resolution. Based on these constructed channels for both S-NPP and NOAA-20, this study evaluates three cloud properties - cloud mask, cloud thermodynamic phase, and cloud top height - through comparison to the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation/Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIPSO/CALIOP) V4-20 cloud layer products and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 cloud top products. Each of these cloud properties shows improvement with the use of these constructed channel radiances. The major improvement for the cloud mask is found over polar regions, where the correct cloud detection percentage increases due to a decrease in missed clouds and/or false detection. For cloud thermodynamic phase, the ice cloud fraction increases over non-polar regions and the combined liquid water and ice cloud discrimination improves in comparison with CALIPSO. The retrieved cloud top height for semitransparent ice clouds increases over non-polar regions and tends to be closer to the true CALIPSO/CALIOP cloud top height. Moreover, the uncertainty of cloud top height retrievals decreases globally for these clouds.

TI  - Medical Maximizing-Minimizing Preferences in Relation to Low-Value Services for Older Women with Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Qualitative Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Multiple studies have demonstrated the safety of omitting therapies in older women with breast cancer. Despite de-implementation guidelines, up to 65% of older women continue to receive one or more of these low-value services. Previous work has investigated the role of both provider and patient attitudes as barriers to de-implementation; however, the importance of the patient's maximizing-minimizing preferences within this context remains unclear. Methods In this qualitative study, we conducted 30 semi-structured interviews with women >= 70 years of age without a previous diagnosis of breast cancer to elicit perspectives on breast cancer treatment in relation to their medical maximizing-minimizing preferences, as determined by the single-item maximizer-minimizer elicitation question (MM1). We used an interpretive description approach in analysis to produce a thematic survey. Results Participants were relatively evenly distributed across the MM1 (minimizer,n = 8; neutral,n = 13; maximizer,n = 9). Despite being told of recommendations allowing for the safe omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy and post-lumpectomy radiotherapy, maximizers consistently stated preferences for more medical intervention and aggressive therapies over minimizers and neutral individuals. Conclusion Medical maximizing-minimizing preferences in older women correspond with preferences for breast cancer treatment options that guidelines identify as potentially unnecessary. Increased awareness of patient-level variability in maximizing-minimizing preferences may be valuable in developing optimal intervention strategies to reduce utilization of low-value care.

TI  - Post-failure landslide change detection and analysis using optical satellite Sentinel-2 images
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-failure landslide change detection is crucial for mitigation strategies. However, the methods used to investigate this issue all involve a tough workflow, and the free access Sentinel-2 satellite is underutilized. In this study, we use ten Sentinel-2 optical images to explore the effectiveness of using these images to detect post-landslide changes in the Huangnibazi landslide failure using an easy workflow. We found that the landslide can be qualitatively divided into a startup and acceleration stage, a front and lateral edge expansion stage, and a stabilization stage using time-series true color images. After the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated to identify landslide scars, which were validated using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) orthoimages, we found that the same three change processes identified were also reflected by the landslide scar count change analysis in a quantitative way. Based on the three different stages, a red-green-blue (RGB) composite of the NDVI images was constructed and was found to reflect the different change period of the right and left landslide edges. Most importantly, the changes within a pixel unit were detected using an NDVI RGB composite with cold colors representing a retrogressive landslide mode. All of these findings indicate that the huge potential of the use of Sentinel-2 images in similar applications.

TI  - An Improved Beta Method for Ice Cloud Property Retrievals: Theory
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The beta method has long been used for ice cloud property retrievals with the utilization of thermal infrared observations. The method assumes an idealized cloud that is isothermal and does not scatter radiation, which results in systematic biases in ice cloud property retrievals. We improve the beta method by taking into account, for the first time since the beta method was developed, a nonisothermal cloud layer and the cloud scattering effects. The improved beta method provides almost unbiased cloud optical thickness retrievals for typical cirrus clouds and reduces the systematic biases of effective particle radius retrievals for optically thin clouds. The improved beta method does not involve either Jacobian or iterative radiative transfer calculations. As a result, this method is computationally efficient, robustly applicable to any historical and current spaceborne thermal infrared observations, and capable of processing a large amount of satellite data.

TI  - How many sea scallops are there and why does it matter?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic conditions along the Atlantic Coast of North America are changing rapidly. Surface water temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have increased faster than 99% of the global oceans, and major infrastructure projects, including the largest windfarm in the world, are under development along this seaboard. In Canada and theUS, the Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) supports lucrative fisheries, which were originally founded on an extensive scientific framework focusing on stock assessment. The sea scallop is an ideal sentinel species, as it is highly sensitive to changes in marine conditions. We used a drop camera system to estimate the number and size of scallops, as well as the distribution of their reproductive potential, over 70,000 km(2)of the continental shelf in 2016-2018, an area that nearly covers the entire range of this species. In total, we estimated that there were 34 billion individual scallops (95% confidence limits: 22-46 billion) within the species' range. In this paper, we examine the role of the sea scallop as a baseline sentinel species that can be used to measure the impacts of environmental change and anthropogenic developments.

TI  - Large-Scale Industrial Cloud Perturbations Confirm Bidirectional Cloud Water Responses to Anthropogenic Aerosols
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols offset a poorly quantified fraction of anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming, and the aerosol impact on clouds is the most uncertain mechanism of anthropogenic climate forcing. Here observations of a relatively weak average response of liquid cloud water to aerosol perturbations are extended to much larger areas than in previous studies, with the polluted cloud areas covering hundreds by hundreds of kilometers. Polluted clouds detected in satellite images at the global anthropogenic air pollution hot spot of Norilsk, Russia, and at other various major aerosol source regions show close compensation between aerosol-induced cloud water increases and decreases. In the sampled Norilsk cloud perturbations the decrease in liquid water path offsets 3% of the radiative forcing through the Twomey effect on average. Weak cloud water response on average in large polluted areas is in very good agreement with previous results based on observations of small-scale ship-track-like industrial cloud perturbations, helping to reduce the uncertainty associated with the anthropogenic aerosol impacts on clouds.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Characteristics of Urban Surface Temperature and Its Relationship with Landscape Metrics and Vegetation Cover in Rapid Urbanization Region
T2  - COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the trend of rapid urbanization, the urban heat island (UHI) effect has become a hot issue for scholars to study. In order to better alleviate UHI effect, it is important to understand the effect of landuse/landcover (LULC) and landscape patterns on the urban thermal environment from perspective of landscape ecology. This research aims to quantitatively investigate the effect of LULC landscape patterns on UHI effects more accurately based on a landscape metrics analysis. In addition, we also explore the complex relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation cover. Taking Zhengzhou City of China as a case study, an integrated method which includes the geographic information system (GIS), remote-sensing (RS) technology, and landscape metrics was employed to facilitate the analysis. Landsat data (2000-2014) were applied to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of LST and LULC. The results indicated that the mean LST value increased by 2.32 degrees C between 2000 and 2014. The rise of LST was consistent with the trend of rapid urbanization in Zhengzhou City, which resulted in sharp increases in impervious surfaces (IS) and substantial losses of vegetation cover. Furthermore, the investigation of LST and vegetation cover demonstrated that fractional vegetation cover (FVC) had a stronger negative effect on LST than normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). In addition, LST was obviously correlated with LULC landscape patterns, and both landscape composition and spatial configuration affected UHI effects to varying degrees. This study not only illustrates a feasible way to investigate the relationship between LULC and urban thermal environment but also suggests some important measures to improve urban planning to reduce UHI effects for sustainable development.

TI  - Assessment of calanchi and rill-interrill erosion susceptibilities using terrain analysis and geostochastics: A case study in the Oltrepo Pavese, Northern Apennines, Italy
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is one of the most important environmental problems distributed worldwide. In the last decades, numerous studies have been published on the assessment of soil erosion and the related processes and forms using empirical, conceptual and physically based models. For the prediction of the spatial distribution, more and more sophisticated stochastic modelling approaches have been proposed - especially on smaller spatial scales such as river basins. In this work, we apply a maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to evaluate badlands (calanchi) and rill-interrill (sheet erosion) areas in the Oltrepo Pavese (Northern Apennines, Italy). The aim of the work is to assess the important environmental predictors that influence calanchi and rill-interrill erosion at the regional scale. We used 13 topographic parameters derived from a 12 m digital elevation model (TanDEM-X) and data on the lithology and land use. Additional information about the vegetation is introduced through the normalized difference vegetation index based on remotely sensed data (ASTER images). The results are presented in the form of susceptibility maps showing the spatial distribution of the occurrence probability for calanchi and rill-interrill erosion. For the validation of the MaxEnt model results, a support vector machine approach was applied. The models show reliable results and highlight several locations of the study area that are potentially prone to future soil erosion. Thus, coping and mitigation strategies may be developed to prevent or fight the soil erosion phenomenon under consideration. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Accuracies of support vector machine and random forest in rice mapping with Sentinel-1A, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A datasets
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - SVM and RF are widely used in rice mapping. However, their performance with single and different combinations of satellite datasets is rarely reported. Hence we report their rice mapping accuracies for two seasons using Sentinel-1A, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A images. The VH and VV polarizations of Sentinel-1A, and two spectral indices (SIs) of Landsat-8 and Sentine1-2A were used to obtain seven datasets (VH, VV, SI, VHVV, VHSI, VVSI and VHVVSI), and on which SVM and RF were applied and accuracies were assessed. VHSI showed the highest overall accuracy for both algorithms in both years. SVM with VHSI had a slightly higher accuracy (90.8%) than RF with VHSI (89.2%) in 2015 while in 2016 RF with VHSI showed a slightly higher accuracy (95.2%) than SVM with VHSI (93.4%). Although they produced equivalent accuracies within years, RF is more sensitive to additional data, given a 6.0% increase from 2015 to 2016 with VHSI.

TI  - Influence of Ch substitution on structural, electronic, and thermoelectric properties of layered oxychalcogenides (La<sub>0.5</sub>Bi<sub>0.5</sub>O)CuCh (Ch = S, Se, Te): a new insight from first principles
T2  - RSC ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We study the structural, electronic, and thermoelectric properties of p-type layered oxychalcogenides (La0.5Bi0.5O)CuCh (Ch = S, Se, Te) from first principles. Ch substitution from S to Te enhances the local-symmetry distortions (LSDs) in CuCh(4)and OLa(2)Bi(2)tetrahedra, where the LSD in OLa(2)Bi(2)is more pronounced. The LSD in CuCh(4)tetrahedra comes from the possible pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect, indicated by the degeneracy-lifted t(2g)and e(g)states of Cu 3d(10)orbital. The Ch substitution decreases bandgap from 0.529, 0.256 (Gamma -> 0.4 Delta), to 0.094 eV (Z -> 0.4 Delta), for Ch = S, Se, Te, respectively, implying the increasing carrier concentration and electrical conductivity. The split-off energy at Z and Gamma points are also increased by the substitution. The valence band shows deep O 2p states in the electron-confining [LaBiO2](2+)layers, which is essential for thermoelectricity. (La0.5Bi0.5O)CuTe provides the largest thermoelectric power from the Seebeck coefficient and the carriers concentration, which mainly come from Te 5p(x)/p(y), Cu 3d(zx), and Cu 3d(zy)states. The valence band shows the partial hybridization of t(2g)and Chp states, implied by the presence of nonbonding valence t(2g)states. This study provides new insights, which predict experimental results and are essential for novel functional device applications.

TI  - Evolving a total-evaluation map of flash flood hazard for hydro-prioritization based on geohydromorphometric parameters and GIS-RS manner in Al-Hussain river basin, Tartous, Syria
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are one of the most severe hydrological hazards that cause an excessive threat to landscape stability, population welfare, infrastructure and spatial development in the Syrian coastal region. Al-Hussain river basin, like other Syrian coastal basins, is prone to a hazardous, frequent-flooding threat. However, investigating the probable areas of flooding risk is a difficult challenge that results from the almost complete absence of spatially distributed geo-hydrological measurements in Al-Hussain river basin. In this regard, geohydromorphometric parameters (Stream numberN(u), Stream lengthL(u), Bifurcation ratioR(b), Form factorF, Elongation ratioE(b), Drainage densityD(d), Stream frequencyF(s), Drainage textureT(d), Lemniscate ratioK, Compactness indexC, Circulatory ratioR(c), Ruggedness numberR(n), Basin reliefH(r), and Relief ratioR(r)) derived from remote sensing data in the GIS environment can provide a comprehensive and objective approach that can be utilized to map the spatial distribution of flood hazards at the level of delineated sub-basins. This being the case, the present research focuses on exploring the spatial distribution of flood risk in ten sub-basins belonging to Al-Hussain river basin by using spatial techniques tools in order to overall determine the hydro-prioritization of conservation. The geo-visualization map of generated flash flood susceptibility evaluates five degrees of the flood risk: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The flood risk map indicates that Qalea, and Talaa sub-basins have massive hydrodynamic risk, which, in turn, indicates the urgent need of soil and water maintaining measures. This hydrological dynamic in these sub-basins is explained by high values ofD(d),F,R-r,R-n,R-c, andK, respectively. Overall, the spatial outcomes of the current work successfully proved the efficiency of extracted geohydromorphometric layers from RS data in the context of the spatial assessment of flash flood hazard; they also ensure ecological sustainability and productivity of the study basin.

TI  - Omission of Axillary Lymph Node Dissection is Associated with Inferior Survival in Breast Cancer Patients with Residual N1 Nodal Disease Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The appropriateness of substituting sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) and regional nodal irradiation (RNI) for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with residual lymph node (LN) disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is unknown. We used the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to compare survival following SLND and ALND in breast cancer patients with residual LN disease.Methods. We analyzed NCDB patients, treated between 2006 and 2014, with cT1-3, cN1, cM0 breast cancer and residual disease in 1-3 axillary LNs (ypN1) following NAC. Patients were grouped into those who received SLND (defined as removal of <= 4 LNs) and RNI, or ALND and RNI. Patients were matched for all patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics.Results. We identified 1313 eligible patients in the ALND group and 304 patients in the SLND group. For the matched cohorts, SLND was associated with significantly lower survival in both univariate and doubly robust multivariable analyses (MVA) (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.2, P < 0.001 for MVA), with estimated 5-year OS of 71%, compared with 77% in the ALND group (P = 0.01). Exploratory subgroup analyses showed that SLND was comparable with ALND in patients with luminal A or B tumors with a single metastatic LN (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.59-1.8, P = 0.91).Conclusions. Our analysis suggests that, while an ALND may not be needed for patients with limited residual nodal burden and biologically favorable tumors, SLND should not be routinely substituted for ALND in patients with ypN1 disease following NAC until its efficacy is confirmed by prospective trials.

TI  - Potential flood risk due to urbanization expansion in arid environments, Saudi Arabia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization of watersheds is known to increase the flood risk potentials. Since 1970, eastern Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, underwent rapid urbanization due to the high rate of population growth and the booming economy, which attracts hundreds of thousands of expatriates. Such urbanizations change drastically the flood characteristics and enhance the risk from such watersheds as shown in 2009 and 2011 severe floods. To investigate the general relationship between the increases in flood peaks following historical urbanization in eastern Jeddah watersheds, satellite remote sensing data and meteorological data are developed. The utilization of high-resolution remote sensing data in temporal data analysis resulted in high classification accuracies using support vector machine as a classifier algorithm. The study area was classified into five different types of land use/land cover to quantify the changes that occurred between the bare rock and bare soil land cover classes. Three different data sets of images were synchronized with rainfall records, and hydrological data are used via watershed modeling systems. Such models are also used to obtain a quantitative estimate of the current potential risks. It is concluded that on average, the peak flows and the volumes increased by about 119% and about 89%, respectively.

AB  - To facilitate scientific decision-making and geohazard prevention and mitigation during the construction and operation of an electricity transmission line projects in Tibet, China, this paper used remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technologies to semi-automatically extract potential geohazards along this line which pose threats to the transmission towers from the perspective of drainage basin, especially for the high-speed and long run-out geohazards, such as glacial landslides and debris flows (triggered by glacial lake burst and rainstorm). Spatial analysis tools are used to model the relationships among different geohazards and towers, according to the development and movement laws of each kind of geological disasters and position information of the towers. Using the proposed extraction model, 37 geohazards posing direct threats to 93 towers were automatically filtered. These were corroborated by field investigations and should be monitored during the following construction and line operation stage. The results show that the proposed model based on spatial analysis can quickly filter and locate geohazards and the corresponding towers, especially for the hazards with a long distance to the transmission towers, and effectively reduce the workload of field investigation.

TI  - Contribution of remote sensing and GIS to mapping the fire risk of Mediterranean forest case of the forest massif of Tlemcen (North-West Algeria)
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are one of the major environmental problems that cause harmful economic and ecological damage. The Algerian forest and in particular the Tlemcen forest massif where the national park is located are very affected by the repetition and the danger of fires. We count 1600 fire starts recorded during the period from 1980 to 2015. This situation is influenced by the ecotourism status and the high human accessibility, in the forest area as well as the significant development of road infrastructure in the middle of the forest. Noting also the characteristics of the plant formations and topographical in the area seriously promote the flammability and combustibility of the vegetation. Faced with this problem, it is necessary to protect the Tlemcen forest massif by mapping the risk zoning of forest fires. In order to achieve this objective, we followed an approach inspired by the Turkish model developed by Erten et al. (In: XXth ISPRS congress, youth forum, July 12-23, 2004, Istanbul, Turkey, pp 33-39, 2004) and based on the multi-criteria analysis method AHP with a hierarchical combination of six parameters, ecological, topographic and human on the one hand, and a classification of these parameters according to their sensitivities to fires on the other hand. This uses remote sensing data and GIS tools. The results obtained gave five risk classes (very low, low, medium, high and very high); the high and very high risk occupy 48.27% of the total surface studied. The validation of these results was made by the multitemporal analysis of satellite images dating from 2001 to 2017 and the superimposition of the burnt spaces detected on the fire risk map. The final documents provide valuable assistance to decision-makers and facilitate the protection and sustainable management of forests.

TI  - Protohistoric pastoral landscape in northern Istria revealed by airborne LiDAR: hill forts, enclosures and long linear walls in the Mali Kras plateau (southwestern Slovenia)
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of an international research aimed at investigating the ancient landscape of the Mali Kras plateau, a sector of northern Istria (southwestern Slovenia). The remains of two main protohistoric hill forts, Mali Kras and Socerb, and a few minor sites were already reported from this area. A cemetery, associated with Socerb hill fort, was in use between the sixth century BC and the first century AD. Airborne LiDAR remote sensing of Mali Kras plateau has allowed to identify several unknown archaeological features, ranging from approximately square features (30 x 30 m) to larger enclosures with different shapes, very long linear features and stone mounds. The elaboration and digitization of high-definition remote sensing data compared with historical cartography, field surveys, targeted small-scale excavations and thermoluminescence dating have been performed in order to decode the complex archaeological palimpsest. The square structures can be attributed to Middle-Recent Bronze Age on the basis of pottery finds. These structures are located close to natural passages from the plateau to the gulf of Trieste, in areas with low visibility and scarcity of soil, which were traditionally used for grazing activities. The other identified enclosures, some of them sharing a similar chronology, were also probably used for pastoral activities but for other purposes since their shape and size are different. Two main long drystone walls define the southeastern sector of Mali Kras plateau in correspondence of the most accessible entrance to the area. The preliminary data and comparisons with similar structures suggest these walls could correspond to protohistoric linear boundaries built to delimit grazing or agricultural areas under direct control of the nearby settlements. The enclosures identified at Mali Kras plateau, most probably connected to herding activities, and perhaps the long linear walls too, could reflect the development of new husbandry practices in the Middle-Recent Bronze Age in the karst areas of the north Adriatic hinterland, such as observed in the alpine territory.

TI  - The complexity of calculating an accurate carbonate budget
T2  - CORAL REEFS
M3  - Article
AB  - A carbonate budget is a comprehensive measure of reef health and function that focuses on processes that produce and remove carbonate. A key parameter of a carbonate budget is reef topographic complexity, or rugosity, that is traditionally measured by the chain-and-tape (CT) method. However, to overcome spatial limitations of the CT method, modern studies are moving towards remote sensing data to quantify complexity on a reef-wide scale. Here, we compare rugosity values calculated using the traditional CT method with rugosity values derived from remote sensing, and assess implications of methodological approach for carbonate production estimates. Rugosities derived from remote sensing were calculated from high-resolution (0.1 m) LiDAR bathymetry from two turbid reefs in the Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, and included virtual chain and tape (VCT), arc-chord ratio (ACR), and surface area to planar area (SAPA). Rugosity values varied significantly between methods (ranges: CT = 1.04-2.15, VCT = 1.01-1.10, ACR and SAPA = 1.00-1.07). Coral carbonate production rates calculated using the CT method were typical of turbid water reefs (2.9 and 3.8 kg m(-2) yr(-1)) which were 30% greater than rates calculated using remote sensing. This variation questions the reliability and comparability of carbonate budgets using remote assessments of reef rugosity with previous budget studies that used the CT method. Given the limitations of remote sensing when capturing fine-scale reef rugosity, we propose that CT is currently a more appropriate method than remote sensing for quantifying rugosity within carbonate budget studies.

TI  - How collective and personal mortality salience impacts antagonism against worldview-threatening others
T2  - DEATH STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted a study in Japan using terror management theory (N = 115) to examine these predictions: first, personal morality salience (MS) would increase antagonism against worldview-threatening others; second, priming to reinforce collective identity would be more effective to strengthen participants' sense of security and thus lower antagonism toward an in-group critic under personal MS than collective MS. The results revealed a significant interaction between MS types and identity priming. Participants were most tolerant toward worldview-threatening others upon awareness of a crisis threatening the group providing them collective identity. These findings provide insight into understanding individual behaviors during social unrest.

TI  - Research on the Complexity of Forms and Structures of Urban Green Spaces Based on Fractal Models
T2  - COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The fractal nature of urban green spaces is the product of the self-organizing evolution of the complex urban system into a higher stage, and orderly patterns and complex structures of urban green spaces will tend to manifest after they develop to a certain stage. On the basis of GF1 satellite data in 2019 and three fractal models, the complexity of the forms and structures of a green space system in downtown Dalian, China, was studied. The results showed that the boundary dimension measured by the perimeter-scale model was 0.64-1.40, and the boundary dimension measured by the area-perimeter model was 1.79-1.99; these results indicate that the degree of human disturbance in green space boundaries was high, and the stability of the green space spatial structures was poor. The grid dimension measured by the area-scale model was 0.49-1.42, and the average radius dimension measured by the area-radius model was 0.35-0.76; these results indicate that the balance of the spatial distribution of green spaces was low, and the green spaces were excessively concentrated in the city center. Through comparisons of the scaling range among various types of green spaces, the characteristic range (gradient structure) of the spatial distribution of urban green spaces was found, which can reflect the maturity of green space growth and the quality of the green space layout. The gradient structure of green spaces in Dalian was characterized by three gradients, namely, 0-4000 m, 4000-8000 m, and 8000-16,000 m. The development of green spaces in the first gradient zone was the best, and the second and third gradient zones showed relatively large potential for improvement. These research results are of practical significance for guiding the planning and construction of green spaces in urban areas.

TI  - Annual report of the Japanese Breast Cancer Registry for 2017
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Japanese Breast Cancer Society Registry started in 1975; it was transferred to the registry platform of the National Clinical Database in 2012. We provide the annual data and an analysis of the Breast Cancer Registry for 2017. Methods Patients' characteristics and pathological data of the 95,203 registered Japanese breast cancer patients from 1,427 institutes in 2017 were obtained. Trends in age at diagnosis and pathological stage were determined during the most recent 6 years (2012-2017). Results The mean onset age was 60.2 years with bimodal peaks at 45-49 years and 65-69 years. A short-term trend of the most recent 6 years of data caused the second, older peak. At diagnosis, 32.4% of breast cancer patients were premenopausal. The distribution of stages revealed that the proportion of early stage breast cancer (stage 0-I) increased up to 60%. At the initial diagnosis, 2.2% of patients presented with metastatic disease. Sentinel node biopsy without axillary node dissection was performed without neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in 68.8%, and with NAC in 31.1%, of patients. For patients without NAC, lymph node metastasis was less than 3% if the tumor size was less than 1 cm. The proportion of node-negativity decreased to 79.5% when tumor size was 2.1-5 cm. Conclusions This analysis of the registry provides new information for effective treatment in clinical practice, cancer prevention, and the conduct of clinical trials. Further development of the registry and progress in collecting prognostic data will greatly enhance its scientific value.

TI  - The influence of risk preferences, knowledge, land consolidation, and landscape diversification on pesticide use
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Researchers have spent substantial effort to identify factors influencing pesticide use intensity. However, few studies have compared the relative importance of these factors. This study examines four categories of factors that potentially influence farmers' pesticide use decisions by evaluating incentivized experiment data, farm survey data, and remote sensing data in China. Our results suggest that land diversification has the largest effect on farmers' pesticide use. Compared with the most rice-intensive landscape type, less rice-intensive systems cause farmers to spray less on middle rice. Heavy pesticide use intensity is associated with land fragmentation as small-scale farms still dominate crop production. Farmers' integrated pest management knowledge has significant effects on pesticide use. We also find that loss and ambiguity preferences, rather than risk preferences, are more likely to affect pesticide use intensity.

TI  - Measuring Realistic and Symbolic Threats of COVID-19 and Their Unique Impacts on Well-Being and Adherence to Public Health Behaviors
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PERSONALITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 threatens lives, livelihoods, and civic institutions. Although restrictive public health behaviors such as social distancing help manage its impact, these behaviors can further sever our connections to people and institutions that affirm our identities. Three studies (N= 1,195) validated a brief 10-item COVID-19 Threat Scale that assesses (1) realistic threats to physical or financial safety and (2) symbolic threats to one's sociocultural identity. Studies reveal that both realistic and symbolic threats predict higher distress and lower well-being and demonstrate convergent validity with other measures of threat sensitivity. Importantly, the two kinds of threats diverge in their relationship to restrictive public health behaviors: Realistic threat predicted greater self-reported adherence, whereas symbolic threat predictedlessself-reported adherence to social disconnection behaviors. Symbolic threat also predicted using creative ways to affirm identity even in isolation. Our findings highlight how social psychological theory can be leveraged to understand and predict people's behavior in pandemics.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the acceleration of urbanization, the heat island effect, as a prominent feature of urban climate, has attracted more attention. Differences in urban landscape patterns have an essential impact on the urban thermal environment. The objective of the study is to examine the impact of urban landscape types and patterns on surface temperature. Taking Zhengzhou City, China, as an example, using Google Earth remote sensing images, an urban landscape type map was created, and landscape indices were calculated. The land surface temperature (LST) of the study area was retrieved by the Landsat-8 thermal infrared band. Correlation analysis indicated that the relationships between urban landscape patterns and the thermal environment were as follows: (i) The scale indices (percentage of landscape (PLAND), largest patch index (LPI), edge density (ED), patch density (PD)) of urban landscape types with cooling effect (water body, riverfront area, park, high-rise building) were significantly negative correlated with mean LST of each partition. (ii) Conversely, there were significant positive correlations between the PLAND and LPI of landscape types with warming effect (block, development land, railway land) and the LST of the partition. (iii) The DIVISION index of the four kinds of landscapes with cooling effect was highly positively correlated with LST, and the DIVISION and SPLIT indices of the three kinds of landscapes with warming effect displayed a remarkable negative relationship with LST. Therefore, under the condition of scale control, integrated distribution of landscape with cooling effect, scattered distribution of landscape with warming effect, and reduced connectivity of landscape with warming effect will contribute to effectively alleviating the formation of urban heat islands.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research was done in Legedadi watershed since the area was highly susceptible to soil erosion problem that could be aggravated by heavy rainfall, and steep slope. The aim of the present study was to examine the impact of LULC change on soil erosion potential in Legedadi watershed, and its implication on sedimentation problems. Multi-temporal Landsat imagery of TM (1985), TM (1997) and ETM+ (2013) were deployed to categorize a LULC map of the study watershed. Soil erosion risk was calculated by using GIS and RUSLE. Digital image processing and classification technique have been done using ERDAS Imagine 9. 2. Results indicate that there was a continuous and active LULC change observed in the watershed for the last 28 years. The settlement area and cultivated land were increased by 14.34% and 18.3%, whereas grazing land and bare land classes were reduced continuously by 25.74% and 18.47% between (1985-2103) respectively. The estimated annual soil losses were 0.0-330 t ha(-1)year(-1)in 2013 whereas in 1997 its range was 0-257.1 t ha(-1)year(-1). A mean annual soil loss in the watershed was 54.19 t ha(-1)year(-1)in 1997and 66.21 t ha(-1)year(-1)in 2013, respectively. The average annual soil loss from each sub-watershed ranges from 34.57-89.19 t ha(-1)year(-1). This calls for the coordinated action of the local communities and government in ensuring sustainable natural resource conservation systems considering the Climate Resilient Green Economy strategy of Ethiopia.

TI  - Land and human resources vulnerability to the impact of climate change in ecologically important coastal regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change induced coastline changes and rising sea levels are likely to create vulnerable impacts on ecosystems, infrastructure, and associated populations the world over. The assessment of long term coastline changes in the past, coupled with the expected changes due to rising sea levels in the future, would aid in comprehending the response of the coastal processes to climate change so as to develop management measures. The coastline variations were delineated by multi dated Landsat satellite images of 45 years using spatial analysis and Digital Shoreline Analysis System. Submergence due to projected sea-level elevation of 50 cm and 100 cm was assessed using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission topographical data using geospatial techniques. The results revealed that the major shore is in the process of erosion at varying rates as well as periods. The highest mean erosion was observed at -6.76 m/yr in 89% of the coast between 1973 and 1988. The mean weighted linear regression rate of shoreline change was -2.39 + 7.05 m /yr from 1973 to 2018, the erosion being 83%. Besides, the sea level rise of 0.6 cm/year is expected to submerge 6983 ha of coastal resources, which includes mangroves, agriculture land, salt pans, and aquaculture farms from 82 villages in 2100. The expected inundation is likely to displace 20% of the human population in the region, including about 50,000 fishers. Government policies need to be developed in a people participatory and transparent mode to protect resources as well as livelihoods of the coastal communities.

TI  - The influence of assimilating leaf area index in a land surface model on global water fluxes and storages
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays a fundamental role not only in the energy and carbon cycles but also in the global water balance by controlling surface evapotranspiration (ET). Thus, accurately estimating vegetation-related variables has the potential to improve our understanding and estimation of the dynamic interactions between the water, energy, and carbon cycles. This study aims to assess the extent to which a land surface model (LSM) can be optimized through the assimilation of leaf area index (LAI) observations at the global scale. Two observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are performed to evaluate the efficiency of assimilating LAI into an LSM through an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to estimate LAI, ET, canopy-interception evaporation (CIE), canopy water storage (CWS), surface soil moisture (SSM), and terrestrial water storage (TWS). Results show that the LAI data assimilation framework not only effectively reduces errors in LAI model simulations but also improves all the modeled water flux and storage variables considered in this study (ET, CIE, CWS, SSM, and TWS), even when the forcing precipitation is strongly positively biased (extremely wet conditions). However, it tends to worsen some of the modeled water-related variables (SSM and TWS) when the forcing precipitation is affected by a dry bias. This is attributed to the fact that the amount of water in the LSM is conservative, and the LAI assimilation introduces more vegetation, which requires more water than what is available within the soil.

TI  - Application of remote sensing to identify Copper-Lead-Zinc deposits in the Heiqia area of the West Kunlun Mountains, Chinas
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The harsh natural environment and inaccessibility of the West Kunlun Mountains are barriers for their investigation via field geology. Remote sensing technology has the advantage of being efficient on a macroscale and not being restricted by terrain or road conditions in sparsely vegetated areas with exposed bedrock. This work focuses on copper-lead-zinc deposits in the Heiqia area in the West Kunlun Mountains as a case study to illustrate the application of IKONOS remote sensing images as major data sources to fabricate a standard image map, the extraction of information on ore-controlling factors and mineralization through the use of image enhancement methods, and the interpretation of remote sensing data to identify mineral resources. Alteration anomaly information was extracted from ASTER data, verified via field survey and sampling, and used to develop a remote sensing model for utilization in future prospecting efforts. The results of the survey showed that in IKONOS (band 3, 2, and 1 synthesis) images, the copper mineralization zone exhibits interlaced gray-white, blue-gray, and blue tones in a narrow strip-like pattern, while the lead-zinc mineralization zone shows gray-white, light gray-yellow, and yellowish-brown tones in a strip-like pattern. The main remotely sensed alteration anomalies are characteristic of hydroxyl. Six hydroxyl anomalies were delineated in the study area, of which five were found to be copper-lead-zinc deposits. The location of the ore bodies coincides well with the ASTER anomalies extracted. Two Cu-Pb-Zn mineralization belts are present in the study area. The ore-bearing rock series of belt No. I is phyllite interbedded with metasandstone, and the ore comprises mainly copper deposits supplemented by lead-zinc deposits. Belt No. II is in limestone and consists mainly of lead-zinc deposits supplemented by copper deposits. A remote sensing geological prospecting model for structurally altered Wenquangou Group copper-lead-zinc deposits with a genesis related to hot water basins is established. This provides a basis for future prospecting for similar minerals in the West Kunlun metallogenic belt.

TI  - Impact of continuous low water stage on the breeding environment of <i>Oncomelania hupensis</i>: a case study of Poyang Lake area in China
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundOncomelania hupensis is the only intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum and plays a decisive role in its transmission. The variation of water level greatly affects the reproduction and growth of snails. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the variations of water level in the Poyang Lake region from 1993 to 2016 combined with satellite imagery to elucidate the evolution of the snail breeding environment.MethodsBy employing remote sensing data from 1993 to 2016 (April-June and September-November), the vegetation area of Poyang Lake and the vegetation area at different elevations were extracted and calculated. Moreover, the average daily water level data from the four hydrological stations (Hukou station, Xingzi station, Tangyin station and Kangshan station) which represent the typical state of Poyang Lake were collected from 1993 to 2016. The variance of the monthly mean water level, inundation time and the average area were analyzed by variance to find a significance level of alpha =0.05.ResultsAccording to hydrological data before and after 2003, the average water level after 2003 is significantly lower than that before 2003 in Poyang Lake. After 2003, the time of inundateing the snail breeding period was later in April to June than that before 2003, while the time of wate-falling stage in September to November moved forward after 2003 than before 2003. Of them, the lowest water level affecting the breeding and growing period of O. hupensis in the northern part of Poyang Lake decreased from 11m to 9m. After 2003, the expansion of meadow area in the north part of Poyang Lake was mainly concentrated in the elevation of 9-11m, and the newly increased infested-meadow in the lake area was mainly concentrated in the north part of Poyang Lake.ConclusionsBy comparing the change of water level characteristics in different parts of the Poyang Lake area as well as changes in meadow area before and after 2003, it is found that the water level changes mainly affect the snail breeding area in the northern part of Poyang Lake. The results are helpful for improving scientific measures for snail control in Jiangxi Province. This approach could also be applicible to Dongting Lake area and other lake areas affected by water level changes and can bring significant guidance for snail control in lake areas.

TI  - Evaluating the effect of plain afforestation project and future spatial suitability in Beijing
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking the "One Million-Mu (666 km(2))" Plain Afforestation (Phase I) Project (Phase I afforestation) in Beijing city as an example, we monitored the growth status of planted forest using long-term remote sensing images, and evaluated the impacts of afforestation on land use change and vegetation growth. We found there is a large space for improvement regarding the ecological benefits of the project. Moreover, we found forest patches with decreasing greenness after the afforestation were mainly converted from farmland with high greenness and low heterogeneity in terms of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This implies that those farmland patches are inappropriate for afforestation. According to the results from Phase I afforestation and the impact of urbanization on green space, we constructed a series of spatial variables and generated a suitability map for the next "New Round of One Million-Mu (666 km(2)) Afforestation project" (Phase II afforestation). We then modeled the spatial distribution of Phase II afforestation based on the derived suitability map. This study is crucial for the scientific evaluation of afforestation projects for space planning (e.g., urban green space planning). The evaluation and modeling framework built in this study can be used to support the decision making and policy implementation of afforestation projects in China.

TI  - Axillary Management in Women with Early Breast Cancer and Limited Sentinel Node Metastasis: A Systematic Review and Metaanalysis of Real-World Evidence in the Post-ACOSOG Z0011 Era
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background After the publication of the Z0011 trial, the American Society of Clinical Oncology published an updated clinical practice guideline stating that clinicians should not recommend axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for early-stage breast cancer patients with the involvement of one or two sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). However, these recommendations have been challenged because they were mainly based on data from limited studies. The aim of the current study is to systematically compare the real-world outcomes of SLN biopsy (SLNB) alone and SLNB + ALND in patients with early-stage breast cancers and limited positive SLN metastasis in the post-Z0011 eraPatients and Methods We searched articles in the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The secondary endpoints were recurrence rate and the incidence of lymphedema.Results One randomized controlled trial and six retrospective studies with 8864 patients were retrieved. For patients with early-stage breast cancer with one or two SLN metastases, receiving SLNB alone showed no significant difference in OS, DFS, and recurrence rate compared with receiving SLNB + ALND. The incidence of lymphedema in patients who received SLNB alone was significantly lower than those who received SLNB + ALND (odds ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval 1.02-3.71).Conclusions Current real-world evidence proved that the Z0011 strategy is safe with respect to survival outcomes and effective in reducing the incidence of lymphedema. ALND should be avoided in patients with early-stage breast cancer with one or two SLN metastases in the post-Z0011 era.

TI  - Detection of World War II field fortifications using ALS and archival aerial images - German OKH Stellung b1 trenches in the south of the Polish Carpathians
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article recreates the spatial distribution of German field fortifications in the mountains of Central Europe. The fortifications in question were located in the southern part of the Polish Carpathians. This particular section is a fragment of theOberkommando des Heeres Stellung b1(OKH Stellung b1), built in 1944, and running from north to south through all of German-occupied Poland. Determining the course of the studied fortifications is based on the use of two remote sensing materials for data acquisition: archival military aerial photographs taken in 1944 and high-resolution terrain derivative models based on data from airborne laser scanning (ALS). Some sections were additionally checked during the field study. Creating a reconstruction is impossible without the use of both remote sensing data sources. Only 24% of the studied fortifications are visible in both the aerial photographs and the ALS model. Aerial photographs are better suited to the photointerpretation of trenches in arable land and near buildings. Objects in these places may have been buried or otherwise ceased to be visible as relief microforms. The ALS model is especially useful in wooded areas. Laser scanning with a large number of measurements enabled the implementation of a detailed model which also included the course of trenches under the tree canopy. Combining both source materials gave a spatial image of approximately a 30 km section of the fortified line. The total length of the fortifications was 85.412 km. The reconstructed line consists of two parallel trench lines with excavations for machine gun nests and shelters, as well as isolated points of defence located in the mountains near the current border.

TI  - The Epistemic Benefits of Worldview Disagreement
T2  - SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In my recent book,The Epistemic Benefits of Disagreement, I develop a defense of non-conciliationism, but one that only applies in research contexts: Epistemic benefits are more likely in the offing if inquirers stick to their guns in the face of disagreement. I aim to expand my original account by examining its implications for non-inquiry beliefs. I'm particularly interested in broader worldview disagreements. I want to examine how inquirers should react upon discovering that they disagree about the truth value of a particular proposition because they disagree about a whole host of related propositions. I argue that in many ways, worldview disagreements are easier to work with than disagreement over isolated propositions, in part because it is easier to provide a set of criteria by which to evaluate worldviews. I conclude that my original argument can, at least in part, be successfully expanded to include worldview disagreement.

TI  - Clinical signs predictive of influenza virus infection in Cameroon
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza virus accounts for majority of respiratory virus infections in Cameroon. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), influenza-like illnesses (ILI) are identified by a measured temperature of >= 38 degrees C and cough, with onset within the past 10 days. Other symptoms could as well be observed however, none of these are specific to influenza alone. This study aimed to determine symptom based predictors of influenza virus infection in Cameroon. Individuals with ILI were recruited from 2009-2018 in sentinel sites of the influenza surveillance system in Cameroon according to the WHO case definition. Individual data collection forms accompanied each respiratory sample and contained clinical data. Samples were analyzed for influenza using the gold standard assay. Two statistical methods were compared to determine the most reliable clinical predictors of influenza virus activity in Cameroon: binomial logistic predictive model and random forest model. Analyses were performed in R version 3.5.2. A total of 11816 participants were recruited, of which, 24.0% were positive for influenza virus. Binomial logistic predictive model revealed that the presence of cough, rhinorrhoea, headache and myalgia are significant predictors of influenza positivity. The prediction model had a sensitivity of 75.6%, specificity of 46.6% and AUC of 66.7%. The random forest model categorized the reported symptoms according to their degree of importance in predicting influenza virus infection. Myalgia had a 2-fold higher value in predicting influenza virus infection compared to any other symptom followed by arthralgia, head ache, rhinorrhoea and sore throat. The model had a OOB error rate of 25.86%. Analysis showed that the random forest model had a better performance over the binomial regression model in predicting influenza infection. Rhinorrhoea, headache and myalgia were symptoms reported by both models as significant predictors of influenza infection in Cameroon. These symptoms could be used by clinicians in their decision to treat patients.

TI  - Surgery for Men with Breast Cancer: Do the Same Data Still Apply?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Men represent a small proportion of breast cancer diagnoses, and they are often excluded from clinical trials. Current treatments are largely extrapolated from evidence in women. We compare practice patterns between men and women with breast cancer following the publication of several landmark clinical trials in surgery.Patients and Methods Patients with invasive breast cancer (2004-2015) from the National Cancer Data Base were identified; subcohorts were created based on eligibility for NSABP-B06, CALGB 9343, and ACOSOG Z0011. Practice patterns were stratified by gender and compared. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were utilized to estimate the association between OS and gender.Results Of the 1,664,746 patients identified, 99% were women and 1% were men. Among NSABP-B06 eligible men, mastectomy rates did not change (consistently similar to 80%), and their adjusted OS was minimally worse compared with women (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.11-1.28). Following publication of CALGB 9343, omission of radiation after lumpectomy was less likely in men and lagged behind that of women, despite similar OS (male HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.59-1.44). Application of ACOSOG Z0011 findings resulted in deescalation of axillary surgery for men and women with comparable OS (male HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33-1.45).Conclusions Uptake of clinical trial results for men with breast cancer often mirrors that for women, despite exclusion from these studies. Furthermore, when study findings were applied to eligible patients, men and women demonstrated similar survival. Observational studies can help inform the potential application of study findings to this unique population and improve patient enrollment in clinical trials.

TI  - Assessment of reference evapotranspiration across an arid urban environment having poor data monitoring system
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) in urban areas is challenging but essential in arid urban climates. To evaluate ET(0)in an urban environment and non-urban areas, air temperature and relative humidity were measured at five different sites across the arid city of Isfahan, Iran, over 4 years. Wind speed and sunshine hours were obtained from an urban surrounding weather station over the same period and used to estimate ET0. Calculated ET(0)was compared with satellite-based ET(0)retrieved from the MOD16A2 PET product. Although MODIS PET was strongly correlated with the Valiantzas equation, it overestimated ET(0)and showed average accuracy (r= 0.93-0.94,RMSE= 1.18-1.28 mm/day,MBE= 0.73-0.84 mm/day). The highest ET(0)differences between an urban green space and a non-urban area were 1.1 and 0.87 mm/day, which were estimated by ground measurements and MODIS PET, respectively. The sensitivity of ET(0)to wind speed and sunshine hours indicated a significant effect on cumulative ET(0)at urban sites compared to the non-urban site, which has a considerable impact on the amount of irrigation required in those areas. Although MODIS PET requires improvement to accurately reflect field level microclimate conditions affecting ET0, it is beneficial to hydrological applications and water resource managers especially in areas where data is limited. In addition, our results indicated that using limited data methods or meteorological data from regional weather stations, leads to incorrect estimation of ET(0)in urban areas. Therefore, decision-makers and urban planners should consider the importance of precisely estimating ET(0)to optimize management of urban green space irrigation, especially in arid and semi-arid climates such as the city of Isfahan.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The instability situation affecting the Middle East poses threats to preservation of cultural heritage. Mapping efforts based on satellite imagery currently concentrate more on recording human-induced damage than impacts of unforeseen natural events (e.g. floods). In 2018, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Bosra and the landscape of Sergiopolis-Resafa in Syria were flooded after heavy rainfall. While the first incident was reported by heritage organisations (although information was limited to the main monument), the second event was completely unknown. Using optical and radar satellite images from the European Commission's Copernicus Sentinels fleet and the Italian Space Agency's COSMO-SkyMed constellation, we prove that these data are an enormous reservoir of information to assess comprehensively the duration, extent and severity of such natural events. In Bosra, several key assets were flooded besides the Roman Theatre, with waters taking from few days to several weeks to evacuate and dry out. In Sergiopolis, while the main ruins were sheltered by the fortification walls, the nearby floodplain was inundated. The floodwater-flow pattern resembled the simulations developed by archaeologists to prove the existence of an ancient system of embankments and dam. Our results suggest that many other events posing risk to heritage assets, otherwise unnoticed, may be unveiled if current satellite imagery archives, yet to analyse, are systematically screened.

TI  - Big ideas in education: Quantum mechanics and education paradigms
T2  - EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current education paradigms were informed by the classical Newtonian worldview of brain functioning in which the mind is simply the physical activity of the brain, and our thoughts cannot have any effect upon the physical world. However, researchers in the field of quantum mechanics found that the outcomes of certain subatomic experiments are determined by the consciousness of the observer, leading philosophers to propose that the observed and the observer are linked. Quantum mechanics also demonstrates that distant minds may behave in simultaneous correlational ways, in the absence of being linked through any known energetic signal. Further, researchers in this field propose that an external memory space is operating in the human brain, suggesting that this proposed external memory space may be a quantum field surrounding the brain and interacting with other fields, generating a global mental field of information flow. This article proposes that current education paradigms, which have been informed by a classical Newtonian physics worldview may need to be expanded to include a quantum mechanics worldview. The author seeks to understand if, and how, quantum mechanics could inform education practices, theories and paradigms and invites discussion, debate and speculation on the implications this would have for education systems.

TI  - Ribosome Collisions Trigger General Stress Responses to Regulate Cell Fate
T2  - CELL
M3  - Article
AB  - Problems arising during translation of mRNAs lead to ribosome stalling and collisions that trigger a series of quality control events. However, the global cellular response to ribosome collisions has not been explored. Here, we uncover a function for ribosome collisions in signal transduction. Using translation elongation inhibitors and general cellular stress conditions, including amino acid starvation and UV irradiation, we show that ribosome collisions activate the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and GCN2-mediated stress response pathways. We show that the MAPKKK ZAK functions as the sentinel for ribosome collisions and is required for immediate early activation of both SAPK (p38/JNK) and GCN2 signaling pathways. Selective ribosome profiling and biochemistry demonstrate that although ZAK generally associates with elongating ribosomes on polysomal mRNAs, it specifically auto-phosphorylates on the minimal unit of colliding ribosomes, the disome. Together, these results provide molecular insights into how perturbation of translational homeostasis regulates cell fate.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Supra-glacial debris cover is key to glacier ablation through increasing (thin debris layer) or decreasing (thick debris layer) melt rates, thereby regulating the mass balance of a glacier and its meltwater runoff. The thickening or lateral expansion of supra-glacial debris cover correlates with a reduction of glacier ablation and, consequently, runoff generation, which is also considered to be an influential factor on the rheology and dynamics of a glacierized system. Studies on supra-glacial debris cover have recently attracted wide attention especially for glaciers in the Himalayas and Karakoram, where the glaciers have heterogeneously responded to climate change. In this study, we used 32 images from the Landsat Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Operational Land Imager archive, going back to 1990, which are available on the Google Earth Engine cloud-computing platform, to map the supra-glacial debris cover in the Hunza Valley, Karakoram, Pakistan, based on a band ratio segmentation method (normalized difference snow index [NDSI] < 0.4), Otsu thresholding, and machine learning algorithms. Compared with manual digitization, the random forest (RF) model was found to have the greatest accuracy in identifying supra-glacial debris, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.94 +/- 0.01 and an overall accuracy of 95.5 +/- 0.9%. Overall, the supra-glacial debris cover in the study area showed an increasing trend, and the total area expanded by 8.1-21.3% for various glaciers from 1990 to 2019. The other two methods (Otsu thresholding and NDSI < 0.4) generally overestimated the supra-glacial debris covered area, by 36.3 and 18.8%, respectively, compared to that of the RF model. The supra-glacial debris cover has migrated upward on the glaciers, with intensive variation near the equilibrium-line altitude zone (4,500-5,500 m a.s.l.). The increase in ice or snow avalanche activity at high altitudes may be responsible for this upward expansion of supra-glacial debris cover in the Hunza Valley, which is attributed to the combined effect of temperature decrease and precipitation increase in the study area.

TI  - Histamine 2/3 receptor agonists alleviate perioperative neurocognitive disorders by inhibiting microglia activation through the PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 pathway in aged rats
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Microglia, the principal sentinel immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), play an extensively vital role in neuroinflammation and perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND). Histamine, a potent mediator of inflammation, can both promote and prevent microglia-related neuroinflammation by activating different histamine receptors. Rat microglia express four histamine receptors (H1R, H2R, H3R, and H4R), among which the histamine 1 and 4 receptors can promote microglia activation, whereas the role and cellular mechanism of the histamine 2 and 3 receptors have not been elucidated. Therefore, we evaluated the effects and potential cellular mechanisms of histamine 2/3 receptors in microglia-mediated inflammation and PND. Methods This study investigated the role of histamine 2/3 receptors in microglia-induced inflammation and PND both in vivo and in vitro. In the in vivo experiments, rats were injected with histamine 2/3 receptor agonists in the right lateral ventricle and were then subjected to exploratory laparotomy. In the in vitro experiments, primary microglia were pretreated with histamine 2/3 receptor agonists before stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cognitive function, microglia activation, proinflammatory cytokine production, NF-kappa b expression, M1/M2 phenotypes, cell migration, and Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) expression were assessed. Results In our study, the histamine 2/3 receptor agonists inhibited exploratory laparotomy- or LPS-induced cognitive decline, microglia activation, proinflammatory cytokine production, NF-kappa b expression, M1/M2 phenotype transformation, cell migration, and TLR4 expression through the PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 pathway. Conclusion Based on our findings, we conclude that histamine 2/3 receptors ameliorate PND by inhibiting microglia activation through the PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 pathway. Our results highlight histamine 2/3 receptors as potential therapeutic targets to treat neurological conditions associated with PND.

TI  - Bellwether sites for evaluating changes in landslide frequency and magnitude in cryospheric mountainous terrain: a call for systematic, long-term observations to decipher the impact of climate change
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Review
AB  - Permafrost and glaciers are being degraded by the warming effects of climate change. The impact that this degradation has on slope stability in mountainous terrain is the subject of ongoing research efforts. The relatively new availability of high-resolution (<= 10 m) imagery with worldwide coverage and short (<= 30 days) repeat acquisition times, as well as the emerging field of environmental seismology, presents opportunities for making remote, systematic observations of landslides in cryospheric mountainous terrain. I reviewed the literature and evaluated landslide activity in existing imagery to select five similar to 5000-km(2)sites where long-term, systematic observations could take place. The five proposed sites are the northern and eastern flanks of the Northern Patagonia Ice Field, the Western European Alps, the eastern Karakoram Range in the Himalayan Mountains, the Southern Alps of New Zealand, and the Fairweather Range in Southeast Alaska. Systematic observations of landslide occurrence, triggers, size, and travel distance at these sites, especially if coupled with observations from in situ instrumental monitoring, could lead to a better understanding of changes in slope stability induced by climate change. The suggested sites are not meant to be absolute and unalterable. Rather, they are intended as a starting point and discussion starter for new work in this expanding landslide research frontier.

T2  - CANCER INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate if there was an association between intraoperative NSAID use and recurrence or survival. A cohort of patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy for the treatment of cutaneous melanoma was retrospectively recruited. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 516 were included (NSAIDs = 307). The 10-year melanoma-specific survival was 63.2%. Log-rank test showed no statistically significant differences in time to treatment failure, melanoma-specific survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival between the study groups. The current study did not support the use of intraoperative NSAIDs in preventing death or recurrence in patients with melanoma.

TI  - Lateral meltwater transfer across an Antarctic ice shelf
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface meltwater on ice shelves can exist as slush, it can pond in lakes or crevasses, or it can flow in surface streams and rivers. The collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf in 2002 has been attributed to the sudden drainage of similar to 3000 surface lakes and has highlighted the potential for surface water to cause ice-shelf instability. Surface meltwater systems have been identified across numerous Antarctic ice shelves, although the extent to which these systems impact ice-shelf instability is poorly constrained. To better understand the role of surface meltwater systems on ice shelves, it is important to track their seasonal development, monitoring the fluctuations in surface water volume and the transfer of water across ice-shelf surfaces. Here, we use Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery to track surface meltwater across the Nivlisen Ice Shelf in the 2016-2017 melt season. We develop the Fully Automated Supraglacial-Water Tracking algorithm for Ice Shelves (FASTISh) and use it to identify and track the development of 1598 water bodies, which we classify as either circular or linear. The total volume of surface meltwater peaks on 26 January 2017 at 5.5 x 10(7) m(3). At this time, 63 % of the total volume is held within two linear surface meltwater systems, which are up to 27 km long, are orientated along the ice shelf's north-south axis, and follow the surface slope. Over the course of the melt season, they appear to migrate away from the grounding line, while growing in size and enveloping smaller water bodies. This suggests there is large-scale lateral water transfer through the surface meltwater system and the firn pack towards the ice-shelf front during the summer.

TI  - Climate variability and its effect on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using remote sensing in semi-arid area
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semi areas, understanding the impact of climate variability on vegetation is a key to managing a new adaptation strategy and safeguarding crop production. The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and rainfall (R) in the arid area of Gabes. The relationship analysis was carried out in three phases: Firstly, NDVI and LST were derived from Landsat TM (1987,1995), Landsat ETM + (2003) and Landsat 8 Oli/TIRS (2015) using GIS and remote-sensing tools. Then, the trend of LST has been analyzed according to on the obtained map. The rainfall data was homogenized over 10 stations rainfall from 1974 to 2015 using the Regional Vector Method and the variability. It was analyzed using the graphical chronological method in information processing (MGCTI) and tests for rupture detection. Finally, the response of vegetation to climatic parameters was portrayed using zonal statistics. Results show a decrease in rainfall and an increase in LST on 100% of the area. On an annual scale, linear regression reported a positive relation between NDVI and rainfall, while this relation was has been negative between LST and NDVI. Thus, during the study period, the vegetation growth decreased by about 70% in response to the observed climatic variation. The findings show that vegetation growth is affected by rainfall and also by LST. Accordingly, the backup strategy should be based on irrigation management measures monitored by the control of LST.

TI  - The impact of river regulation in the Tigris and Euphrates on the Arvandroud Estuary
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arvandroud river (also known as Shatt-al-Arab) and its estuary have been degraded due to the changing river flow regime in the Tigris and Euphrates. This study assessed changes in flow from the major rivers and the impacts on the estuary. To assess the river flow changes, three major flow regime attributes were computed: timing (TIF), magnitude (MIF), and variability (VIF). By combining these indices, the total flow regime impact factor (IF) was scaled between 0 and 1, and classified into five groups: Low (0.80<IF<1.0), Incipient (0.60<IF<0.80), Moderate (0.40<IF<0.60), Severe (0.2<IF<0.40), and Drastic (0.0<IF<0.20). Flow regime impact maps were then created for 1941-1955, 1960-1970, 1975-1984, and 1990-2000. These revealed that, over time, the impact has extended along the basin from downstream to upstream, with a significant flow regime change from 1941-1955 to 1990-2000 in the Tigris, Euphrates, and Arvandroud. Analysis of remote sensing data revealed that the change in the flow regime has led to land degradation in the Arvandroud estuary during the past 46 years (1972-2018). In addition, the impact of the Iran-Iraq war (based on degradation of vegetation cover between 1985 and 1988) is 5.1 times of mean rate of change during 1972-2018. This study thus contributes new information on estuaries and the impact of upstream land and water use change.

M3  - Article
AB  - The handling and reporting of resected lymph nodes in gynecologic cancer follows the recommendations of the German national guidelines and the recommendations of the International Collaboration of Cancer Reporting (ICCR) and the International Society of Gynecologic Pathologists (ISGyP). The definitions of micrometastases and isolated tumor cells are in accordance with the definition of the UICC (Union Internationale Contre le Cancer) and TNM system. Both findings must be reported as part of the pathology report and final tumor classification. It is mandatory to examine all excised lymph nodes with complete processing of all nodes up to 0.3 & x202f;cm and slicing of all larger nodes in 0.2-cm wide intervals with complete processing of all lamellae. The amount of the resected lymph nodes in correlation to positive nodes, the metric dimension of the largest lymph node metastasis per lymph node region, and the presence of extracapsular extension of the lymph node deposits must be part of the pathology report. The handling and cutting of sentinel lymph nodes are similar to nonsentinel nodes. Within frozen section analyses and final processing from paraffin-embedded sentinel nodes, all nodes should be examined by three-step sections with an interval of about 200 & x202f;mu m. In cases of negative sentinel nodes on H&E staining, immunohistochemical ultrastaging should be performed.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires cause a lot of damage in Turkey, due to the geographical location, high temperatures, and low humidity levels. Accurate determination of burned forest areas is crucial for correct damage assessment studies, fire risk calculations, and review of the forest regeneration processes. In this study, we compare the performances of unsupervised classification methods (which have not been used to map burned areas before) of burned area extraction from medium resolution satellite images with K-means. In this regard, the areas affected by fire in the Kumluca and Adrasan regions in 2016, Alanya and Gumuldur regions in 2017 and Athens region in 2018 are determined using Landsat 8 images. For this purpose, Canopy, M-tree, a hierarchical clustering algorithm, and a learning vector quantization which are frequently used in the literature are applied to determine the burned area, and the results obtained are compared with the results obtained from K-means. The results show that unsupervised classification methods can be used to map burned areas. The hierarchical clustering and K-means algorithms provide the most accurate results in mapping burned areas in most of the regions used in the study.

TI  - Evaluating the influencing factors of urbanization in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region over the past 27 years based on VIIRS-DNB and DMSP/OLS nightlight imageries
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is the core economic area of the "Silk Road Economic Belt". The urbanization of this region plays a highly important role in economic and cultural communications between China, Central Asia and Europe. However, the influencing factors of urbanization in this region remain unclear. In this study, we presented a new modified thresholding method to extract the urban built-up areas from two nightlight remote sensing data sources,i.e., the DMSP/OLS and VIIRS/DNB nightlight imageries. Then, geographical detectors and hierarchical partitioning analysis were used to test the influences of anthropogenic and geographic environmental factors on urbanization. Our results showed that the relative error between the actual and the extracted urban built-up areas calculated using our method ranged from -0.30 to 0.27 in two biggest sample cities (Urumqi and Karamay) over the last 27 years. These errors were lower than those calculated by using the traditional method (-0.66 <= relative error <= -0.11). The expansion of urban built-up areas was greater in the northern regions than the southern regions of Xinjiang, as well as was greater in large cities than small and medium-sized cities. The influence of anthropogenic factors on urbanization has continually decreased over the past 27 years, while the influence of geographical environmental factors has increased. Among all influencing factors, fixed asset investment, topographic position index and per capita possession of water resources have the high contributions on urbanization, accounting for 18.75%, 15.62% and 14.18% of the variance of urbanization, respectively. Here, we provided a new method for studying urbanization by using remote sensing data. Our results are helpful for understand the driving factors of urbanization, and they provide guidance for the sustainable economic development of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

TI  - Reviewing global estimates of surface reactive nitrogen concentration and deposition using satellite retrievals
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Since the industrial revolution, human activities have dramatically changed the nitrogen (N) cycle in natural systems. Anthropogenic emissions of reactive nitrogen (N-r) can return to the earth's surface through atmospheric N-r deposition. Increased N-r deposition may improve ecosystem productivity. However, excessive N-r deposition can cause a series of negative effects on ecosystem health, biodiversity, soil, and water. Thus, accurate estimations of N-r deposition are necessary for evaluating its environmental impacts. The United States, Canada and Europe have successively launched a number of satellites with sensors that allow retrieval of atmospheric NO2 and NH3 column density and therefore estimation of surface N-r concentration and deposition at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Atmosphere NH3 column can be retrieved from atmospheric infra-red emission, while atmospheric NO2 column can be retrieved from reflected solar radiation. In recent years, scientists attempted to estimate surface N-r concentration and deposition using satellite retrieval of atmospheric NO2 and NH3 columns. In this study, we give a thorough review of recent advances of estimating surface N-r concentration and deposition using the satellite retrievals of NO2 and NH3, present a framework of using satellite data to estimate surface N-r concentration and deposition based on recent works, and summarize the existing challenges for estimating surface N-r concentration and deposition using the satellite-based methods. We believe that exploiting satellite data to estimate N-r deposition has a broad and promising prospect.

TI  - Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Component-separated maps of CMB temperature and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW D
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimal analyses of many signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) require map-level extraction of individual components in the microwave sky, rather than measurements at the power spectrum level alone. To date, nearly all map-level component separation in CMB analyses has been performed exclusively using satellite data. In this paper, we implement a component separation method based on the internal linear combination (ILC) approach which we have designed to optimally account for the anisotropic noise (in the 2D Fourier domain) often found in ground-based CMB experiments. Using this method, we combine multifrequency data from the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter (ACTPol) to construct the first wide-area (approximate to 2100 sq. deg.), arcminute-resolution component-separated maps of the CMB temperature anisotropy and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect sourced by the inverse-Compton scattering of CMB photons off hot, ionized gas. Our ILC pipeline allows for explicit deprojection of various contaminating signals, including a modified blackbody approximation of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) spectral energy distribution. The cleaned CMB maps will be a useful resource for CMB lensing reconstruction, kinematic SZ cross-correlations, and primordial nonGaussianity studies. The tSZ maps will be used to study the pressure profiles of galaxies, groups, and clusters through cross-correlations with halo catalogs, with dust contamination controlled via CIB deprojection. The data products described in this paper are available on LAMBDA.

AB  - Background: The increasing availability of electronic healthcare data offers an opportunity to enhance adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) signal monitoring in near real-time.Aim: To evaluate the potential use of telephone helpline data to augment the existing AEFI surveillance system in Victoria, Australia.Methods: Anonymised telephone helpline call data were extracted between 2009 and 2017. For comparison, we included AEFI reports to the Victorian enhanced passive surveillance system, SAEFVIC "Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination In the Community". The temporal pattern cross-correlation coefficient at different time lags was estimated as a measure of timeliness evaluation. Historically known AEFI signals in 2010 and 2015 were examined using the Farrington statistical signal detection algorithm.Result: During the study period, overall, the telephone helpline centre received 2,005,226 calls. Of these, 0.68% (13,719) were AEFI-related. In the same period, SAEFVIC received 10,367 AEFI related reports. Cross-correlation analysis, generally, showed that the two datasets were moderately correlated (r = 0.4) at a negative lag of 1 week. For individual years, the cross-correlation coefficient was highest (r = 0.66) in 2010 with the telephone helpline data leading by 2 weeks. Our analysis indicated the 2010 reported incidence of febrile convulsions and the 2015 reported increased allergic-related reactions following seasonal influenza vaccination three weeks and one week earlier respectively.Conclusion: Telephone helpline data was able to detect an increased rate of AEFI earlier than the enhanced passive AEFI surveillance system. This dataset offers a valuable and near real-time component of an integrated AEFI early signal detection system in Australia. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Service quality in multichannel fashion retailing: an exploratory study
T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Consumer purchasing behaviour has changed substantially in the light of recent developments in E-commerce. So-called "multichannel customers" tend to switch retail channels during the purchasing process. In order to address changing consumer behaviour, multichannel fashion retailing companies must continue to learn how to provide excellent service to such customers. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the interpretation of multichannel service quality by explaining it from the perspective of the so-called "multichannel customers". Design/methodology/approach Drawing on social influence theory, this paper aims to investigate these issues from the perspective of multichannel customers. In contrast with dualist and objectivist studies, this paper uses a constructivist epistemology and ethnographic methodology. Such an approach is associated with an interpretivist ontological worldview, which postulates the existence of "multiple realities". The sample size for this research consisted of 34 in-depth interviews and 2 focus groups comprising 10 focus group participants. Findings The data analysis fundamentally found that multichannel customers tended to continually adjust choices regarding retailer and retail ckhannel when making purchases. The perspective of this paper is different from mainstream positivist service quality research which sees service quality as static, objectively measurable and dualistic. As an alternative, this paper acknowledges service quality as a dynamic, subjective and pluralistic phenomenon. Originality/value This paper contributes to the interpretation of multichannel service quality with a new concept that explains the phenomenon from the perspective of customers and thus considers it necessary for multichannel retailers to adopt strategies relating to customers' changing behaviour.

TI  - COVID-19 Pandemic and City-Level Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) Reduction for Urban Centres of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution poses a grave health risk and is a matter of concern for researchers around the globe. Toxic pollutants like nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a result of industrial and transport sector emissions and need to be analysed at the current scenario. After the world realised the effect of COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the globe proposed complete lockdown to contain the spread. The present research focuses on analysing the gaseous pollution scenarios, before and during lockdown through satellite (Sentinel-5P data sets) and ground-based measurements (Central Pollution Control Board's Air Quality Index, AQI) for 8 five-million plus cities in India (Delhi, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Bengaluru and Pune). The long-term exposure to NO(2)was also linked to pandemic-related mortality cases across the country. An average of 46% reduction in average NO(2)values and 27% improvement in AQI was observed in the eight cities during the first lockdown phase with respect to pre-lockdown phase. Also, 53% of Corona positive cases and 61% of fatality cases were observed in the eight major cities of the country alone, coinciding with locations having high long-term NO(2)exposure.

TI  - Low-trauma ankle fractures in Brazil: secular trends in patients over 50 years old from 2004 to 2013
T2  - ARCHIVES OF OSTEOPOROSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The most common sites of low-energy trauma fractures are the femur, vertebra, humerus, and forearm. Ankle fractures have significant morbidity and high costs for surgical procedure. Forearm fractures are common nonvertebral fractures. Forearm fractures are classified as fragility fractures and predictive for fractures at other sites, although do not allow osteoporosis diagnosis. It is controversial whether ankle fractures are osteoporosis fractures. Methods Retrospective observational study, with secular trend analysis, in patients over 50 years old admitted in the Brazilian Public Health System, from 2004 to 2013. We collected hospitalization data according to the ICD-10 for low-trauma ankle and forearm fractures. Fracture rate was calculated according to gender, age, and geographic region, performed linear regression analysis, and estimated fracture rates for 2030. Comparison of ankle and forearm rates was also performed, grouping them in 3-year block. ANOVA test was used to compare each block. Results Ankle fracture rate was 21.39 fractures per 100,000 inhabitants, 23.98 in females and 18.49 in males. Fracture rates were higher in the South and Southeast regions. In absolute numbers, although ankle fracture rate increased with age, there was a significant decrease in the population over 80 years old. Data showed stabilization in ankle fractures from 2004 to 2013, in women and men. In 3-year block analysis, men had higher ankle fracture rates than forearm. However, in women, forearm rates were higher than ankle. Conclusion Our data suggest that ankle fractures in men would be considered as a sentinel fracture with a similar clinical impact of forearm fracture.

TI  - Temporal interpolation of land surface fluxes derived from remote sensing - results with an unmanned aerial system
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing imagery can provide snapshots of rapidly changing land surface variables, e.g. evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (T-s), net radiation (R-n), soil moisture (theta), and gross primary productivity (GPP), for the time of sensor overpass. However, discontinuous data acquisitions limit the applicability of remote sensing for water resources and ecosystem management. Methods to interpolate between remote sensing snapshot data and to upscale them from an instantaneous to a daily timescale are needed. We developed a dynamic soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer model to interpolate land surface state variables that change rapidly between remote sensing observations. The "Soil-Vegetation, Energy, water, and CO2 traNsfer" (SVEN) model, which combines the snapshot version of the remote sensing Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory ET model and light use efficiency GPP models, now incorporates a dynamic component for the ground heat flux based on the "force-restore" method and a water balance "bucket" model to estimate theta and canopy wetness at a half-hourly time step. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the method using optical and thermal data from an unmanned aerial system at a willow plantation flux site (Risoe, Denmark). Based on model parameter calibration with the snapshots of land surface variables at the time of flight, SVEN interpolated UAS-based snapshots to continuous records of T-s, R-n, theta, ET, and GPP for the 2016 growing season with forcing from continuous climatic data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Validation with eddy covariance and other in situ observations indicates that SVEN can estimate daily land surface fluxes between remote sensing acquisitions with normalized root mean square deviations of the simulated daily T-s, R-n, theta, LE, and GPP of 11.77 %, 6.65 %, 19.53 %, 14.77 %, and 12.97 % respectively. In this deciduous tree plantation, this study demonstrates that temporally sparse optical and thermal remote sensing observations can be used to calibrate soil and vegetation parameters of a simple land surface modelling scheme to estimate "low-persistence" or rapidly changing land surface variables with the use of few forcing variables. This approach can also be applied with remotely-sensed data from other platforms to fill temporal gaps, e.g. cloud-induced data gaps in satellite observations.

TI  - Clinical significance of SLN benign capsular nevi in patients with melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Benign capsular nevi (BCN) are not infrequent in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) of patients with melanoma. Their prognostic significance is unknown and the literature is limited. This study evaluated the clinical significance of incidentally found BCN in these patients. Methods A multi-institutional retrospective review of patients undergoing SLN biopsy for cutaneous melanoma between 2000 and 2016. Patients were divided into the following groups: (a) negative SLN and no BCN, (b) negative SLN and presence of BCN, (c) positive SLN seen only on immunohistochemistry (IHC), and (d) positive SLN via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Outcomes measured were overall survival and any recurrence. Results A total of 1253 patients were identified (group 1 = 978, group 2 = 56, group 3 = 32, and group 4 = 187). Fifty-seven percent were male and the mean age was 59.3 years. BCN was identified in 77 patients (6.2%), of which the majority was in the node-negative group (72%). Multivariable analysis showed that BCN was associated with lower recurrence rates, though not statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.5;P = .06). IHC- and H&E-positive SLNs were associated with a higher risk of recurrence (HR = 2.4;P = .02 and 2.0,P < .0001, respectively). Conclusion Patients with BCN and negative SLN had lower recurrence rates than patients with negative SLN and no BCN. Our data suggest a possible protective effect against recurrence.

TI  - Characterizing the effects of climate change on short-term post-disturbance forest recovery in southern China from Landsat time-series observations (1988-2016)
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change, a recognized critical environmental issue, plays an important role in regulating the structure and function of forest ecosystems by altering forest disturbance and recovery regimes. This research focused on exploring the statistical relationships between meteorological and topographic variables and the recovery characteristics following disturbance of plantation forests in southern China. We used long-term Landsat images and the vegetation change tracker algorithm to map forest disturbance and recovery events in the study area from 1988 to 2016. Stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF) regression, and support vector machine (SVM) regression were used in conjunction with climate variables and topographic factors to model short-term forest recovery using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The results demonstrated that the regenerating forests were sensitive to the variation in temperature. The fitted results suggested that the relationship between theNDVIvalues of the forest areas and the post-disturbance climatic and topographic factors differed in regression algorithms. The RF regression yielded the best performance with an R(2)value of 0.7348 for the validation accuracy. This indicated that slope and temperature, especially high temperatures, had substantial effects on post-disturbance vegetation recovery in southern China. For other mid-subtropical monsoon regions with intense light and heat and abundant rainfall, the information will also contribute to appropriate decisions for forest managers on forest recovery measures. Additionally, it is essential to explore the relationships between forest recovery and climate change of different vegetation types or species for more accurate and targeted forest recovery strategies.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of axillary dissection on recurrence-free survival by extent of nodal disease in invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Clinical trials have shown that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be avoided for many breast cancer patients with limited nodal involvement. However, whether its omission is safe for those with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is still questioned. We sought to evaluate the impact of ALND on recurrence-free survival (RFS) by extent of nodal disease in patients with ILC. Methods We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of ILC patients treated between 1990 and 2019 at our institution. Patients underwent either breast conservation surgery (BCS) or mastectomy. We used univariate and multivariate statistics in Stata 14.2 to evaluate associations between extent of axillary surgery and time to recurrence stratified by nodal burden. Results Of 520 cases, 387 (78.4%) were node negative, 74 (14.9%) had 1-2 positive nodes, and 59 (11.4%) had three or more positive nodes. Most patients (93.3%) had hormone receptor-positive disease, and 94.8% had low or intermediate-grade tumors. The rate of ALND significantly decreased over time (p < 0.002). Using a multivariate model, there was no significant difference in RFS estimates based on receipt of ALND (HR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.17-1.64,p = 0.27), which also held true for patients with 1-2 positive nodes using a test of interaction (HR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.12-6.76,p = 0.92). Conclusions These findings support the safety of omitting ALND in selected patients with ILC. Further studies of axillary management in ILC and imaging tools to predict nodal involvement and therapeutic response are warranted.

AB  - Spatial features with spectral properties enhance the quality of satellite image while mapping complex land cover. These features are integrated with the proposed classification approach for improving classification results. The ultimate objective of this investigation is to provide high-level features to the convolutional neural network (CNN) for mapping flooded regions (before and after) using remote sensing data. Here, boundary-based segmentation is done to recognize the dimensions and scales of objects. Modeling a fully trained Convolutional network is feasible for training a huge amount of data in remote sensing studies. Fine-tuned CNN is utilized with slight modification for attaining classified Landsat images. Classification outcomes and confusion matrix are manipulated using B-CNN are compared with classifiers like SVM, random forest (RF) to compute B-CNN efficiency.

TI  - Impact of human intervention on assessing downstream channel behaviour of Ichamati River on the lower Gangetic Plain of West Bengal, India
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the period of human civilization, the hydrological and morphological characteristics of most of the rivers have been intensively modified by human interferences. In this context, the Ichamati River is one of the worst affected distributary channels flowing on the lower Gangetic delta of South Bengal. This tidally active river is streaming on the most densely inhabited district (North 24 Parganas) of West Bengal. The river is gradually decaying over time due to direct and indirect human activities on and along the river. Therefore, the prime aim of this research study is to explain the temporal change of the channel behaviour, especially fluvio-morphological characteristics of the river during 1976-2016. The present study also highlights location-specific causal factors liable for the downstream modification of the channel behaviour. In this research study, channel migration, erosion rate, bank vulnerability zone and channel planform pattern have been assessed using Landsat images of 1976, 1996 and 2016 in remote sensing and GIS environment. Besides, an intensive field survey was conducted for cross-sectional survey of the river. Primary data were gathered from brick kilns through a questionnaire survey for the estimation of sediment extraction rate from the river to prepare the sediment-water budget of the river. This study reveals that the morphological characteristics of Ichamati River have been modified at the human-nature interface and continuous siltation causes gradual upliftment of the riverbed. The channel is gradually narrowing and decaying over time. This study is helpful to understand the current status of the river and helps river scientists for its restoration as well as management planning.

TI  - Environmental dynamics of the Jurua watershed in the Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Jurua Watershed region, an important tributary of the Amazon River, lacks scientific information related to climate and environmental variables. In this sense, this study intends to analyze the environmental dynamics of the Jurua Watershed in the Amazon. We used monthly weather data derived from Reanalysis 2. The products fire foci, vegetation index and surface water index derived from the MODIS sensor for a monthly time series from 2001 to 2018. The ARIMA model was used to simulate future changes from NDFI. The lowest rainfall years of the series were 2005, 2010 and 2016 also observed for soil moisture in 2005 and 2016; the most rainfall years were 2009 and 2014, with the highest values of flooded areas in January, 23,772 km(2). The highest concentration of fire foci occurred in August and September, coinciding with the lowest NDFI values found (1421 km(2)and 890 km(2)), with the years 2005 and 2010 with highest fire foci. The EVI showed higher values from October to December with values close to 0.57, the lowest values in June and July (0.50). The years 2009 and 2015 showed largest flooded area records, 2005 and 2010 the lowest records. The PCA pointed out the rain as the variable of greatest influence in the basin with 0.98, followed by hot flashes with - 0.90. NDFI was highly correlated with rainfall and ARIMA modeling allowed the generation of a reliable future scenario and a significant downward trend in flooded areas by 2030.

TI  - Molecular and cellular cues governing nanomaterial-mucosae interactions: from nanomedicine to nanotoxicology
T2  - CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Mucosal tissues constitute the largest interface between the body and the surrounding environment and they regulate the access of molecules, supramolecular structures, particulate matter, and pathogens into it. All mucosae are characterized by an outer mucus layer that protects the underlying cells from physicochemical, biological and mechanical insults, a mono-layered or stratified epithelium that forms tight junctions and controls the selective transport of solutes across it and associated lymphoid tissues that play a sentinel role. Mucus is a gel-like material comprised mainly of the glycoprotein mucin and water and it displays both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, a net negative charge, and high porosity and pore interconnectivity, providing an efficient barrier for the absorption of therapeutic agents. To prolong the residence time, absorption and bioavailability of a broad spectrum of active compounds upon mucosal administration, mucus-penetrating and mucoadhesive particles have been designed by tuning the chemical composition, the size, the density, and the surface properties. The benefits of utilizing nanomaterials that interact intimately with mucosae by different mechanisms in the nanomedicine field have been extensively reported. To ensure the safety of these nanosystems, their compatibility is evaluatedin vitroandin vivoin preclinical and clinical trials. Conversely, there is a growing concern about the toxicity of nanomaterials dispersed in air and water effluents that unintentionally come into contact with the airways and the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, deep understanding of the key nanomaterial properties that govern the interplay with mucus and tissues is crucial for the rational design of more efficient drug delivery nanosystems (nanomedicine) and to anticipate the fate and side-effects of nanoparticulate matter upon acute or chronic exposure (nanotoxicology). This review initially overviews the complex structural features of mucosal tissues, including the structure of mucus, the epithelial barrier, the mucosal-associated lymphatic tissues and microbiota. Then, the most relevant investigations attempting to identify and validate the key particle features that govern nanomaterial-mucosa interactions and that are relevant in both nanomedicine and nanotoxicology are discussed in a holistic manner. Finally, the most popular experimental techniques and the incipient use of mathematical and computational models to characterize these interactions are described.

TI  - Agricultural Water Monitoring for Water Management Under Pivot Irrigation System Using Spatial Techniques
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semi-arid regions, the water-use efficiency (WUE) is highly important for water administration and management. The water losses increased, when water application records low efficiency. The water losses maybe amplified, when the irrigation system ignores soil variability and water applied uniformly. Which means more water application, more energy demand, and more money expenses. The current investigation aims at using remotely sensed data and GIS Techniques for monitoring irrigation water consumption and its correlation with crop yield under the pivot irrigation system. El-Salhia region contains a big agricultural farm located at the South Eastern of Nile delta. The investigated field was irrigated under the pivot central sprinkler irrigation system which cultivated with the wheat crop. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) were calculated based on landsat data. The crop water stress index (CWSI) depends on the variance between the LST of the targets and their air temperature (Tair) to detect the relative moisture condition. The soil texture, organic matter, time-domain reflectometer (TDR), thermal infrared, leaf area index (LAI), and actual yield measurements were taken for 47 systematic samples during the wheat growing season of the year 2012/2013. Accordingly, the available water (AW) displayed relatively lower accuracy than the rest of the other parameters. The canopy temperature (T-c), CWSI, field capacity (Fc), and LAI showed high accuracy to predict the wheat yield as shown from the statistical analysis. The WUE recorded 1.07 (kg/m(3)) in the southeast boundary and gradient toward the northwest boundary with a rate of 2.2 (kg/m(3)). The WUE distribution is comparable to soil parameters and measured yield circulation, which indicates high applicability with significant improvement in yield response.

TI  - Assessment of spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics in tropical arid ecosystem of India using MODIS time-series vegetation indices
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, we analyzed spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics to identify and delineate the vegetation stress zones in tropical arid ecosystem of Anantapuramu district, Andhra Pradesh, India, using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Vegetation Anomaly Index (VAI) derived from time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 16-day products (MOD13Q1) at 250 m spatial resolution for the growing season (June to September) of 19 years during 2000 to 2018. The 1-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was computed for 30 years (1989 to 2018) to quantify the precipitation deficit/surplus regions and assess its influence on vegetation dynamics. The growing season mean NDVI and VCI were correlated with growing season mean 1-month SPI of dry (2003) and wet (2007) years to analyze the spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics. The correlation analysis between SPI and NDVI for dry year (2003) showed strong positive correlation (r= 0.89). Analysis of VAI for dry year (2003) indicates that the central, western, and south-western parts of the district reported high vegetation stress with VAI of less than - 2.0. This might be due to the fact that central and south-western parts of the district are more prone to droughts than the other parts of the district. The correlation analysis of SPI, NDVI, and VCI distinctly shows the impact of rainfall on vegetation dynamics. The study clearly demonstrates the robustness of NDVI, VCI, and VAI derived from time-series MODIS data in monitoring the spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics and delineate vegetation stress zones in tropical arid ecosystem of India.

TI  - Using two-stream theory to capture fluctuations of satellite-perceived TOA SW radiances reflected from clouds over ocean
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Shortwave (SW) fluxes estimated from broadband radiometry rely on empirically gathered and hemispherically resolved fields of outgoing top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances. This study aims to provide more accurate and precise fields of TOA SW radiances reflected from clouds over ocean by introducing a novel semiphysical model predicting radiances per narrow sun-observer geometry. This model was statistically trained using CERES-measured radiances paired with MODIS-retrieved cloud parameters as well as reanalysis-based geophysical parameters. By using radiative transfer approximations as a framework to ingest the above parameters, the new approach incorporates cloud-top effective radius and above-cloud water vapor in addition to traditionally used cloud optical depth, cloud fraction, cloud phase, and surface wind speed. A two-stream cloud albedo - serving to statistically incorporate cloud optical thickness and cloud-top effective radius - and Cox-Munk ocean reflectance were used to describe an albedo over each CERES footprint. Effective-radius-dependent asymmetry parameters were obtained empirically and separately for each viewing-illumination geometry. A simple equation of radiative transfer, with this albedo and attenuating above-cloud water vapor as inputs, was used in its log-linear form to allow for statistical optimization. We identified the two-stream functional form that minimized radiance residuals calculated against CERES observations and outperformed the state-of-the-art approach for most observer geometries outside the sun-glint and solar zenith angles between 20 and 70 degrees, reducing the median SD of radiance residuals per solar geometry by up to 13.2 % for liquid clouds, 1.9 % for ice clouds, and 35.8 % for footprints containing both cloud phases. Geometries affected by sun glint (constituting between 10 % and 1 % of the discretized upward hemisphere for solar zenith angles of 20 and 70 degrees, respectively), however, often showed weaker performance when handled with the new approach and had increased residuals by as much as 60 % compared to the state-of-the-art approach. Overall, uncertainties were reduced for liquid-phase and mixed-phase footprints by 5.76 % and 10.81 %, respectively, while uncertainties for ice-phase footprints increased by 0.34 %. Tested for a variety of scenes, we further demonstrated the plausibility of scene-wise predicted radiance fields. This new approach may prove useful when employed in angular distribution models and may result in improved flux estimates, in particular dealing with clouds characterized by small or large droplet/crystal sizes.

TI  - Preoperative tumor biopsy results in more detected sentinel nodes than intraoperative biopsy in breast cancer patients
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) plays a vital role in breast cancer surgery, and the identified number of sentinel nodes determines its accuracy for representing the status of the axillae. There are two types of tumor biopsies in breast cancer: preoperative and intraoperative biopsies. We compared the effects of the two different biopsies on the results of SLNB. Methods Patients with clinical stages T1-3, N0 (cT1-3 N0) tumors were enrolled in this study. A total of 53% of patients received preoperative tumor biopsy, and 47% received intraoperative excisional biopsy. To identify the sentinel lymph nodes, patients received dual tracer injection. The number of SLNs detected and the false-negative rate were compared between groups. Results A total of 204 patients were enrolled, 108 received preoperative tumor biopsy, and 96 received intraoperative excisional biopsy. Among all the patients, 160 received axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) following SLNB. Preoperative tumor biopsy detected more SLNs than intraoperative biopsy (mean rank 113.87 vs. 90.9,p= 0.004). The false-negative rates in the preoperative and intraoperative tumor biopsy groups were 3% and 18%, respectively. Conclusions Patients in the preoperative tumor biopsy group had more SLNs identified than intraoperative biopsy patients. The false-negative rate was also lower in the preoperative biopsy group.

TI  - Environmental and landscape influences on the spatial and temporal distribution of a cattle herd in a South Texas rangeland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The multiple spatial and temporal parameters affecting cattle herd distribution and activity dynamics can significantly affect resource utilization but are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether current animal tracking technology and spatio-temporal analysis tools can be used to integrate multi-scale information on herd distribution patterns as a function of seasonal forage production, periods of the day, animal activity, and landscape features. Positional and activity information of 11 free-ranging cows within a 31-member herd was obtained at 5-min intervals by using GPS collars for 1 year within a 457-ha ranch in the semi-arid rangelands of South Texas. Forage biomass was calculated with satellite imagery. Spatial analysis of cattle distribution and landscape features was conducted with GIS. Herd spread was greatest during the growing season. Throughout the year, during midday, the herd showed smaller spread and greater use of shade patches than any other time of day. Cattle also aggregated under trees in winter, particularly during the night. There was no statistically significant overall pattern of seasonal changes in the use of water and supplemental feeding areas, but a trend toward highest use during the winter. However, significantly different diurnal patterns in the use of supplemental feed and water were observed within each season. This study found a strong influence of shade patches relative to the influence of water and supplemental feeding areas on the diurnal and seasonal movement patterns of cattle in shrub-dominated rangeland. Although this study used only 11 tracked cows in a 31-member herd, the results indicated that techniques such as seasonal and diurnal GPS tracking, GIS, and remote sensing data enable evaluation of multiple spatial and temporal dynamics of cattle distribution and activity patterns. The smaller spread during the dry winter season associated with the observed aggregation of individuals in water and supplemental feeding areas, may aid in determining the most critical times for providing supplemental resources and guide the allocation of those resources to areas not frequently used by cattle, thus stimulating the animals to visit unused sites during the non-growing season.

TI  - Characterization of the Soil Properties of Citrus Orchards in Central India using Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - NATIONAL ACADEMY SCIENCE LETTERS-INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Nagpur mandarin (Citrus reticulataBlanco), considered as one of the major commercial fruit crops, is grown in hot, dry and sub-humid bioclimatic region of Central India. Area under this cash crop is highest in the state Maharashtra, but low productivity as compared to other citrus-growing states of India is of a major concern. Information regarding the productive suitable areas for this crop cultivation in the state is lacking in order to address the problem. Hence, a study was conducted in Wardha district of Maharashtra to find out the most suitable soil-site characteristics for citrus orchards to enhance the productivity. In the present investigation, inductive modeling approach is used to derive the required properties. The objective was to compare the soil properties with the established suitability criteria for citrus to minimize soil-related constraints and thus to enhance the quantity as well as quality of the produce. The citrus-grown areas were visually interpreted from merged product of IRS LISS-IV and Cartosat-1 image of the study area. The healthy citrus orchard areas were identified based onnormalized difference vegetation index(NDVI) values derived from LISS-IV image. The layer which contained the information of higher NDVI values with citrus orchards was overlaid on the soil and slope map of the study area to obtain desired soil and slope information. Results revealed that heavy textured clay soils dominated the healthy citrus orchards. Soil reaction was alkaline (11.49 thousand ha) in majority of the areas followed by neutral (1.75 thousand ha) pH. Orchards were mostly located at very gently sloping condition, and in most of the cases, soils were very deep in nature. The study thus revealed the most suitable physical, fertility and chemical properties of soil and other properties like slope for better management of citrus-growing orchards in Maharashtra.

TI  - Comparison of new individual and hybrid machine learning algorithms for modeling and mapping fire hazard: a supplementary analysis of fire hazard in different counties of Golestan Province in Iran
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest fire hazard mapping using the accurate models in the fire-prone areas has particular importance to predict the future fire occurrence and allocate the resources for preventing the fire ignition. This research aimed to compare the accuracy of some individual models including boosted regression tree (BRT), classification and regression trees (CART), functional discriminant analysis (FDA), generalized linear model (GLM), mixture discriminant analysis (MDA), random forest (RF) and two new hybrid models including FDA-GLM-MDA and RF-CART-BRT for predicting the fire hazard in a fire-prone area in the northeast Iran, Golestan Province. For this purpose, a comprehensive dataset from ten effective parameters including digital elevation model (DEM), slope angle (SA), plan curvature (PC), topographic wetness index (TWI), annual rainfall mean (ARM), annual temperature mean (ATM), wind effect (WE), distance to urban areas (DTU), distance to streams (DTS) and distance to roads (DTR) was created in GIS. Furthermore, 3705 historical fire locations in the Golestan Province from 2002 to 2017 were obtained from MODIS fire product dataset. Then, the variable importance was assessed using the XGBoost machine learning (ML) technique. Finally, the individual and hybrid models were evaluated using the ROC-AUC method. The results showed that the DTU was the most important factor in modeling and mapping the fire hazard in the Golestan Province. Also, the results demonstrated that the individual random forest (RF) (AUC = 0.855) and hybrid RF-CART-BRT algorithms (AUC = 0.854) were the most accurate predictive models for mapping the fire hazard in the Golestan Province, respectively. Considering the high significance of DTU in fire occurrence in this study, the area of fire hazard classes in fourteen different counties of the Golestan Province was calculated using the most accurate model (RF model). The final results indicated that Minudasht County had the most area (35.55%) of fire hazard in the very high fire hazard class. The results of this study are very useful for local forest managers to control the future fires using the best model in the natural areas of the Golestan Province, especially in Minudasht County. The protective management of the natural areas of the Golestan Province would be performed based on the fire hazard maps produced by RF and RF-CART-BRT algorithms. We recommend applying these models for fire danger mapping in fire-prone areas around the world which have semi-arid conditions. More comparative assessment of individual and ensemble models for fire danger mapping in semi-arid areas around the world could provide a baseline for monitoring fire danger in similar conditions.

TI  - To be or not to be tolerant? A Terror Management perspective exploring the ideological dilemma of tolerance and prejudice
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tolerance has been identified as a way to reduce prejudice. However, tolerance has also been posited as an ideological dilemma and may have its limits. The present research explores this idea, utilizing insights from Terror Management Theory. Three studies were conducted using online samples. Study 1 found that a tolerance prime led to less discrimination towards Muslims after being reminded of death, but increased discrimination when reminded of terrorism. Additionally, tolerance did not affect levels of affective prejudice. Study 2 found that reading an essay that threatened the norm of tolerance led to increased levels of death-thought accessibility and worldview defence, particularly amongst liberal participants. Study 3 found that a tolerance prime attenuated mortality salience decreasing support for author rights, but not if the worldview critic was intolerant. Taken together, the present findings suggest that using tolerance to reduce prejudice and foster more positive intergroup relations has its boundaries. If others are perceived to not be tolerant themselves, then people may be more motivated to defend, rather than uphold the norm of tolerance.

TI  - Solar eclipse skies and limb reddening
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - During solar eclipses the sunlit tops of cloud layers and arctic sea ice near the umbra appear salmon-brown when viewed from airplanes or satellites. Under these conditions, the clouds and atmosphere are illuminated by light restricted to the solar limb, which has effective radiating temperatures as low as 4000 K. The resulting limb reddening largely accounts for the color. A second-order scattering model is used to simulate the color of photographs of cloud tops taken from a flight during the 21 August 2017 eclipse and MODIS Aqua and Terra satellite "true color" images during the 2 July 2019 eclipse. These observed color changes provide data that has potential value in determining the vertical temperature profile of the solar photosphere. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America

TI  - Targeted Imaging of CD206 Expressing Tumor-Associated M2-like Macrophages Using Mannose-Conjugated Antibiofouling Magnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles
T2  - ACS APPLIED BIO MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been shown to promote cancer progression, their roles in tumor development and resistance to therapy remain to be fully understood, mainly because of the lack of a good approach to evaluate the dynamic changes of heterogeneous macrophages in their residing microenvironment. Here, we report an approach of using antibiofouling PEG-b-AGE polymer-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) for targeted imaging of mannose receptor (CD206)-expressing M2-like TAMs. Antibiofouling polymer coatings block non-specific phagocytosis of IONPs by different cells but enable ligand-mediated CD206(+) M2-like macrophage targeting after surface functionalizing with mannose (Man-IONP). Costaining tissue sections of the 4T1 mouse mammary tumors using an anti-CD206 antibody and fluorescent dye (TRITC)-labeled Man-IONP showed 94.7 +/- 4.5% colocalization of TRITC-Man-IONPs with the anti-CD206 antibody. At 48 h after intravenous (i.v.) injection of Man-IONPs, magnetic resonance imaging of mice bearing orthotopic 4T1 mammary tumors showed a significantly larger IONP-induced decrease of the transverse relaxation time (T-2) in tumors with 29.4 +/- 1.5 ms compared to 12.3 +/- 3.6 ms in tumors that received non-targeted IONP probes (P < 0.001). Immunofluorescence-stained tumor tissue sections collected at 6, 18, and 24 h after i.v. administration of the nanoprobes revealed that Man-IONPs specifically targeted CD206(+) M2-like macrophages in various tumor areas at all time points, while nonconjugated IONPs were absent in the tumor after 18 h. Thus, antibiofouling Man-IONPs demonstrated the capability of explicitly imaging CD206(+) M2-like macrophages in vivo and potentials for investigating the dynamics of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment and delivering therapeutics targeting M2-like TAMs.

T2  - SURGICAL INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been an alternative to axillary lymph node dissection as a standard procedure for breast cancer patients with clinically negative lymph nodes. Endoscopic technique has been developed for over 20 years but remains to be mastered by a slice of surgeons. Suction and squeezing in the liposuction endoscopic procedures may increase risk of local recurrence and metastasis. In this study, we present our method of SLNB procedure through the periareolar incision which improves the shape of the breast-conserving surgery.Patients and Procedures. Twenty-eight breast cancer patients with clinically negative lymph nodes received this procedure. Methylene blue dye and technetium-99m sulfur colloid were used to be the tracker of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Periareolar incision was the main surgical technique. The STORZ HD endoscopic system and some special instruments were used during the operation.Results.SLNs can be accurately located and biopsied under an endoscope without additional incisions. The SLNs detection rate, sensitivity, and false-negative rate are 88%, 80%, and 11.1%, respectively. And, the complications such as paresthesia and upper limb lymphedema are similar compared with traditional breast-conserving surgery (10.7% vs 9.8% and 7.1% vs 7.8%).Conclusion.Endoscopic technique can be used to accurately assess the status of SLNs in patients with breast cancer. Nonliposuction endoscopic breast-conserving surgery is one of the safe and alternative surgical procedures for early breast cancer.

TI  - Characteristics of aerosol optical depth over land types in central Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols are an important contributor to global atmospheric changes and have critical effects on the climate system. Regionally, aerosols in central Asia comprise a significant portion of global aerosols. Based on aerosol optical depth (AOD)Level 2 daily product data and land cover type product data, the long-term AOD characteristics of six major land use/cover types and their relationships with landscape metrics are discussed. Contribution analysis is applied to quantitatively estimate the effects of land use/cover on regional AOD over central Asia. The results show that series of daily AODs over six land uses/covers display remarkable annual cyclic variations and obvious seasonal changes. The annual average AODs for barren land and cropland are highest, followed by regional AODs. There are different frequencies and times of occurrence for high AOD values of various land types. Urban areas are one of the major contributors to the regional atmosphere in winter; grasslands have a great influence on regional AOD decreases. Barren land always has a high contribution to the regional AOD. The land use types affected by anthropogenic activities were smaller contributors to regional aerosols than barren lands affected by climate factors. This paper advances the understanding of relationship between aerosols and land use/cover and facilitates land use decision making. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Patient preferences for locoregional therapy in early-stage breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose With an increasing emphasis on patient-centered care, clinicians in subspecialties such as breast surgery and radiation oncology that offer multiple therapeutic options with equivalent outcomes are under increasing pressure to aid patients with the decision-making process. The aim of this review is to summarize existing studies that either evaluated factors in patient's decision-making regarding locoregional therapy in early-stage breast cancer or evaluated benefit thresholds required to change therapy decisions. Methods A PubMed search to identify prospective or retrospective studies written in English reporting factors in patient decision-making regarding locoregional therapy in early-stage breast cancer was conducted. No restriction was placed on publication date. Studies that focused on breast reconstruction decisions or on patient preferences for decision-making involvement were excluded. Results A total of 39 studies were identified; 19 examining patient preferences for breast-conserving surgery versus mastectomy, 7 on preferences for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, 2 on non-surgical options, 2 on the extent of axillary surgery, and 9 on radiation therapy decisions. Themes such as fear of recurrence, desire to avoid additional invasive therapy, and the importance of physician preference were common, but many studies also highlighted factors important to specific subpopulations of women. Conclusions Patient preference is difficult to define and measure, and heterogeneity across studies renders direct comparison difficult. Future work is needed to define women's risk-thresholds for certain treatments, delve into the psychological factors that direct their decisions, and understand how patients' valuations of risk interact with society's.

TI  - Validation of an EMR algorithm to measure the prevalence of ADHD in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN)
T2  - BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Building and validating electronic algorithms to identify patients with specific disease profiles using health data is becoming increasingly important to disease surveillance and population health management.The aim of this study was to develop and validate an algorithm to find patients with ADHD diagnoses within primary care electronic medical records (EMR); and then use the algorithm to describe the epidemiology of ADHD from 2008 to 2015 in a Canadian Primary care sample. Methods This was a cross sectional time series that used data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN), a repository of primary care EMR data. A sample of electronic patient charts from one local clinic were manually reviewed to determine the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of an ADHD case-finding algorithm. In each study year a practice population was determined, and the algorithm was used to measure an observed prevalence of ADHD. The observed prevalence was adjusted for misclassification, as measured by the validity indices, to obtain an estimate of the true prevalence. Estimates were calculated by age group (4-17 year olds, 18 to 34 year olds, and 35 to 64 year olds) and gender, and compared over time. Results The EMR algorithm had a PPV of 98.0% (95% CI [92.5, 99.5]) and an NPV of 95.0% (95% CI [92.9, 98.6]). After adjusting for misclassification, it was determined that the prevalence of patients with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD has risen in all age groups between 2008 and 2015, most notably in children and young adults (6.92, 95% CI [5.62, 8.39] to 8.57, 95% CI [7.32, 10.00]; 5.73, 95% CI [4.40, 7.23] to 7.33, 95% CI [6.04, 8.78], respectively). The well-established gender gap persisted in all age groups across time but was considerably smaller in older adults compared to children and young adults. Conclusion Overall, the ADHD case-finding algorithm was found to be a valid tool to assess the epidemiology of ADHD in Canadian primary care practice. The increased prevalence of ADHD between 2008 and 2015 may reflect an improvement in the recognition and treatment of this disorder within primary care.

TI  - Crop type mapping using LiDAR, Sentinel-2 and aerial imagery with machine learning algorithms
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - LiDAR data are becoming increasingly available, which has opened up many new applications. One such application is crop type mapping. Accurate crop type maps are critical for monitoring water use, estimating harvests and in precision agriculture. The traditional approach to obtaining maps of cultivated fields is by manually digitizing the fields from satellite or aerial imagery and then assigning crop type labels to each field - often informed by data collected during ground and aerial surveys. However, manual digitizing and labeling is time-consuming, expensive and subject to human error. Automated remote sensing methods is a cost-effective alternative, with machine learning gaining popularity for classifying crop types. This study evaluated the use of LiDAR data, Sentinel-2 imagery, aerial imagery and machine learning for differentiating five crop types in an intensively cultivated area. Different combinations of the three datasets were evaluated along with ten machine learning. The classification results were interpreted by comparing overall accuracies, kappa, standard deviation and f-score. It was found that LiDAR data successfully differentiated between different crop types, with XGBoost providing the highest overall accuracy of 87.8%. Furthermore, the crop type maps produced using the LiDAR data were in general agreement with those obtained by using Sentinel-2 data, with LiDAR obtaining a mean overall accuracy of 84.3% and Sentinel-2 a mean overall accuracy of 83.6%. However, the combination of all three datasets proved to be the most effective at differentiating between the crop types, with RF providing the highest overall accuracy of 94.4%. These findings provide a foundation for selecting the appropriate combination of remotely sensed data sources and machine learning algorithms for operational crop type mapping.

TI  - Geoinformatics and geophysical survey-based estimation of best groundwater potential sites through surface and subsurface indicators
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is the most important natural resource around the world which needs new and advanced technologies for control and monitoring. This investigation was to check the groundwater potential zones by integrated techniques of geoinformatics and geophysical investigation through a vertical electrical sounding in Rawalakot, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. The study area being a sedimentary basin, sandstone is the major rock type with good porosity and permeability. Satellite data were used to generate different thematic maps such as slope percent, lineament density, land use/cover, drainage density, geology, roughness index, curvature, topographic wetness index, and rainfall. Subsequently suitable rank and weightage was assinged for final weight overlay analysis to identify the groundwater potential zones. Final potential map was generated with good, moderate, and poor zones. This analysis revealed that 92.60% of the area is categorized to be having good to moderate groundwater potential. Then, an electrical resistivity survey was done by vertical electrical sounding (VES) using Schlumberger electrode configuration, at 32 locations to check the subsurface condition. The predominant curve types were Q type, A type, H type, and K type. The apparent resistivity was calculated at 20-m, 40-m, and 60-m depths. Dar-Zarrouk parameters were calculated to identify the subsurface aquifers and protective capacity rating. Integrating the outcome of GIS and geophysical studies, the region with good groundwater potential was delineated with more accuracy.

TI  - Platelet function in stroke/transient ischemic attack patients treated with tocotrienol
T2  - FASEB JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of tocotrienol form of vitamin E (TCT) on platelet function in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). A double blind, randomized, single center phase II clinical trial was conducted comparing placebo (PBO) and 400 and 800 mg TCT daily for a year in 150 patients with a sentinel ischemic stroke or TIA event in the prior 6 months. Platelet function was measured at baseline and then, at 3 month intervals for a year, using light transmission aggregometry. The incidence of aspirin resistance in aspirin-treated patients or platelet inhibition in patients on clopidogrel alone was compared between the three treatment groups. Results showed that in patients taking aspirin and clopidogrel, the incidence of aspirin resistance was significantly decreased from 40% in PBO-treated patients to 9% in the 400 mg TCT group and 25% in the TCT 800 mg group (P = .03). In conclusion, patients on aspirin and clopidogrel had a higher incidence of aspirin resistance than all patients treated with aspirin alone and TCT decreased the frequency of aspirin resistance in this group.

TI  - Impact of 2019-2020 mega-fires on Australian fauna habitat
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Australia's 2019-2020 mega-fires were exacerbated by drought, anthropogenic climate change and existing land-use management. Here, using a combination of remotely sensed data and species distribution models, we found these fires burnt similar to 97,000 km(2) of vegetation across southern and eastern Australia, which is considered habitat for 832 species of native vertebrate fauna. Seventy taxa had a substantial proportion (>30%) of habitat impacted; 21 of these were already listed as threatened with extinction. To avoid further species declines, Australia must urgently reassess the extinction vulnerability of fire-impacted species and assist the recovery of populations in both burnt and unburnt areas. Population recovery requires multipronged strategies aimed at ameliorating current and fire-induced threats, including proactively protecting unburnt habitats.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution of tropical forest degradation and its impact on ecological sensitivity: A case study in Jinghong, Xishuangbanna, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to rapid urbanization and a growing population, the tropical forest in southwestern China has experienced a dramatic shrinkage, which threatens its biodiversity and imposes limitations to sustainable development. Spatiotemporal change analysis and ecological sensitivity assessment are the important prerequisites for investigating the relationship between eco-environmental quality and human activities. In this study, the tropical forest and other land cover types in Jinghong, China were firstly classified by a machine learning classification algorithm (support vector machine, SVM) with 7 pairs of remote sensing (RS) data (from 1989 to 2018). Then the spatiotemporal change patterns were analyzed. The ecological sensitivity was evaluated based on an index system method (ISM) in which a weighted combination of eleven indicators were produced using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and GIS. Meanwhile four individual sensitivity indicators, including biodiversity sensitivity (BS), water resources sensitivity (WRS), geological hazard sensitivity (GHS) and soil erosion sensitivity (SES) were assessed respectively to create a multi-perspective understanding of the entire ecological sensitivity. The results suggest that the tropical forest experienced a continual decrease from 5631.78 km(2) in 1999 to 4216.23 km(2) in 2018 with an average change rate of -1.49%. The decreased area was mainly encroached on by human settlements and agriculture, particularly in the south of Jinghong. Furthermore, it could be seen that urbanization is the key driver for the changes to ecological sensitivity with both positive and negative impacts. In Jinghong, the region covered by a tropical forest has a relatively higher comprehensive ecological sensitivity (CES) than that of an urban area. This work shows RS and GIS to be powerful tools providing profound insights to researchers with regard to the spatiotemporal evolution of tropical forests and ecological sensitivity. The results are significant for improving policies in order to keep a sustainable balance in regional ecosystem management. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon emission from thermokarst lakes inNEEuropean tundra
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from inland waters is recognized as highly important and an understudied part of the terrestrial carbon (C) biogeochemical cycle. These emissions are still poorly quantified in subarctic regions that contain vast amounts of surface C in permafrost peatlands. This is especially true in NE European peatlands, located within sporadic to discontinuous permafrost zones which are highly vulnerable to thaw. Initial measurements of C emissions from lentic waters of the Bolshezemelskaya Tundra (BZT; 200,000 km(2)) demonstrated sizable CO(2)and CH(4)concentrations and fluxes to the atmosphere in 98 depressions, thaw ponds, and thermokarst lakes ranging from 0.5 x 10(6)to 5 x 10(6) m(2)in size. CO(2)fluxes decreased by an order of magnitude as waterbody size increased by > 3 orders of magnitude while CH(4)fluxes showed large variability unrelated to lake size. By using a combination of Landsat-8 and GeoEye-1 images, we determined lakes cover 4% of BZT and thus calculated overall C emissions from lentic waters to be 3.8 +/- 0.65 Tg C yr(-1)(99% C-CO2, 1% C-CH4), which is two times higher than the lateral riverine export. Large lakes dominated GHG emissions whereas small thaw ponds had a minor contribution to overall water surface area and GHG emissions. These data suggest that, if permafrost thaw in NE Europe results in disappearance of large thermokarst lakes and formation of new small thaw ponds and depressions, GHG emissions from lentic waters in this region may decrease.

TI  - The combined global gravity field model XGM2019e
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - XGM2019e is a combined global gravity field model represented by spheroidal harmonics up to degree and order (d/o) 5399, corresponding to a spatial resolution of 2 ' (similar to 4 km). As data sources, it includes the satellite model GOCO06s in the longer wavelength range up to d/o 300 combined with a ground gravity grid which also covers the shorter wavelengths. The ground data consist over land and ocean of gravity anomalies provided by courtesy of NGA (15 ' resolution, identical to XGM2016) augmented with topographically derived gravity information over land (EARTH2014). Over the oceans, gravity anomalies derived from satellite altimetry are used (DTU13 with a resolution of 1 '). The combination of the satellite data with the ground gravity observations is performed by using full normal equations up to d/o 719 (15 '). Beyond d/o 719, a block-diagonal least squares solution is calculated for the high-resolution ground gravity data (from topography and altimetry). All calculations are performed in the spheroidal harmonic domain. In the spectral band up to d/o 719, the new model shows a slightly improved behaviour in the magnitude of a few mm RMS over land as compared to preceding models such as XGM2016, EIGEN6c4 or EGM2008 when validated with independent geoid information derived from GNSS/levelling. Over land and in the spectral range above d/o 719, the accuracy of XGM2019e marginally suffers from the sole use of topographic forward modelling, and geoid differences at GNSS/levelling stations are increased in the order of several mm RMS in well-surveyed areas, such as the US and Europe, compared to models containing real gravity data over their entire spectrum, e.g. EIGEN6c4 or EGM2008. However, GNSS/levelling validation also indicates that the performance of XGM2019e can be considered as globally more consistent and independent of existing high-resolution global models. Over the oceans, the model exhibits an enhanced performance (equal or better than preceding models), which is confirmed by comparison of the MDT's computed from CNES/CLS 2015 mean sea surface and the high-resolution geoid models. The MDT based on XGM2019e shows fewer artefacts, particularly in the coastal regions, and fits globally better to DTU17MDT which is considered as an independent reference MDT.

T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Xiaolangdi Basin of the Yellow River, located between Mengjin County and Jiyuan City in Henan Province, is composed of a reservoir, a barrage dam, flood discharge buildings, and a water diversion and power generation system, among which, the Xiaolangdi project is the only control project in the lower reaches of the Yellow River that has a large storage capacity. In this study, distributed scatterers InSAR (DS-InSAR) deformation analysis was used to process 27 images of ESA Sentinel-1A data for the period between September 10, 2018, and July 19, 2019. Using the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) to select the statistical homogeneous pixels (SHP) and the eigenvalue decomposition method to optimize the interference phase, the time series surface deformation of the study area was obtained. The results showed that the maximum deformation rate in the study area was - 40.71 mm/year, the maximum deformation rate of the Xiaolangdi project was - 10.09 mm/year, and the larger deformation rates in the area around the Xiaolangdi Reservoir were mostly within the range - 35 to - 20 mm/year. Furthermore, small baseline subset (SBAS) InSAR and DS-InSAR are used for verification and analysis, and the monitoring results have high consistency. Therefore, to sum up, the time series deformation of low coherence areas may be monitored using DS-InSAR.

TI  - Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and Molecular Fluorescence near Gain Assisted Refractory Nitrides Based Plasmonic Core-Shell Nanoparticle
T2  - PLASMONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and molecular fluorescence (MF) plays a vital role in protein-protein interaction, detection of nucleic acids, photochemistry, molecular spectroscopy, forensics, fingerprinting, photovoltaics, etc., to name only a few. The present work focus on developing closed form expressions for FRET enhancement, fluorescence yield (FY), and quantum yield (QY) in the presence of core-shell nanoparticle (CSNP) consisting of dielectric core and metallic shell. It is shown that the plasmonic nanoparticle enhance the FRET significantly only when the donor and acceptor molecules are far apart. When both molecules are closely placed (similar to 1 nm), plasmonic nanoparticle does not enhance the FRET significantly. Therefore, when acceptor-donor molecules of chromophore are closely placed, significant FRET enhancement cannot be realized via molecule-surface plasmon interaction. The present work shows that this problem can be resolved by incorporating optical gain in the dielectric core of CSNP, and this is an effective mechanism for enhancing molecular interaction when donor-acceptor molecules are closely placed. In addition to FRET, molecular fluorescence in the presence of CSNP is also studied. The well-established Gersten-Nitzan model is extended to derive closed form expressions for FRET, FY, and QY, albeit near core-shell nanoparticle. Notably, gigantic enhancement in FRET and FY by virtue of loss compensation is accompanied by reduction in resonance linewidth. Refractory nitrides (e.g., ZrN and TiN) based CSNPs are assessed for their feasibility in enhancing FRET, and FY and performance comparison with Au is also presented.

TI  - Land deformation monitoring using optical remote sensing and PS-InSAR technique nearby Gangotri glacier in higher Himalayas
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, we have introduced a strategic technique for interrelating between slow land surface movement (SLSM) and land susceptibility (LS) map of a higher Himalayan region nearby Gangotri, India by integrating geospatial techniques based on modified frequency ratio technique acquired by optical remote sensing for LS mapping. On the other hand, PS-InSAR technique acquired by microwave remote sensing has been used for monitoring the SLSM. As SLSM is one of the major geological hazard susceptible for highly undulating terrain like Gangotri glacier basin in higher Himalaya which is also a most attractive tourist region in Uttarakhand, India. With the integration of this technology, it would be possible for monitoring SLSM and mapping LS of any hazardous area. PS-InSAR technique allows efficient planning by providing meticulous data about SLSM. PS-InSAR technique is used for monitoring SLSM in scale small within approximately millimetre range. Further, we have used SAR imageries of C band of ENVISAT satellite for the duration of March 2004-May 2007 for nearby Gangotri region. This work also comprises using satellite imageries of Landsat 7, Sentinel 2 and SRTM data for LS mapping purpose. The result shows that in the vicinity of the Gangotri region, the land surface movement was observed around 2 to 18 mm. Also, the study showed that the SLSM affected regions come under the High-risk zone of LS and vice versa.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a life-sustaining resource catering the daily water requirements of mankind, aids in industrial development, influences agricultural activity, and maintains the ecological balance. The present study was carried out in the Karha river basin, Maharashtra State, having an area of 1314.98 km(2). In hydro-geological research, for the exploration of groundwater resources, the integration of remote sensing data and GIS plays a remarkable role in monitoring, assessing, and conserving groundwater resources for water resource management and development. A total ten thematic layers such as geomorphology, geology, land use/land cover, drainage density, slope angle, lineament density, rainfall distribution map, curvature, topographical wetness index, and soil map were integrated into a GIS platform, using the spatial analyst tool in Arc GIS 10.0 to delineate the Ground Water Potential Zones in Karha river basin area. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique is used to determine the weighted value for each parameter and their sub-parameters, based on their relative importance of influencing factors for groundwater recharge. The final groundwater potential zonation map of the study area was categorized into four classes namely, poor, moderate, good, and excellent potential zones. The western part of the basin, particularly in Ghorawadi, Garade, and Saswad regions, have been identified as excellent potential zones for groundwater exploration. The result has shown about 21.96% (285.43 km(2)) and 28.82% (374.49 km(2)) of the study area falls under "excellent" and "good" groundwater potential zone, respectively, whereas about 10.81% (140.46 km(2)) area falls under the poor potential zone.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION

AB  - To be able to predict habitat quality and potential distribution of threatened species is key to developing successful conservation strategies for threatened species with fragmented distributions. The aim of this study was to assess factors that limit the local distribution and density ofLycaena helle, an endangered butterfly, in central Sweden, and to estimate its mobility in order to classify local populations according to their importance for the connectivity on a regional level. An additional aim was to test ifL. hellehabitat quality could be assessed using remotely-sensed data such as laser scanning (LiDAR). We derived potential predictors ofL. helleoccurrence from laser scanning data and used a resource selection function to assess their predictive power. We used a mark-recapture approach to studyL. hellemovement and estimate dispersal distances. The probability of occurrence ofL. helleincreased with higher solar irradiation and was negatively affected by sloping terrain, but the LiDAR data generally had low predictive power. Population density increased with host plant density, but this effect was weak. The mark-recapture study confirmed thatL. helleis very sedentary, with a mean movement distance of only 114 m and a maximum of 600 m. The studied population extends over a large network of interconnected linear habitats, which probably facilitates dispersal and thereby population persistence. Our study highlight the importance of a warm micro-climate and of man-made habitats like road verges and power-line corridors for the conservation ofL. helle.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in vulvar cancer: status, level of knowledge, and counseling in outpatient setting
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Evaluating the counseling of patients with vulvar cancer in outpatient setting regarding the application of sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND), the selection of hospitals for further treatment, and level of knowledge. Methods A questionnaire containing 29 questions about SLND in vulvar cancer was sent to gynecologists in Lower Saxony. The questionnaire contained multiple choice questions and open questions. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Results The median age of the 86 respondents was 54 (26-66) years. Most participants (83.1%) reported to only treat one to five patients with vulvar cancer per year. Interestingly, 70.5% of the gynecologists send their patients to university hospitals and 64.1% to hospitals offering maximum care, respectively. Of all, 32.7% replied that SLND was performed rarely or never in their patients. The gynecologists answered that only 36.7% of the patients are well informed about advantages and possible disadvantages of SLND. Most (84%) felt responsible to counsel patients on treatment decisions independently from or additionally to the hospital. Of all, 72% replied that they are not completely sure about the exact recurrence rates after SLND. Of notice, 66% believe that SLND for vulvar cancer is safe if applied in specialized centers and 92% stated that focusing treatment on specialized centers is required for best results. Conclusion SLND for vulvar cancer is widely accepted and regularly recommended among gynecologists. Outpatient doctors report to send most patients to specialized centers. However, it appears that patients remain uninformed after counseling in the clinics and that there is a lack of detailed knowledge about risks and complication rates of groin treatment in the outpatient setting.

TI  - Impact of Forest Cover Change on Available Water Resources: Long-Term Forest Cover Dynamics of the Semi-Arid Dhofar Cloud Forest, Oman
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover dynamics are an important indicator for climate change as well as for land conversion studies. Based on an analysis of 30 years of Landsat data a forest cover time series was generated and analyzed for the Dhofar mountains in Oman. The Dhofar mountains in Southern Oman with its semi-arid cloud forest is an important asset for livestock, water resources, and tourism. In this study we investigated whether forest cover trends are distinguishable and what impact forest cover changes have on water availability. To cope with gaps in the Landsat dataset the Dhofar mountains were divided into regions of interest (ROIs) that were based on hydrologic catchment boundaries. The results show, that, despite increasing pressure from tourism and increasing livestock numbers, the forest cover shows slight but not significant increases in most ROIs and significant forest cover increases in three ROIs. Overall, forest cover during the past 30 years is at least stable and most probably slightly increasing. With regard to water resources results show that, the impact of cloud forest interception amounts to an additional subcanopy water input of about 15-150% of annual rainfall. This additional water is only available below tree cover. Part of that water is, of course used by plant transpiration, however, the stemflow portion which is exceptionally high in this region infiltrates directly into deeper soil layers and eventually leads to groundwater recharge.

TI  - Feasibility of targeted fishing in mesoscale oceanic eddies: a study from commercial fishing grounds of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale eddies are important ocean phenomena that enhance biological productivity by mixing of water column and influence fishery catches, especially in stratified seas such as Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea. The current study was conducted around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI), India located in the Eastern Indian Ocean. The study tested the feasibility of targeted fishing in eddies, by characterizing the mesoscale eddies in the region, towards developing operational altimetry-based fishery advisories for the fishers. We analysed fish catch data from 15,370 commercial fishing trips from the Islands using five fishing gears during 2014-17 spatially vis-a-vis the eddies delineated from Maps of Sea Level Anomaly (M-SLA). We show that 5-24% of the routine commercial catches occurred in eddies, fishery catches are positively influenced by different eddy zones and the fish catch using different fishing gear are significantly higher in some of the eddy zones. We generated experimental advisories showing locations of eddies and their zones, identified using Near Real-Time M-SLA data and guided the commercial fishers for targeted fishing in eddies. The fish Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) from the experimental fishing within the eddy zones was significantly (p < 0.01) higher than that from the traditional fishing grounds in the non-eddy areas. The spatio-temporal analysis of eddies around ANI during 2009-16 showed the occurrence of higher number of anticyclonic eddies, majority of which move westward and have a lifespan of less than 2 weeks and amplitude less than 4 cm. In the current study, the areas around ANI with frequent eddy occurrence and eddy density have been identified, which could aid in increasing the fishing intensity by targeting the pelagic fishes, using longlines, gillnets and ringnets. Thus, we show the possibility of using eddy fishing advisories generated from altimeter data, for augmenting the currently operational Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ) advisories that are generated using optical/thermal remote sensing data and disseminated to the coastal fishers in India. This will be helpful especially for the regions with and during periods of persistent cloud cover.

TI  - Full polarimetric ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 analysis of backscattering characteristics from various types of coasts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar has a clear advantage over optical satellites in being able to monitor the Earth's surface under any weather condition. The Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) aboard Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) is a unique and highly useful sensor that can acquire high-resolution data using dual-beam receivers. This study aimed at evaluating, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the backscattering characteristics detected via full polarimetric PALSAR-2 data from the shorelines of various types of coasts, using the administrative zone vector data of the National Land Numerical Information (NLNI) database. The four-component scattering images derived from full polarimetric PALSAR-2 data were used to evaluate the characteristics of scattering models that affect shoreline detection. Canny edge detection was applied to the four decomposed datasets (surface, double-bounce, volume and helix scattering power) and the edges of these four datasets were combined by logical conjunction analysis. The results show that a part of the edge line in the surface scattering power image corresponded with the sandy coast shoreline. The boundary between land and sea indicated by the edge line in the surface, double-bounce, volume and helix scattering power image corresponded with the rocky coast and seawalls shoreline, which were analysed using histograms. The relationship between the four-component scattering model and the edges in these components can be explained by an L-band SAR backscattering mechanism.

TI  - A new approach to quantify grazing pressure under mediterranean pastoral systems using GIS and remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pastoral systems based on grazing itineraries are very common along the Mediterranean region and provide an opportunity to manage the fuel load and reduce fire risk in the ecosystem. Daily and seasonal movements of flocks bring on different grazing pressure (GP) (sheep ha(-1)) over the landscape. This study presents an approach to model sheep GP under a Mediterranean pastoral system in the Northeast of Portugal. The GP in a given location depends on the distance from the stable to the parish border, the distance to the stable, the heads of livestock and their preference for land use and cover (LUC). The geoprocessing we applied in this study integrated several spatial databases: the latest official Portuguese vector mapping of land use and cover (COS2015) and administrative boundaries (CAOP2018), the livestock stables location, and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Images. During the geoprocessing, the stocking density (SD) (sheep ha(-1)) were calculated and spatially interpolated. Homogeneous LUC units (permanent crops; annual crops; forest; shrubland; grassland; water bodies) were obtained by Random Forest supervised classification algorithm (kappa = 89.3%; global accuracy = 91.2%). Boolean overlapping of the LUC classes obtained by the supervised classifier with the mask created from COS2015 provides the potentially grazed LUC classes. Integrating LUC preferences with SD allows calculating and mapping the GP. The most common GP class is 0-0.25 sheep ha(-1). Seeing the GP per LUC class, a value of 1.84 sheep ha(-1) was found in permanent crops, 1.73 in annual crops, and 1.25 in grassland, 0.88 in grazed forests and 0.84 in shrublands. The GP modelling and mapping could assist in the implementation of herding programmes aimed at reducing fire hazards at a parish or at a regional scale.

TI  - Application of the SBAS-DInSAR technique for deformation monitoring in Tunis City and Mornag plain
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The ground deformation phenomena are the result of the application of natural stress (tectonic) or anthropogenic stress (overexploitation of groundwater, embankment) on the soil. The land deformation may cause several impacts on the environment and human life. A good understanding of the deformation behaviour of the soil is essential to mitigate risks on the infrastructure and environment. In this study, a radar interferometry is carried out to analyse the mobility of an urban and suburban area of Greater Tunis region. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique has been proven to be an effective methodology for detecting and monitoring soil displacement with millimetre accuracy and also, improving our understanding of the current deformations in the study area. Indeed, the application of differential SAR interferometry made it possible to determine the origin of the surface deformations related to natural or anthropic phenomena. In this paper, the interferometric method of small baseline subset (SBAS) developed by Berardino et al. 2002has been chosen, in order to monitor the spatial and temporal pattern of the deformation phenomena in Greater Tunis region. The analysis of Envisat ASAR (2003-2007, descending satellite orbit) and Sentinel 1B (2016-2018, ascending satellite orbit) SAR data allowed us to create deformation velocity maps associated with line of sight displacement time series. The results obtained by this method showed the existence of subsidence phenomenon in the urban areas (Tunis City) as well as in the rural areas (Mornag plain). In the first site (Tunis City), the subsidence rate reaches up to 13.98 mm/year and 19 mm/year during 2003-2007 and 2016-2018, respectively. The ground deformation that is detected around the region of Tunis Lake and Sebkhet Essijoumi, is probably due to the nature of the highly compressible and thickness alluvial deposits and whose substratum depth sometimes reaches more than 60 m. In the second studied site, ground subsidence was identified in the whole plain of Mornag. Indeed, the comparison between piezometric data and time series deformations shows that the trend of soil subsidence is coherent with the dynamic change in groundwater levels. Furthermore, the analysis of velocity deformation, geological data and hydrogeological information allows us to associate all the detected settlement patterns to groundwater overexploitation and compressible alluvium all over the plain. This overexploitation of groundwater in Mornag plain is mainly caused by the expansion of agricultural and industrial activities and the decrease in annual rainfall in recent years (from 2003 to 2018).

AB  - We evaluated novel sentinel node values in breast cancer for one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) to predict further nodal involvement using various methods in clinically node-negative disease with a positive OSNA result and subsequent axillary node dissection. 239 patients (118 macrometastatic) were assessed revealing cutoffs of total tumor load (TTL) 44 500 copies/mu L (AUROC 0.793); average copy number (ACN) 9450 (AUROC 0.790); and highest copy number (HCN) 46,000. For macrometastatic patients only: TTL 221 400 copies/mu L (AUROC 0.685); ACN 64,000 (AUROC 0.671); HCN 59 500 (AUROC 0.529). Our data favor TTL and represent one of the largest OSNA macrometastatic predictive series.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technologies grow drastically in recent years by ecologists around the globe. At present, using sophisticated sensors, there is a massive challenge in handling the high dense remotely captured information with spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric resolutions. This article addresses how to handle such large volume remotely sensed data using R programming with the aid of RStudio. We aim broadly two categories, such as image preprocessing and classification techniques on remotely sensed data. Image preprocessing methods such as false-color composite, pan-sharpening, single event upset error mitigation, and a view on the hyper spectral image. The other category comes with a focus on landscape spatial features analysis and unsupervised classification to analyze vegetation land. The CLARA (Clustering LARge Application) algorithm is used in this study which exploits k-medoids approaches for the unsupervised classification. Also, for results comparison, different vegetation indices such as normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified NDWI (MNDWI), and soil adjusted vegetation index are used for vegetation (land) analysis. Also, for the unsupervised classification, the Silhouette index is used to compare the clustering algorithms.

TI  - Global distribution and 14-year changes in erythemal irradiance, UV atmospheric transmission, and total column ozone for 2005-2018 estimated from OMI and EPIC observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data from the Ozone Measuring Instrument (OMI) and Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) are used to study long-term changes and global distribution of UV erythemal irradiance E(zeta, phi, z, t) (mW m(-2)) and the dimensionless UV index E/(25 m Wm(-2)) over major cities as a function of latitude longitude zeta, altitude phi, and time t. Extremely high amounts of erythemal irradiance (12 < UV index < 18) are found for many low-latitude and high-altitude sites (e.g., San Pedro, Chile, 2.45 km; La Paz, Bolivia, 3.78 km). Lower UV indices at some equatorial or high-altitude sites (e.g., Quito, Ecuador) occur because of persistent cloud effects. High UVI levels (UVI > 6) are also found at most mid-latitude sites during the summer months for clear-sky days. OMI time-series data starting in January 2005 to December 2018 are used to estimate 14-year changes in erythemal irradiance Delta E, total column ozone Delta TCO3, cloud and haze transmission Delta C-T derived from scene reflectivity LER, and reduced transmission from absorbing aerosols Delta C-A derived from absorbing aerosol optical depth tau(A) for 191 specific cities in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere from 60 degrees S to 60 degrees N using publicly available OMI data. A list of the sites showing changes at the 1 standard deviation level 1 sigma is provided. For many specific sites there has been little or no change in E(zeta, phi, z, t) for the period 2005-2018. When the sites are averaged over 15 degrees of latitude, there are strong correlation effects of both short-and long-term cloud and absorbing aerosol change as well as anticorrelation with total column ozone change Delta TCO3. Estimates of changes in atmospheric transmission Delta C-T (zeta, phi, z, t) derived from OMI-measured cloud and haze reflectivity LER and averaged over 15 degrees of latitude show an increase of 1.1 +/- 1.2 % per decade between 60 and 45 degrees S, almost no average 14-year change of 0.03 +/- 0.5 % per decade from 55 degrees S to 30 degrees N, local increases and decreases from 20 to 30 degrees N, and an increase of 1 +/- 0.9 % per decade from 35 to 60 degrees N. The largest changes in E(zeta, phi, z, t) are driven by changes in cloud transmission C-T. Synoptic EPIC radiance data from the sun-lit Earth are used to derive ozone and reflectivity needed for global images of the distribution of E(zeta, phi, z, t)) from sunrise to sunset centered on the Americas, Europe-Africa, and Asia. EPIC data are used to show the latitudinal distribution of E(zeta, phi, z, t) from the Equator to 75 degrees for specific longitudes. EPIC UV erythemal images show the dominating effect of solar zenith angle (SZA), the strong increase in E with altitude, and the decreases caused by cloud cover. The nearly cloud-free images of E(zeta, phi, z, t) over Australia during the summer (December) show regions of extremely high UVI (14-16) covering large parts of the continent. Zonal averages show a maximum of UVI = 14 in the equatorial region seasonally following latitudes where SZA = 0 degrees. Dangerously high amounts of erythemal irradiance (12 < UV index < 18) are found for many low-latitude and high-altitude sites.High levels of UVI are known to lead to health problems (skin cancer and eye cataracts) with extended unprotected expo- sure, as shown in the extensive health statistics maintained by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the United States National Institute of Health National Cancer Institute.

TI  - Accurate extraction of offshore raft aquaculture areas based on a 3D-CNN model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Offshore aquaculture plays an important role in China's marine fishery economy. The research on the extraction of offshore aquaculture areas based on remote sensing technology is of great significance for the regulation of offshore fishery resources and the protection of the marine ecological environment. This paper uses the Gaofen-2 series multispectral remote sensing image to extract the offshore aquaculture areas of Lianyungang City. We use the optimum index factor to extract the spectral features of the aquaculture areas and the grey-level co-occurrence matrix to extract their texture features. We use the Bhattacharyya distance to select the spatial and spectrum features and construct the characteristic data set of the aquaculture areas. In this paper, we propose a method to construct a uniform distributed disturbance term to optimize the cross entropy loss function. We employ it in the three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) model, extract the extended feature data set of aquaculture areas, and input it into the radial basis function support vector machine (RBF-SVM) classifier for classification. Within the study area of 150 km(2), the experimental results show that the extraction model has high extraction accuracy and strong spatial migration despite complex water backgrounds. The F-1-score values in the training area and the four random test areas were 0.939 or above for 2017 data. In addition, the extraction model also has stable time migration. We used the extraction model on remote sensing data for the same study area in 2018 and 2019. The F-1-scores for all test areas are 0.866 or higher. Therefore, the model proposed in this paper is suitable for the extraction of large-scale and multi-temporal offshore raft aquaculture areas from remote sensing images.

TI  - Muslims and non-Muslims intention to hold Shariah-compliant credit cards: a SmartPLS approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC MARKETING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, religiosity, knowledge and Shariah-compliance with intention to hold Shariah-compliant credit card (SCCC) amongst Muslims and non-Muslims.Design/methodology/approach - Researchers used survey questionnaire to collect data and applied a purposive sampling method, then analyzing the data using descriptive statistics and also multi-group analysis of SmartPLS.Findings - For Muslims, attitude, subjective norm, Shariah-compliance, knowledge and religiosity are positively significant. While for non-Muslims, only attitude and subjective norm are positively significant to intention to hold SCCCs.Research limitations/implications - The behavioural study only focusses on intention to hold Islamic credit cards, which is constraining the extended model of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) without the actual performance of the behaviour, which is holding SCCCs. Secondly, the research caters for a single method, namely, quantitative without including the qualitative method to better understand and explore other factors affecting consumers' behavioural intention. The qualitative part can be carried out by conducting interviews with practitioners, regulators and customers. Thirdly, the cultural dimensions are not combined as parts of TPBs' antecedents for extended model that could be affecting intention, as Malaysia has diverse ethnic groups with different religious background.Practical implications - In terms of managerial implications, the findings will further assist financial service providers to develop more effective marketing strategies for Islamic financial products not just to cater for the Muslims but also the non-Muslims, who are increasingly attracted to Islamic banking. As many Muslims are still holding conventional credit cards, it is timely for the Islamic financial institutions to attract themwith the SCCCs. Social implications - Financial marketers are expected to be qualified and well-versed on the different Islamic product structures and also the conventional products. By having such enables them to enlighten and create awareness amongst the targeted consumers in seeking Shariah-compliant financial-related products.Originality/value - The research will contribute to new theoretical knowledge of an extended behavioural model in relation to customers' perception towards SCCCs' acceptance.

TI  - Potential importance of Socotra dragon's blood tree cloud forests and woodlands for capturing horizontal precipitation
T2  - RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of populations of the Socotra dragon's blood trees (Dracaena cinnabariBalf.f., 1882) for horizontal precipitation capture was estimated for the first time. Dragon's blood trees (Asparagaceae) inhabit semiarid cloud forests with low levels of rainfall that strongly depend on additional moisture from fog and clouds. Our estimation was based on a detailed description of the aboveground biomass structure of stands of the dragon's blood trees on Socotra Island. The aboveground biomass was described using non-destructive methods. An example of a well-preserved forest was measured in terms of the basic biometric characteristics of each tree, and the trees were divided into three classes based on crown projections. For each class, we took detailed measurements of one representative tree. All measured and counted growth characteristics were converted to the stand level. The tree population at the whole island level was investigated using remotely sensed data. The estimation of horizontal precipitation was performed using detailed and precise evaluation of the available climate data in half-hour intervals over the period of June 2009 and June 2010 and the ambulatory direct measurements (12.6.2009-26.6.2009). The mean annual horizontal precipitation below the crown of the dragon's blood tree was estimated to be 792 mm in the highest (951-1545 m a.s.l.), 373 mm in the middle (601-950 m a.s.l.) and 46 mm in the lowest (180-600 m a.s.l.) altitudinal zones. Our model showed that the horizontal precipitation exceeded 40% of the total annual precipitation. The decline in the dragon's blood tree forest could therefore cause the loss of additional water from the island's hydrological cycle.

TI  - Estimating changes and trends in ecosystem extent with dense time-series satellite remote sensing
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying trends in ecosystem extent is essential to understanding the status of ecosystems. Estimates of ecosystem loss are widely used to track progress toward conservation targets, monitor deforestation, and identify ecosystems undergoing rapid change. Satellite remote sensing has become an important source of information for estimating these variables. Despite regular acquisition of satellite data, many studies of change in ecosystem extent use only static snapshots, which ignores considerable amounts of data. This approach limits the ability to explicitly estimate trend uncertainty and significance. Assessing the accuracy of multiple snapshots also requires time-series reference data which is often very costly and sometimes impossible to obtain. We devised a method of estimating trends in ecosystem extent that uses all available Landsat satellite imagery. We used a dense time series of classified maps that explicitly accounted for covariates that affect extent estimates (e.g., time, cloud cover, and seasonality). We applied this approach to the Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctuary, Myanmar, where rapid deforestation is greatly affecting the lowland rainforest. We applied a generalized additive mixed model to estimate forest extent from more than 650 Landsat image classifications (1999-2018). Forest extent declined significantly at a rate of 0.274%/year (SE = 0.078). Forest extent declined from 91.70% (SE = 0.02) of the study area in 1999 to 86.52% (SE = 0.02) in 2018. Compared with the snapshot method, our approach improved estimated trends of ecosystem loss by allowing significance testing with confidence intervals and incorporation of nonlinear relationships. Our method can be used to identify significant trends over time, reduces the need for extensive reference data through time, and provides quantitative estimates of uncertainty.

TI  - The roles of criteria, data and classification methods in designing land cover classification systems: evidence from existing land cover data sets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) is a fundamental element and representative feature for any Land Cover Data Set (LCDS). Although various LCCSs have been proposed during the past few decades, discrepancies of LCCSs have widely existed in various LCDSs, which have caused negative impacts on comprehensive comparison and integrated utilization of multiple LCDSs. This study attempted to summarize the independent diagnostic criteria hidden in the existing LCCSs based on the induction method, and to synchronously discover the roles of data sources and classification methods in designing LCCSs. A total of 13 existing regional- or global-scale LCDSs were chosen. The analysis results show that phenology, coverage rate, vertical structure, and leaf type were the most frequently adopted criteria in the LCCSs of existing LCDSs. The decision of whether to adopt a diagnostic criterion in the LCCS of LCDS depended on the availability, effectiveness, and quality of the relevant data sources and classification methods. Currently, optical remote sensing images are still the prominent data source for regional- or global-scale LCDSs, and the potential of each diagnostic criterion could not be fully played. Multi-source and heterogeneous spatial data, ARD (Analysis Ready Data), and a fusion of optical, LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), radar, and other kinds of images have provided practical solutions. A lack of tools with high computing and storage capacities has been an alternative challenge. With the increasing advancement of new technologies, such as big earth data, crowdsourcing, deep learning, and cloud computing, more potential diagnostic criteria may be adopted for designing LCCS, and the richness and flexibility of the LCCS in the planned LCDS will gradually improve. This work not only offers beneficial references and revelations for the design of a new LCCS, but also provides insights for land cover mapping in large regions and the rational utilization of LCDSs.

TI  - Extraction of Bohai Sea ice from MODIS data based on multi-constraint endmembers and linear spectral unmixing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A Linear Spectral Unmixing method based on Multi-Constraint Endmembers (LSU-MCE) is proposed to extract the sea ice in the Bohai Sea using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. The method first extracts the spectral features, texture features, shape features, and temperature features of the sea ice and sea water, and then constructs the rules using the features to purify the endmembers, and finally decomposes the pixels using the linear spectral unmixing method. The method can properly detect sea ice including thin ice, drift ice, and melt ponds. Besides, the turbid sea water is separated from sea water as a separate endmember. So the proposed method can eliminate the disturbance caused by suspended sediment and successfully detect sea ice in high sediment waters. The method has good robustness to MODIS images of different satellites (Terra and Aqua) and the stripe noise. The method has been successfully applied to time series data of MODIS and the results show that it has high accuracy for sea ice detection in the Bohai Sea, with better visual results, and higher overall accuracy and kappa coefficient ().

TI  - Application of low-cost fine particulate mass monitors to convert satellite aerosol optical depth to surface concentrations in North America and Africa
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-cost particulate mass sensors provide opportunities to assess air quality at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. Established traditional monitoring networks have limited spatial resolution and are simply absent in many major cities across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Satellites provide snapshots of regional air pollution but require ground-truthing. Low-cost monitors can supplement and extend data coverage from these sources worldwide, providing a better overall air quality picture. We investigate the utility of such a multi-source data integration approach using two case studies. First, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, both traditional monitoring and dense low-cost sensor networks are compared with satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from NASA's MODIS system, and a linear conversion factor is developed to convert AOD to surface fine particulate matter mass concentration (as PM2.5). With 10 or more ground monitors in Pittsburgh, there is a 2-fold reduction in surface PM2.5 estimation mean absolute error compared to using only a single ground monitor. Second, we assess the ability of combined regional-scale satellite retrievals and local-scale low-cost sensor measurements to improve surface PM2.5 estimation at several urban sites in SSA. In Rwanda, we find that combining local ground monitoring information with satellite data provides a 40% improvement in surface PM2.5 estimation accuracy with respect to using low-cost ground monitoring data alone. A linear AOD-to-surface-PM2.5 conversion factor developed in Kigali, Rwanda, did not generalize well to other parts of SSA and varied seasonally for the same location, emphasizing the need for ongoing and localized groundbased monitoring, which can be facilitated by low-cost sensors. Overall, we find that combining ground-based low-cost sensor and satellite data, even without including additional meteorological or land use information, can improve and expand spatiotemporal air quality data coverage, especially in data-sparse regions.

TI  - Crop biophysical parameter retrieval from Sentinel-1 SAR data with a multi-target inversion of Water Cloud Model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of bio-and geophysical parameters from Earth observation (EO) data is essential for developing applications on crop growth monitoring. High spatio-temporal resolution and wide spatial coverage provided by EO satellite data are key inputs for operational crop monitoring. In Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) applications, a semi-empirical model (viz., Water Cloud Model (WCM)) is often used to estimate vegetation descriptors individually. However, a simultaneous estimation of these vegetation descriptors would be logical given their inherent correlation, which is seldom preserved in the estimation of individual descriptors by separate inversion models. This functional relationship between biophysical parameters is essential for crop yield models, given that their variations often follow different distribution throughout crop development stages. However, estimating individual parameters with independent inversion models presume a simple relationship (potentially linear) between the biophysical parameters. Alternatively, a multi-target inversion approach would be more effective for this aspect of model inversion compared to an individual estimation approach. In the present research, the multi-output support vector regression (MSVR) technique is used for inversion of the WCM from C-band dual-pol Sentinel-1 SAR data. Plant Area Index (PAI, m(2) m(-2)) and wet biomass (W, kg m(-2)) are used as the vegetation descriptors in the WCM. The performance of the inversion approach is evaluated with in-situ measurements collected over the test site in Manitoba (Canada), which is a super-site in the Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) SAR inter-comparison experiment network. The validation results indicate a good correlation with acceptable error estimates (normalized root mean square error-nRMSE and mean absolute error-MAE) for both PAI and wet biomass for the MSVR approach and a better estimation with MSVR than single-target models (support vector regression-SVR). Furthermore, the correlation between PAI and wet biomass is assessed using the MSVR and SVR model. Contrary to the single output SVR, the correlation between biophysical parameters is adequately taken into account in MSVR based simultaneous inversion technique. Finally, the spatio-temporal maps for PAI and W at different growth stages indicate their variability with crop development over the test site.

TI  - Evaluation of Terra/Aqua MODIS and Sentinel-2 MSI NDVI data for predicting actual evapotranspiration in Mediterranean regions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional meteorological data and remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images can be proficiently combined to predict actual evapotranspiration (ETA) on different spatial and temporal scales. Up to now, however, the operational application of this approach in heterogeneous Mediterranean regions has found difficulty due to the insufficient spatial resolution of satellite sensors having high acquisition frequency (i.e. 250 m of Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS). The current study investigates the advantages brought for this objective by the recent availability of NDVI data taken from the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), which has a spatial resolution of 10 m. The investigation has been performed in two Mediterranean areas characterized by different spatio-temporal variability of vegetation cover. The first is a mountain coniferous forest, where such variability is low, while the second is a relatively small (around 10 ha) irrigated tomato field surrounded by other annual crops showing diversified growing cycles. An ETA estimation method based on NDVI data is applied in the two study areas and its performances are evaluated against ground references obtained through the elaboration of site measurements (i.e. meteorological, soil water content, and crop coefficient observations). The advantage of using MSI over MODIS NDVI images is marginal in the first case study, while is evident in the second. More particularly, such advantage is outstanding when the remote sensing method is applied in an operational mode, i.e. without using the information on the water supplied to the tomato crop by irrigation. This confirms that the utility of higher spatial resolution data is dependent not only on the fragmentation of the observed landscapes but also on the synchronicity of major vegetation growing cycles, which is influenced by both environmental and human-induced factors.

TI  - Analysis of past and future multi-temporal land use and land cover changes in the semi-arid Upper-Mzingwane sub-catchment in the Matabeleland south province of Zimbabwe
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyse past spatio-temporal land use and land cover (LULC) change dynamics in the Upper-Mzingwane sub-catchment (UMS) located in the semi-arid Matabeleland south region of Zimbabwe using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (L5-TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (L8-OLI) imagery for the periods of 1989, 2004, 2013, and 2018. We also model plausible future LULC scenarios for UMS. We distinguished five LULC classes, i.e. water, bareland, dense woodland, shrubland, and grassland using a hybrid approach entailing image classification in R-software using the Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Accuracy assessment and Kappa statistics revealed better performance of the SVM hence its outputs were used in the change analysis (i.e. to quantify LULC transitions and trends statistically). We then utilized the TerrSet Land Change Modeller (LCM) (using the Markov Chain algorithm with Multi-Layer Perceptron) to model future LULC scenarios up to 2038 at 5-year intervals. Results revealed that the grass, shrub, and woody vegetation are predominant land covers covering 48.5%, 31.5%, and 18.8% in 1989 and 54.4%, 28.8%, and 15.8%, respectively, in 2018. Dense woodland cover was projected to experience the greatest net loss of 43.57% while shrubland, grassland, water, and bareland increase by 10.73%, 4.5%, 26.85%, and 15.09%, respectively, between 2023 and 2038. We concluded that the UMS has since 1989, been losing and will continue to lose dense woodland cover into the future possibly due to increased human activities such as small scale and illegal gold mining in the area. As such, immediate remedial action needs to be taken to reverse the observed and possible future negative LULC change trends especially for woodland cover so as to avert likely adverse socio-economic, hydrological, and ecological consequences within and beyond the UMS.

TI  - Evaporation rates in a vital lake: a 34-year assessment for the Karaoun Lake
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The evaporation of water is an indispensable process in the earth water cycle. While high rates of evaporation made access to water resources harsher and costlier, monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of the evaporation rates, particularly in an open lake, is critical. Such information would enable to establish adequate management plans focusing on the sustainable use of available water resources. In this research, a vital lake in Lebanon, namely Karaoun or Qaraoun, was investigated. The importance of such reservoir lies in providing, solely, the required water for more than 500 000 households and 19 000 ha of agricultural lands. The evaporation rates were evaluated, both spatially and temporally, between 1985 and 2018 using the widely acknowledged Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) system. This latter is based on 30 m. Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8 satellite images. Main results emphasize the evaporation rates increase over the lake, particularly noticed since 2005. Between 1985 and 2018, the annual mean evaporation rate was 2.24 mm day(-1). More precisely, the annual mean evaporation rate has nearly doubled between 1985-1989 and 2014-2018 periods (i.e. 1.87 vs. 3.12 mm day(-1)). Mann-Kendall test and Sen's Slope estimates were produced to check the significance of the observed trends as well as to investigate the main driving factors behind this increase. Main causes were divided into natural (i.e. significant increase at alpha = 0.001 for temperatures and at alpha = 0.05 for solar radiations) and anthropogenic (i.e. deteriorating water quality) related factors. The most probable future scenario would highlight a fearful increase of 1 degrees C in the next decade and an evaporation rate multiplied one and half times by 2038. These findings should help local management authority to mitigate water quality and turbidity effects, as well as to accurately estimate the water budget in an open-water lake. The concerned government should also benefit from these results to draw clear policies on how to conserve water resources with an increasing global warming trend. Such study could be portable to other regions where evaporation-related datasets are missing.

TI  - Application of machine learning techniques in groundwater potential mapping along the west coast of India
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater potential mapping (GWPM) in the coastal zone is crucial for the planning and development of society and the environment. The current study is aimed to map the groundwater potential zones of Sindhudurg coastal stretch on the west coast of India, using three machine learning models: random forest (RF), boosted regression tree (BRT), and the ensemble of RF and support vector machine (SVM). In order to achieve the objective, 15 groundwater influencing factors including elevation, slope, aspect, slope length (LS), profile curvature, plan curvature, topographical wetness index (TWI), distance from streams, distance from lineaments, lithology, geomorphology, soil, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and rainfall were considered for inter-thematic correlations and overlaid with spring and well occurrences in a spatial database. A total of 165 spring and well locations were identified, which had been divided into two classes: training and validation, at the ratio of 70:30, respectively. The RF, BRT, and RF-SVM ensemble models have been applied to delineate the groundwater potential zones and categorized into five classes, namely very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. RF, BRT, and ensemble model results showed that 33.3%, 35.6%, and 36.8% of the research area had a very high groundwater potential zone. These models were validated with area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve. The accuracy of RF (94%) and hybrid model (93.4%) was more efficient than BRT (89.8%) model. In order to further evaluate and validate, four different sites were subsequently chosen, and we obtained similar results, ensuring the validity of the applied models. Additionally, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) technique was applied to predict the groundwater table and validated by measured wells. The mean difference between measured and GPR predicted groundwater table was 14 cm, which reflected the importance of GPR to guide the location of new wells in the study region. The outcomes of the study will help the decision-makers, government agencies, and private sectors for sustainable planning of groundwater in the area. Overall, the present study provides a comprehensive high-precision machine learning and GPR-based groundwater potential mapping.

TI  - Spatio-temporal changes of green spaces and their impact on urban environment of Mumbai, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of rapid urbanization and climate change, urban green spaces significantly contribute to mitigate the subsequent increasing urban heat island (UHI), particularly to reduce the increasing land surface temperature (LST), aridity and intensity of heat waves through their cooling effects in the surrounding areas. The gradual depletion of urban green spaces, largely due to increasing population pressure and urban expansion, has resulted in the land use land cover change (LULC) and has altered the micro-climate of the urban ecosystem. In this context, the present study has analysed and assessed the changing scale and spatial layout of the urban green spaces using the landsat thematic mapper (TM) and OLI/TIRS remote sensing image data from 1988 and 2018 in Mumbai city. Multiple correlation matrix analysis of LST and NDVI, with 200 sample sites of Mumbai, has been carried out to demonstrate how the LST of green space has been changed to other LULC over the period of three decades. The assessment using various indices like LST, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface emissivity (LSE) and leaf area index (LAI) indicated that there has been drastic transformation of urban green spaces; it has reduced from 46.42% in 1988 to 26.67% in 2018. The areas of LST higher than 30.50 degrees C have dramatically increased from 5232 ha in 1988 to 14,339 ha in 2018. The expanding urbanization has engulfed half of the dense vegetation having > 0.3 NDVI index; it has reduced from 17,406 ha in 1988 to 9910 ha in 2018. Since declining green spaces is a negative indicator to the environment, the policy makers, planners and legislation should emphasize and adopt measures to restore green areas of the Mumbai metropolitan region.

TI  - A multinomial logistic model-based land use and land cover classification for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation nations using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer product
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The land-use and land-cover (LULC) mapping is crucial for the management and planning of a nation. The land use and land cover are the two separate terminologies often used interchangeably. We mapped LULC for the nations of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation represented by Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka covering an area of ca. 5,100,000 km(2). Mapping LULC is a cumbersome process for a larger area; nevertheless, in recent decades the satellite-based Earth observation has provided a great impetus and various approaches have been adopted to map LULC. In this study, we used the multinomial logit model (Mnlogit) to classify Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived time-series data for mapping LULC. The MODIS-archived images for the years 2004-2007 and 2016 were used to map LULC for corresponding years. For the same years, maps were available from IGBP, FAO and NR Census, India, for comparison; hence, these years were selected. The classification of images for each of the years was found to be more consistent and accurate in comparison with the existing LULC maps of IGBP and FAO, and hence a robust approach. The method can be adopted to map global resources. We achieved overall accuracy ranging from 76 to 82% with kappa statistic (K-hat) ranging from 0.64 to 0.73, which is better than previous works. The study demonstrates an effective way to utilize remote sensing data for mapping LULC for a larger area with reasonable accuracy.

TI  - Mapping and monitoring land use and land cover changes in Mellegue watershed using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The supervised classification maximum likelihood was applied in this study. It aimed to visualize the land use/land cover changes in the Mellegue catchment, using multispectral satellite data of Landsat imagery for a specific study period from 2002 to 2018. This classification was built based on ground truth data collected for nine classes. These data were entered subsequently in the ENVI software to operate the classification process. Then, the results were refined using the GIS tool, by ArcGIS software, which required a visual interpretation and expert knowledge of the area. According to the cross-tabulation matrix and classification results, it was found that major changes have occurred during the study period causing serious degradation of the environment and ecosystem.

TI  - Joint probability-based classifier based on vine copula method for land use classification of multispectral remote sensing data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use classification is fundamental both for monitoring and predicting regional development patterns and for planning and regulating land use. This research proposed a joint probability-based classifier for land use classification of multispectral remote sensing data and applied it to the Lake Baiyangdian region of North China. This classifier, based on the vine copula method, was suitable for dealing with the uncertainties of land classification and its random variables that did not necessarily obey predefined distributions. Comparison of the results obtained using the proposed classifier with those derived using the widely used maximum likelihood classifier indicated that the accuracy of land use classification of multispectral remote sensing data was higher with the proposed classifier. Compared with the contingency matrix of the maximum likelihood classifier, that of the vine copula classifier showed an increase in the producer's (user's) accuracy of rural land (shallow water) of 29.4% (30.0%). The proposed classifier increased the shallow water area and significantly reduced the area of rural land. The main reason was the maximum likelihood classifier had poor classification performance, misclassifying pixels of shallow water as rural land. The findings of this study demonstrated that the vine copula classifier performs better than the traditional maximum likelihood classifier and that its application could promote full utilization of remotely sensed data.

TI  - A quantitative model to simulate the vertical errors of SRTM3 DEM V4 data at the pixel level in the Shanbei Plateau of China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Shanbei Plateau is located in the central Loess Plateau of China, which exhibits typical loess geomorphology and suffers serious soil and water erosion. Numerous studies are conducted here using digital topographic analysis methods based on digital elevation model (DEM) datasets. Most of these topographic analyses are conducted at the pixel level; thus, it is meaningful to determine the vertical error distributions of the DEM datasets at that scale. Taking the 14th product of the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System on the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat/GLA14) as the benchmark, the aim of this research is to construct a quantitative model to simulate the vertical error distributions of SRTM3 (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission with a spatial resolution of 3") DEM V4 data for the Shanbei Plateau. Through comparison, the multiple linear regression (MLR) model is chosen and the vertical error surface is determined based on the MLR model and the land surface factor data. Moreover, the rectified SRTM3 DEM V4 data are developed based on the original data version and the vertical error surface. Through accuracy assessment, the root mean squared error (RMSE) value for the rectified version is found to be 9.6 m. Compared to 20.6 m for the original version, this is a clear improvement. Meanwhile, the MLR model has an R-2 (the coefficient of determination) value of 0.484, which shows that it is able to represent the relationships between the vertical error distributions and the land surface factors. This research is not only meaningful for digital topographic analysis and its relevant fields of application but also provides a reference for accuracy assessments of other DEM datasets in different regions.

TI  - Using Prenatal Blood Samples to Evaluate COVID-19 Rapid Serologic Tests Specificity
T2  - MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Background cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses may reduce the specificity of COVID-19 rapid serologic tests. The vast majority of women attend prenatal care, which is a unique source of population-based blood samples appropriate for validation studies. We used stored 2018 serum samples from an existing pregnancy cohort study to evaluate the specificity of COVID-19 serologic rapid diagnostic tests. Methods We randomly selected 120 stored serum samples from pregnant women enrolled in a cohort in 2018 in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, at least 1 year before the COVID-19 pandemic. We used stored serum to evaluate four lateral flow rapid diagnostic tests, following manufacturers' instructions. Pictures were taken for all tests and read by two blinded trained evaluators. Results We evaluated 120, 80, 90, and 90 samples, respectively. Specificity for both IgM and IgG was 100% for the first two tests (95% confidence intervals [CI] 97.0-100 and 95.5-100, respectively). The third test had a specificity of 98.9% (95% CI 94.0-100) for IgM and 94.4% (95% CI 87.5-98.2) for IgG. The fourth test had a specificity of 88.9% (95% CI 80.5-94.5) for IgM and 100% (95% CI 96.0-100) for IgG. Discussion COVID-19 serologic rapid tests are of variable specificity. Blood specimens from sentinel prenatal clinics provide an opportunity to validate serologic tests with population-based samples.

TI  - Surrounding landscape influences the abundance of insect predators in rice field
T2  - BMC ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Natural enemy abundance in a crop plot depends on its prey presence and also influenced by habitats close to field. Landscape changes are also important factors driving pest and natural enemy population abundance in a specific crop field. Examining these kinds of effects on insect pests or biocontrol agents, as well as analysis of their functional food webs, would be asset to make a fruitful pest management programme at local scales. Therefore, this study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of surrounding landscape on the abundance insect predators in rice field. Results This study revealed a dependency on rice bund margin width, with spider populations increasing with increased bund widths. Conversely, population abundance did not rely on the number of weed species observed on earthen ridge around the rice field. In general, relative abundances of predator populations differed significantly across the three landscapes tested. Among the four predators of rice insect pest, the green mirid bug showed highest number irrespective of landscape. Comparatively, higher predator diversity (Shanon diversity) was observed in landscape I followed by landscape III and landscape II. All landscapes showed different diversity indices indicating heterozygosity existed in each study site. These landscape diversity influences the predator's abundances at a local scale. Variogram derived from this study also indicated the landscape heterozygosity existed in studied locations which can also explain the predator's abundances in rice field at locale scale. Conclusion These findings suggest that predators of rice insect pests are landscape specific. Therefore, characterization of each local landscape in Bangladesh rice production landscapes are necessary before planning and implementation of integrated pest management. Geospatial analysis of local landscape would be more effective to analyze such unique characteristics. As a step in this direction, preliminary variography analyses using the RED spectral band of December 2016 LANDSAT 8 imagery propose an initial learning suite of methods for describing useful local characteristics affecting rice pest predators.

TI  - A 36-Year Record of Rock Avalanches in the Saint Elias Mountains of Alaska, With Implications for Future Hazards
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial retreat and mountain-permafrost degradation resulting from rising global temperatures have the potential to impact the frequency and magnitude of landslides in glaciated environments. Several recent events, including the 2015 Taan Fiord rock avalanche, which triggered a tsunami with one of the highest wave runups ever recorded, have called attention to the hazards posed by landslides in regions like southern Alaska. In the Saint Elias Mountains, the presence of weak sedimentary and metamorphic rocks and active uplift resulting from the collision of the Yakutat and North American tectonic plates create landslide-prone conditions. To differentiate between the typical frequency of landsliding resulting from the geologic and tectonic setting of this region, and landslide processes that may be accelerated due to changes in climate, we used Landsat imagery to create an inventory of rock avalanches in a 3700 km(2)area of the Saint Elias Mountains. During the period from 1984 to 2019, we identified 220 rock avalanches with a mean recurrence interval of 60 days. We compared our landslide inventory with a catalog ofM >= 4 earthquakes to identify potential coseismic events, but only found three possible earthquake-triggered rock avalanches. We observed a distinct temporal cluster of 41 rock avalanches from 2013 through 2016 that correlated with above average air temperatures (including the three warmest years on record in Alaska, 2014-2016); this cluster was similar to a temporal cluster of recent rock avalanches in nearby Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. The majority of rock avalanches initiated from bedrock ridges in probable permafrost zones, suggesting that ice loss due to permafrost degradation, as opposed to glacial thinning, could be a dominant factor contributing to rock-slope failures in the high elevation areas of the Saint Elias Mountains. Although earthquake-triggered landslides have episodically occurred in southern Alaska, evidence from our study suggests that area-normalized rates of non-coseismic rock avalanches were greater during the period from 1964 to 2019, and that the frequency of these events will continue to increase as the climate continues to warm. These findings highlight the need for hazard assessments in Alaska that address changes in landslide patterns related to climate change.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Mapping and Monitoring of Mangrove Forests Changes From 1990 to 2019 in the Northern Emirates, UAE Using Random Forest, Kernel Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes Tree Models
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are acting as a green lung for the coastal cities of the United Arab Emirates, providing a habitat for wildlife, storing blue carbon in sediment and protecting shoreline. Thus, the first step toward conservation and a better understanding of the ecological setting of mangroves is mapping and monitoring mangrove extent over multiple spatial scales. This study aims to develop a novel low-cost remote sensing approach for spatiotemporal mapping and monitoring mangrove forest extent in the northern part of the United Arab Emirates. The approach was developed based on random forest (RF), Kernel logistic regression (KLR), and Naive Bayes Tree machine learning algorithms which use multitemporal Landsat images. Our results of accuracy metrics include accuracy, precision, and recall, F1 score revealed that RF outperformed the KLR and NB with an F1 score of more than 0.90. Each pair of produced mangrove maps (1990-2000, 2000-2010, 2010-2019, and 1990-2019) was used to image difference algorithm to monitor mangrove extent by applying a threshold ranges from +1 to -1. Our results are of great importance to the ecological and research community. The new maps presented in this study will be a good reference and a useful source for the coastal management organization.

TI  - Remote sensing image classification based on adaptive ant colony algorithm
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aimed at solving the existing problems in most traditional classification algorithms applied in hyper-spectral classification, such as low speed, low accuracy, and difficult convergence, a hyper-spectral image classification based on an adaptive ant colony algorithm (ACA) is proposed in this paper. First of all, training samples are used to construct the paths selected by ants, and rule pruning is used to prune the paths irrelevant to classification and adaptively update paths. Then, the constructed paths are used to classify the hyper-spectral data. Finally, an accuracy evaluation of the classification is conducted. The hyper-spectral remote sensing data of Washington, D.C., was used to test the method. The method was also compared with principal component analysis (PCA), radial basis function (RBF) neural network, semi-supervised sparse discriminate embedding (SSDE), and adaptive sparse representation (ASP). Results show that the overall classification accuracy increases by about 7.6% using the adaptive ant colony algorithm compared with other algorithms, which improves the classification accuracy of hyper-spectral images efficiently.

TI  - Paraphrasing away properties with pluriverse counterfactuals
T2  - SYNTHESE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, I argue that for the purposes of ordinary reasoning, sentences about properties of concrete objects can be replaced with sentences concerning how things in our universe would be related to inscriptions were there a pluriverse. Speaking loosely, pluriverses are composites of universes that collectively realize every way a universe could possibly be. As such, pluriverses exhaust all possible meanings that inscriptions could take. Moreover, because universes necessarily do not influence one another, our universe would not be any different intrinsically if there were a pluriverse. These two facts enable anti-realists about abstract objects to replace, e.g. talk of anatomical features with talk of the inscriptions concerning anatomical structure that would exist were there a pluriverse. The availability of such replacements enables anti-realists to carry out essential ordinary reasoning without referring to properties, thereby making room for a consistent anti-realist worldview. The inscriptions of the would-be pluriverse are so numerous and varied that sentences about them can play the roles in ordinary reasoning served by simple sentences about properties of concrete objects.

TI  - Cloud phase characteristics over Southeast Asia from A-Train satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the climatology of cloud phase over Southeast Asia (SEA) based on A-Train satellite observations. Using the combined CloudSat-CALIPSO (CC) data, five main cloud groups are investigated: ice-only, ice-above-liquid, liquid-only, ice-above-mixed, and mixed-only clouds that have annual mean frequencies of 28.6 %, 20.1 %, 16.0 %, 9.3 %, and 6.7 %, respectively. Liquid-only clouds tend to occur in relatively cold, dry, and stable lower troposphere. The other four cloud groups appear more frequently in relatively warm, humid, and unstable conditions, and their seasonal distributions move with the Asian monsoon and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Liquid clouds are found to be highly inhomogeneous based on the heterogeneity index (H-sigma) from Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), while ice-only and mixed-only clouds are often very smooth. Ice-above-liquid clouds are more heterogeneous than ice-only clouds owing to ice clouds being optically thin. We demonstrate that the distribution of clear-sky H-sigma has a long tail towards heterogeneous values that are caused by undetected sub-pixel cloud within both CC and MODIS datasets. The reflectance at 0.645 mu m (R-0.645) and brightness temperature at 11 mu m (BT11) of CC ice-only, liquid-only, and ice-above-liquid clouds show peak frequencies near that of clear sky (R-0.645 similar to 0.02; BT11 similar to 294 K), which explains why up to 30 % of these CC cloud groups are classified as clear by MODIS. In contrast, mixed-only clouds are thick (average top similar to 13 km), bright (average R-0.645 similar to 0.6), and cold (average BT11 similar to 234 K). Cloud phase comparison between CC and MODIS reveals only modest agreement, with the best agreement (73 %) occurring between CC ice-above-mixed and MODIS ice clouds. The intraseasonal and interannual behaviors of the all-sky H-sigma and spectral signatures follow that of cloud phase and vary with the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases.

TI  - Metal Concentrations and Source Apportionment of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Chiang Rai and Bangkok, Thailand during a Biomass Burning Season
T2  - ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the persistent environmental problems in the provinces of northern Thailand is severe air pollution during the dry season because of open vegetation burning by farmers for land clearance purpose. Aerosol optical depth and Angstrom exponent data from MODIS-Terra satellite indicated that from mid-March to April, 2019, entire Thailand was covered with a high concentration of fine-sized aerosols. Trace metal concentrations of PM2.5 collected from Chiang Rai in northern Thailand and Bangkok in southern Thailand between January and April 2019 were analyzed. Average concentrations of crustal metals such as Al, Ca, and Fe are higher in Chiang Rai compared to that in Bangkok. The Fe/Al ratio in Chiang Rai decreases from 1.65 during the onset of haze to 0.87 during the peak haze approaching a crustal ratio of 0.48. In contrast, Bangkok has higher Na, Mg, and Zn with an average Na/Mg ratio of 6.07 indicative of a sea spray (Na/Mg similar to 8) origin. Principal component analysis identifies three possible sources in Chiang Rai: (1) crustal dust and biomass burning, (2) industrial source, and (3) refuse incineration mixed with road dust; and for Bangkok (1) natural background, industrial emissions, and coal combustion, (2) traffic emission, and (3) sea spray. The ranges of Pb isotope ratios in the bulk fraction of PM2.5 in Chiang Rai (Pb-206/Pb-207 = 1.1445-1.1657 and Pb-208/Pb-207 = 2.4244-2.4468) and Bangkok (Pb-206/Pb-207 = 1.1343-1.1685 and Pb-208/Pb-207 = 2.4138-2.4450) are not significantly different. However, in a time series plot, Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios in Chiang Rai follow PM2.5 during the peak burning season and correlate well with the Al/Pb (r(2) = 0.61) ratios, indicating that at least part of the Pb is derived from crustal dust during peak fire. Using a binary mixing model, the most radiogenic Pb isotopes in Chiang Rai during the peak haze can be explained by similar to 5 to 30% mixing of crustal dust with similar to 35-40% biomass burning generated aerosols with the background. From the trace metal systematics and Pb isotope ratios, it is evident that (1) during the biomass burning season, trace metals from Chiang Rai are not transported down south to Bangkok and (2) in addition to metals released from biomass burning, the raging fire remobilizes crustal dust that forms an important source of Pb and other trace metals in the Chiang Rai aerosol.

TI  - The Copernicus Polar Ice and Snow Topography Altimeter (CRISTAL) high-priority candidate mission
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Polar Ice and Snow Topography Altimeter (CRISTAL) mission is one of six high-priority candidate missions (HPCMs) under consideration by the European Commission to enlarge the Copernicus Space Component. Together, the high-priority candidate missions fill gaps in the measurement capability of the existing Copernicus Space Component to address emerging and urgent user requirements in relation to monitoring anthropogenic CO2 emissions, polar environments, and land surfaces. The ambition is to enlarge the Copernicus Space Component with the high-priority candidate missions in the mid-2020s to provide enhanced continuity of services in synergy with the next generation of the existing Copernicus Sentinel missions. CRISTAL will carry a dual-frequency synthetic-aperture radar altimeter as its primary payload for measuring surface height and a passive microwave radiometer to support atmospheric corrections and surface-type classification. The altimeter will have interferometric capabilities at Kuband for improved ground resolution and a second (non-interferometric) Ka-band frequency to provide information on snow layer properties. This paper outlines the user consultations that have supported expansion of the Copernicus Space Component to include the high-priority candidate missions, describes the primary and secondary objectives of the CRISTAL mission, identifies the key contributions the CRISTAL mission will make, and presents a concept - as far as it is already defined - for the mission payload.

TI  - Wide discrepancies in the magnitude and direction of modeled solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence in response to light conditions
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent successes in passive remote sensing of far-red solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) have spurred the development and integration of canopy-level fluorescence models in global terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) for climate and carbon cycle research. The interaction of fluorescence with photochemistry at the leaf and canopy scales provides opportunities to diagnose and constrain model simulations of photosynthesis and related processes, through direct comparison to and assimilation of tower, airborne, and satellite data. TBMs describe key processes related to the absorption of sunlight, leaf-level fluorescence emission, scattering, and reabsorption throughout the canopy. Here, we analyze simulations from an ensemble of process-based TBM-SIF models (SiB3 - Simple Bio-sphere Model, SiB4, CLM4.5 - Community Land Model, CLM5.0, BETHY - Biosphere Energy Transfer Hydrology, ORCHIDEE - Organizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems, and BEPS - Boreal Ecosystems Productivity Simulator) and the SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation Photosynthesis Energy) canopy radiation and vegetation model at a subalpine evergreen needleleaf forest near Niwot Ridge, Colorado. These models are forced with local meteorology and analyzed against tower-based continuous far-red SIF and gross-primary-productivity-partitioned (GPP) eddy covariance data at diurnal and synoptic scales during the growing season (July-August 2017). Our primary objective is to summarize the site-level state of the art in TBM-SIF modeling over a relatively short time period (summer) when light, canopy structure, and pigments are similar, setting the stage for regional- to global-scale analyses. We find that these models are generally well constrained in simulating photosynthetic yield but show strongly divergent patterns in the simulation of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), absolute GPP and fluorescence, quantum yields, and light response at the leaf and canopy scales. This study highlights the need for mechanistic modeling of non-photochemical quenching in stressed and unstressed environments and improved the representation of light absorption (APAR), distribution of light across sunlit and shaded leaves, and radiative transfer from the leaf to the canopy scale.

TI  - Enterocyte-Based Bioassay via Quantitative Combination of Proinflammatory Sentinels Specific to 8-keto-trichothecenes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Type B 8-keto-trichothecenes are muco-active mycotoxins that exist as inevitable contaminants in cereal-based foodstuffs. Gut-associated inflammation is an early frontline response during human and animal exposure to these mycotoxins. Despite various tools for chemical identification, optimized biomonitoring of sentinel response-associated biomarkers is required to assess the specific proinflammatory actions of 8-keto-trichothecenes in the gut epithelial barrier. In the present study, intoxication with 8-keto-trichothecenes in human intestinal epithelial cells was found to trigger early response gene 1 product (EGR-1) that plays crucial roles in proinflammatory chemokine induction. In contrast, epithelial exposure to 8-keto-trichothecenes resulted in downregulated expression of nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p65 protein, a key transcription factor, during general inflammatory responses in the gut. Based on the early molecular patterns of expression, the inflammation-inducing activity of 8-keto-trichothecenes was quantified using intestinal epithelial cells with dual reporters for EGR-1 and p65 proteins. EGR-1-responsive elements were linked to luciferase reporter while p65 promoter was bound to secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter. In response to conventional inflammagens such as endotoxins and cytokines such as TNF-alpha, both luciferase and SEAP activity were elevated in a dose-dependent manner. However, as expected from the mechanistic evaluation, 8-keto-trichothecene-exposed dual reporters of luciferase and SEAP displayed contrasting expression patterns. Furthermore, 8-keto-trichothecene-elevated EGR-1-responsive luciferase activity was improved by deficiency of PSMA3, an alpha-type subunit of the 20S proteasome core complex for ubiquitin-dependent EGR-1 degradation. This molecular event-based dual biomonitoring in epithelial cells is a promising supplementary tool for detecting typical molecular inflammatory pathways in response to 8-keto-trichothecenes in the food matrix.

TI  - Remote Sensing Retrieval of Isoprene Concentrations in the Southern Ocean
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Isoprene produced by marine phytoplankton acts as a precursor of secondary organic aerosol and thereby affects cloud formation and brightness over the remote oceans. Yet the marine isoprene emission is poorly constrained, with discrepancies among estimates that reach 2 orders of magnitude. Here we present ISOREMS, the first satellite-only based algorithm for the retrieval of isoprene concentration in the Southern Ocean. Sea surface concentrations from six cruises were matched with remotely sensed variables from MODIS Aqua, and isoprene was best predicted by multiple linear regression with chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature. Climatological (2002-2018) isoprene distributions computed with ISOREMS revealed high concentrations in coastal and near-island waters, and within the 40-50 degrees S latitudinal band. Isoprene seasonality paralleled phytoplankton productivity, with annual maxima in summer. The annual Southern Ocean emission of isoprene was estimated at 63 Gg C yr(-1). The algorithm can provide spatially and temporally realistic inputs to atmospheric and climate models.

TI  - Enhanced flood mapping using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, hydraulic modelling, and social media: A case study of Hurricane Harvey (Houston, TX)
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Post event flooding maps are currently extracted from synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and/or optical satellite images or developing using hydraulic model simulations. Several sources of uncertainties impact the accuracy of such flood maps constructed from each method, especially in urban areas. An integrated approach that combines satellite imagines of flooded areas, hydraulic models, and markers from social media that should reduce these uncertainties and allow a more accurate reconstruction of flooded urban areas, is presented in this paper. The flooding associated with Hurricane Harvey in Houston, TX was chosen as a case study. Model validations demonstrate the effectiveness of our integrated approach in reconstructing an accurate flooding map, as well as the temporal and spatial patterns of flooding. Using the experience from this case study we discuss the possibility to use satellite data, instead of ground-based rainfall gauge measurements as precipitation inputs to the hydraulic model; and possible error sources in simulating flooding in urban areas using the hydraulic model.

TI  - Source routing and detection of dust storm in the Salt Lake basin of Qom in Iran
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decades, the frequency of dust storms has increasingly emerged in the central regions of Iran. This study investigated the SDS sources in the Salt Lake basin of Qom using daily visibility, wind speed, dust weather codes and NCEP/NCAR data, and MODIS and Sentinel-1 sensor datasets. Sample SDS days were selected by daily visibility and dust weather codes with 3-h interval ranging from 2000 to 2017. These sample SDS days were related to the 19 synoptic stations of the Salt Lake basin. Dust entry trajectories were determined through the HYSPLIT model and evaluated with the MODIS Deep Blue aerosol optical depth and atmospheric patterns. SDS sources were identified using Sentinel-1 radar images of IW mode and SLC type through radar interferometry technique. Analysis of variability and frequency in dusty days and wind speed indicated that in high wind speed and dusty days, frequency increases in the second half of the course. SDS entry trajectories indicated that the SDS mainly entered in the study area during April and May from Iraq and eastern Syria and also during June and July from the east of Iran and the study basin. Study of the regional atmospheric circulation represented that the thermodynamic relationship between the thermal low pressure and trough at 500 hPa in spring provides instability and ascending air in Iraq and eastern Syria. In summer, the pressure gradient between thermal low pressure in the east of Iran and the Caspian high pressure intensifies the wind in the eastern part of Iran from the surface to 850 hPa level. Investigation of the dust pickup areas with radar interferometry technique revealed that as far as Iraq and eastern Syria were concerned, the eastern part of Al-Anbar province in the western desert of Iraq was the first source, desert areas in central and southern Iraq were the second source, and the eastern part of Syria ranked the third source of dust. In Iran, the main sources of SDS are located in the eastern regions of the Salt Lake basin as newfound region, the southeastern areas of Semnan province, the northwest of Yazd, and the northeast of Isfahan in the central desert of Iran. In recent years, there has been more abundance of dust originated from the eastern SDS trajectories.

TI  - Asymmetric Development of Auroral Surges in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simultaneous eastward and westward traveling surges were observed at Tjornes, Iceland, and Syowa station, Antarctica, respectively. Several remarkable differences were identified. (1) The position of the initial bright spot was shifted by 1.7 to 2.3 MLT between both hemispheres. (2) The surges differ in traveling speed between the eastward traveling surge (6.5 km s(-1)) and the westward traveling surge (1.3 km s(-1)). (3) The Arase satellite was located on a geomagnetic field line connecting both ground stations and observed a significant excess in westward component of the magnetic field, which is consistent with the large shifts of the initial bright spots in both hemispheres. (4) The background Hall current flows eastward (Northern Hemisphere) and westward (Southern Hemisphere). The observed north-south asymmetry of the traveling surges suggests that the ionosphere can play an essential role in controlling the fundamental spatiotemporal development of auroras in both hemispheres.

TI  - Modeling Spatial Heterogeneity in Surface Turbulent Heat Flux in the US Southern Great Plains
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in numerical modeling of cloud dynamics are driving a need for improved land model prediction at convective storm scales. In this study, satellite and ground-based vegetation remote sensing data were combined with land model experiments to more accurately characterize land surface spatial heterogeneity in the Community Land Model (CLM4.0). The new subgrid classification of plant functional types (PFT) and leaf area index (LAI) enables consistent comparison between models and ground-based flux measurements in the U.S. southern Great Plains. Errors in vegetation data sets (inferred from comparison between 250 m satellite and ground-based LAI), while large, had less impact on the simulated characteristics of spatial heterogeneity compared to errors in model representation of surface energy partitioning (between latent and sensible heat flux) and its relationship to LAI. Predicted spatial heterogeneity in surface energy partitioning was enhanced after replacing soil and stomatal resistance parameters with a new set that better predicts the observed relationship to LAI. These modifications increase the number of smaller (mesoscale) dry land patches having higher sensible heat flux. The parameter experiments suggest that vegetation state and processes (transpiration) act to broaden the size spectrum of surface heat flux heterogeneity, which can influence clouds and convective initiation. Moreover, improvements in vegetation input data and model parameters had partially compensating effects on surface flux heterogeneity, indicating the importance of evaluating input data and parameterizations together to improve prediction at higher spatial resolutions.

TI  - An Adjusted Two-Leaf Light Use Efficiency Model for Improving GPP Simulations Over Mountainous Areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, light use efficiency (LUE) models have been widely used for calculating gross primary productivity (GPP). Unfortunately, these models are only suitable for flat areas without considering the topographic effects on plant photosynthesis. In this study, considering the topographic controls on direct radiation, diffuse radiation, and sunlit canopy area, an adjusted model called mountainous two-leaf (MTL)-LUE is developed from the original two-leaf LUE model (TL-LUE) to improve the GPP simulations in mountainous areas. The MTL-LUE model was validated at an eddy covariance (EC) site with apparent topography in the carbon footprint area. Results showed that the daily GPP simulations from MTL-LUE (root mean square error = 1.29 gC m(-2) d(-1)) matched better with EC GPP than those from the TL-LUE model (root mean square error = 1.84 gC m(-2) d(-1)), confirming the improvement of the MTL-LUE model in mountainous areas. Moreover, results also indicated that the MTL-LUE-simulated GPP showed obvious spatial variations in the study area, suggesting that the MTL-LUE model could characterize the effects of topography on plant photosynthesis. More specifically, canopy GPP was found to decrease when slope increased in shaded terrains and has no obvious variations in different slope ranges when exposed to the sun. Furthermore, results also indicated that a moderate increase in canopy GPP would be expected when the sky clearness decreased, which depended on the gap between the GPP increase of shaded leaves and the GPP decrease of sunlit leaves. This study highlights the potential of the MTL-LUE model in improving GPP simulations in mountainous areas.

TI  - Multi-scale process modelling and distributed computation for spatial data
T2  - STATISTICS AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent years have seen a huge development in spatial modelling and prediction methodology, driven by the increased availability of remote-sensing data and the reduced cost of distributed-processing technology. It is well known that modelling and prediction using infinite-dimensional process models is not possible with large data sets, and that both approximate models and, often, approximate-inference methods, are needed. The problem of fitting simple global spatial models to large data sets has been solved through the likes of multi-resolution approximations and nearest-neighbour techniques. Here we tackle the next challenge, that of fitting complex, nonstationary, multi-scale models to large data sets. We propose doing this through the use of superpositions of spatial processes with increasing spatial scale and increasing degrees of nonstationarity. Computation is facilitated through the use of Gaussian Markov random fields and parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo based on graph colouring. The resulting model allows for both distributed computing and distributed data. Importantly, it provides opportunities for genuine model and data scalability and yet is still able to borrow strength across large spatial scales. We illustrate a two-scale version on a data set of sea-surface temperature containing on the order of one million observations, and compare our approach to state-of-the-art spatial modelling and prediction methods.

TI  - Machine learning methods' performance in radiative transfer model inversion to retrieve plant traits from Sentinel-2 data of a mixed mountain forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of vegetation biochemical and biophysical variables is useful when developing indicators for biodiversity monitoring and climate change studies. Here, we compared a radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion by merit function and five machine learning algorithms trained on an RTM simulated dataset predicting the three plant traits leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC), and leaf area index (LAI), in a mixed temperate forest. The accuracy of the retrieval methods in predicting these three plant traits with spectral data from Sentinel-2 acquired on 13 July 2017 over Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, was evaluated usingin situmeasurements collected contemporaneously. The RTM inversion using merit function resulted in estimations of LCC (R-2 = 0.26, RMSE = 3.9 mu g/cm(2)), CCC (R-2 = 0.65, RMSE = 0.33 g/m(2)), and LAI (R-2 = 0.47, RMSE = 0.73 m(2)/m(2)), comparable to the estimations based on the machine learning method Random forest regression of LCC (R-2 = 0.34, RMSE = 4.06 mu g/cm(2)), CCC (R-2 = 0.65, RMSE = 0.34 g/m(2)), and LAI (R-2 = 0.47, RMSE = 0.75 m(2)/m(2)). Several of the machine learning algorithms also yielded accuracies and robustness similar to the RTM inversion using merit function. The performance of regression methods trained on synthetic datasets showed promise for fast and accurate mapping of plant traits accross different plant functional types from remote sensing data.

TI  - Quantification of long-range transported aeolian dust towards the Indian peninsular region using satellite and ground-based data - A case study during a dust storm over the Arabian Sea
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arabian Sea is an enclosed basin surrounded by land and is prone to receive large amount of aeolian dust from the continent. This can significantly impact surface water biogeochemical processes. In this study, an attempt has been made to quantify the amount of dust transported from Middle East region to Indian subcontinent (sampling site is Goa; 15.45 degrees N 73.80 degrees E; located in the northeast Arabian Sea) via the Arabian Sea. We identified a dust storm episode (02-10 April 2015) in the Arabian Peninsula and its propagation to the study site (Goa) using satellite data (MODIS and CALIPSO). The impact of the dust storm at Goa has been computed using ambient particulate matter concentration and satellite retrieved optical parameter. These observations were further substantiated using ground-based micro-pulse lidar measurement. The daily averaged lidar profile shows relatively high depolarization ratio (0.1-0.25), as well as high daily average backscatter coefficient (up to 0.08 Sr-1 Km(-1)) and extinction coefficient (up to 0.9 Km(-1)) during the storm period compared to non-dusty days. During this period, a two-layer (rich in non-spherical particle) structure with significantly high linear depolarization ratio is observed, indicating the impact of the dust storm at the coastal region of India. Ambient mass concentration of dust estimated using CALIPSO profile are comparable with the gravimetric mass measured from high volume sample collection. The back-trajectory analysis further supports the advection of air-mass from the Middle East to Eastern Arabian Sea. This study highlight the significant role of long-range transport in impacting dust load at the remote/receptor sites.

TI  - A comparative analysis of day and night land surface temperature in two semi-arid cities using satellite images sampled in different seasons
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) refers to the occurrence of very high temperature patches in urban areas with respect to surrounding rural areas. The behaviour of Land Surface Temperature (LST) with different land covers varies for day and night time in a given urban area. Therefore, an attempt has been made for the comparative analysis of the day and night LST in two semi-arid cities in India i.e. Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar using two Landsat 8 images (one for day and one for night time) for each city. The relations of day and night LST with three independent variables such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and impervious surface fraction (ISF) were established using Landsat 8 data. Based on the relation of LST with indices, the combinations of indices were used for developing the models to improve the correlation of day and night LST with the land cover. The developed models improved the correlation of day and night LST with the combinations of indices as compared to the relation of LST with individual variables in semi-arid urban landscapes with reasonably good coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.63 in Ahmedabad and 0.79 in Gandhinagar for day time. The reasonably good values of R-2 were found to be 0.81 and 0.75 for Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, respectively, for night time. The developed model was also evaluated using 12 MODIS satellite images i.e. six images of each city for the summer, post-monsoon and winter seasons (one for day and one for night time in each season). The results of the developed models showed high capability to explain LST in heterogeneous semi-arid urban area for both day and night time in the summer, post-monsoon and winter seasons in a year. However, the relations established in this study can further be investigated for other months and years to understand its significance for other dates in semi-arid urban areas. (C) 2020 COSPAR.

TI  - Evaluation of models to determine LAI on poplar stands using spectral indices from Sentinel-2 satellite images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is one of the most important structural and functional attributes of forests. This is determined by indirect methods such as digital hemispheric photography (DHP), because is simple to use at the field level, but it does not reflect the spatial variability of forest stands at a larger scale. Therefore, there is increasing interest for using satellite images to estimate LAI. This study aims to calibrate and validate models for LAI in Populus x canadensis Moench. (P. deltoides x P. nigra) stands based on two spectral indices, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) obtained from Sentinel-2. The experiment was carried out in poplar stands established in the Maule Region, Chile. The reference LAI was obtained using DHP and was regressed against the spectral index through a linear, quadratic and sum of sine models. Within the study, the linear models for both indices presented the lowest adjustment parameters with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) close to 0.3 and R-2 less than 0.5. On the other hand, the quadratic models and sum of sine for the SAVI were higher than NDVI, with R-2 of 0.57, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.22, RMSE of 0.25 and for the 1:1 ratio, the slope of the curve is 0.99. Despite the homogeneity observed at the field level and the sources of error, this study showed a good degree of adjustment for the quadratic and sum of sine models for determining LAI. These models are presented as an excellent tool to estimate LAI large area of poplar.

TI  - Urban sprawl assessment in Raipur and Bhubaneswar urban agglomerations from 1991 to 2018 using geoinformatics
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid urban growth after India's economic liberalization is likely to foster urban sprawl in mid-sized cities. Therefore, this paper attempts to assess the urban sprawl in Raipur and Bhubaneswar urban agglomerations, fast-growing mid-sized Indian cities. Based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS), multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery from 1991 to 2018 was extracted for land cover change detection and urban sprawl assessment. Shannon's entropy index was employed to detect urban sprawl, while its typologies were quantified using the neighborhood relationship approach. The economic policies and urban development schemes adopted after the economic liberalization were discussed to understand its implication on the urban growth pattern of the two cities. The overall results confirm the loss of agriculture, water body, and fallow land cover due to rapid urban expansion. The population density of Raipur was comparatively higher than Bhubaneswar; however, the former exhibited a decreasing trend. The entropy index indicated the prevalence of urban sprawl in both cities. The assessment of urban sprawl typologies revealed the expansion of secondary urban core and urban fringe towards the peripheral areas during the study period. The research recommends the implementation of urban growth containment strategies to control urban sprawl.

TI  - Comparison of MODIS-based vegetation indices and methods for winter wheat green-up date detection in Huanghuai region of China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite vegetation index (VI) time series data provide a feasible option for monitoring crop phenology at a large scale. However, there are limited researches that investigated the accuracy of different methods for crop phenology detection with various VIs over a large-scale region. In this study, we used four VIs, i.e. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2), and Normalized Difference Phenology Index (NDPI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, combined with six methods, i.e. relative threshold at 10%, 20% or 50% of the VI's amplitude (RT10, RT20 and RT50), maxima of the curvature change rate of the fitted logistic curve (CCRmax), maxima of the first derivation of the VI curve (beta(max)), and cross-correlogram spectral matching-phenology (CCSM-P), to detect winter wheat green-up dates (GUDs) for the period of 2009-2013 in the Huanghuai winter wheat region of China. The performance of the combinations of these methods and VIs was evaluated using ground-observed GUDs from agrometeorological stations with correlation coefficient (r), regression coefficient (a), root mean square error (RMSE) and bias. We further investigated the spatial trend of residuals from a linear model between satellite- and ground-observed GUDs. Results show that NDPI outperforms the other VIs with the highest consistency with ground data in the whole region. RT10, CCRmax and CCSM-P show higher accuracy in the northern region, while in the southern region, RT20 shows relatively higher accuracy in the case of poor performance of all six methods. However, the residuals of these six methods based on NDPI show significantly positive correlations with latitude in the whole region, suggesting an uneven spatial distribution of accuracy with a tendency of underestimating GUDs at the low latitude region and overestimating GUDs at the high latitude region when applying the same method to detect GUDs over a large-scale region. It is suggested to develop a new method or combine several methods to reduce the spatial incoherence of residuals.

TI  - Coastline variability of several Latin American cities alongside Pacific Ocean due to the unusual "Sea Swell" events of 2015
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to report the short-term coastline dynamics and inundation limits of coastal cities along the Eastern Pacific due to the sea swell events that occurred during April to May 2015. The multi-temporal satellite datasets from Landsat such as Enhanced Thematic Mapper (L7 ETM+) and Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (L8 OLI/TIRS) of different periods before and after the swell events were used to identify the shoreline changes. The satellite images were pre-processed using ERDAS imagine 9.2, and the coastline was digitized in ArcGIS 10.4.1 for ten cities spread across from Mexico to Chile (in Pacific coast) using the spectral water indices, and the shoreline change rate and erosion/accretion pattern at each transect were estimated using the statistical parameters embedded in Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). The maximum erosion and accretion were observed in El Salvador (268 m) and Huatulco (Mexico) (115 m), respectively. Likewise, the maximum inundation was observed in El Salvador with 268 m and Acapulco (Mexico) with 254 m, and the tide gauge data suggest a possible relation to the bathymetry and the geomorphological conditions of the coast. Overall, the results indicate that the Eastern Pacific Ocean side sea swell events has led to extreme coastal flooding in recent years due to the increase in the mean sea level and the unpredictable variation in El Nino/Southern Oscillation events.

TI  - Central Review of Radiation Therapy Planning Among Patients with Breast-Conserving Surgery: Results from a Quality Assurance Process Integrated into the INSEMA Trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: After publication of the radiation field design in the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial, a radiation therapy quality assurance review was integrated into the Intergroup-Sentinel-Mamma (INSEMA) trial. We aimed to investigate the role of patient characteristics, extent of axillary surgery, and radiation techniques for dose distribution in ipsilateral axillary levels.Methods and Materials: INSEMA (NCT02466737) has randomized 5542 patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery. Of these, 276 patients from 108 radiation therapy facilities were included in the central review, using the planning records of the first 3 patients treated at each site.Results: Of the 276 patients, 41 had major deviations (ie, no axillary contouring or submission of insufficient records) leading to exclusion. A total of 235 (85.1%) radiation therapy planning records were delineated according to the INSEMA protocol, including 9 (3.8%) cases with minor deviations. At least 25% of INSEMA patients were unintentionally treated with >= 95% of the prescribed breast radiation dose in axillary level I. Approximately 50% of patients were irradiated with a median radiation dose of more than 85% of prescription dose in level I. Irradiated volumes and applied doses were significantly lower in levels II and III compared with level I. However, 25% of patients still received a median radiation dose of >= 75% of prescription dose to level II. Subgroup analysis revealed a significant association between incidental radiation dose in the axilla and obesity. Younger age, boost application, and fractionation schedule showed no impact on axillary dose distribution.Conclusions: Assuming >= 80% of prescribed breast dose as the optimal dose for curative radiation of low-volume disease in axillary lymph nodes, at least 50% of reviewed INSEMA patients received an adequate dose in level I, even with contemporary 3-dimensional techniques. Dose coverage was much less in axillary levels II and III, and far below therapeutically relevant doses. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A large long-lived central-vent volcano in the Gardner region: Implications for the volcanic history of the nearside of the Moon
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large shield-building volcanic structures (>30 km) with central vents are rare on the Moon. The most popular candidate targets of lunar large shield volcanoes are volcanic complexes on the lunar nearside within the compositionally evolved Procellarum KREEP terrane (PKT). However, there is a unique mass concentrated volcanic complex not within the PKT, namely Gardner (16.1 degrees N, 34.1 degrees E, similar to 70 km in diameter) on the northern edge of Mare Tranquillitatis, whose origin is enigmatic. Here we use multi-source remote-sensing data to assess its morphology, composition and stratigraphy to better understand its formation and evolution. Results show that domes, sinuous rilles, and an irregular depression exist in this region. Gardner has experienced four stages of volcanic activities with absolute model ages from 3.90 to 2.96 Ga, contemporaneous with the main volcanic activity periods of the lunar nearside. An area with relatively low albedo, high FeO and TiO2 contents, low rock abundances, and young surface age is identified in the southeast part of the irregular depression at the summit of the plateau, which could have been the result of a long-lived eruptive center. Quasi-circular positive Bouguer-gravity anomaly suggests either sill/laccolith intrusions or large conduit solidifications underneath this area, which could be related to its surrounding radially distributed lava domes, wrinkle ridges and faults. We conclude that Gardner is the largest central-vent volcano identified so far on the Moon, and it provides an essentially new perspective and supplement for the knowledge of the lunar nearside volcanism.

TI  - Comparison of survival of patients with endometrial cancer undergoing sentinel node biopsy alone or systematic lymphadenectomy
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Recently, sentinel lymph node mapping was introduced in the surgical staging of endometrial cancer as alternative to systematic lymphadenectomy. However, the survival impact of sentinel node mapping is not well characterized yet. Methods We performed retrospective study of 104 patients with endometrial cancer treated with sentinel lymph node alone (n = 52) or with pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy (n = 52). For sentinel node mapping, indocyanine green was used. The outcome measure was disease-free survival. Results Median follow-up was 42 months. Fifty-two patients staged by sentinel lymph node mapping were matched in 1:1 ratio with 52 patients staged by lymphadenectomy using patient age, histological type, tumor stage, tumor grade and lymph and vascular space invasion as matching criteria. The median number of removed lymph node was 3 (range 1-6) and 36 (13-63) in the sentinel and lymphadenectomy group, respectively. The rate of lymph node metastases was not significantly higher in the sentinel group (19.2%) in comparison with the lymphadenectomy group (14.3%). The overall detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes was 100% with a bilateral mapping of 98.1%. Most of the 152 lymph nodes identified and removed were localized in upper paracervical pathway (n = 143, 94.1%). During the follow-up period, overall 21 (20.2%) events were observed, 8 (15.4%) in the sentinel group and 13 (25.0%) in the lymphadenectomy group. The estimated disease-free survival was 84.6% and 75.0% for patients in the sentinel and lymphadenectomy groups, respectively. The survival curves demonstrated similar disease-free survival in two groups (p = 0.774). Conclusion Sentinel lymph node mapping did not compromise the outcome of patients with endometrial cancer.

TI  - Characterizing interseismic deformation of the Xianshuihe fault, eastern Tibetan Plateau, using Sentinel-1 SAR images
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Xianshuihe fault is a very large left-lateral strike-slip fault, located on the eastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau. In the late Cenozoic, this fault played a vital role in accommodating crustal deformation of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. High-spatial-resolution deformation measurements are key to understanding the deformation mechanism (block-like mode or continued mode) and seismic potential of this fault. However, due to the high elevation, harsh field conditions, and dense vegetation coverage, such data has not been available until now. In this study, we processed two descending tracks of Sentinel-1 images taken between 2015 and 2018 to obtain high-spatial-resolution deformation velocity fields of the Xianshuihe fault. Fault slip rate distribution was then inverted using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)-derived deformation as a constraint. Moreover, the seismic potential was evaluated by combining the interseismic fault movement, rupture of major historical earthquakes, and modern seismicity distribution. The results are as follows. (1) The present-day slip rate of the Xianshuihe fault is constrained as 9-12 mm/yr, and along-strike variations of the slip rate are small, in contrast to geological results but similar to GPS results. (2) The crustal material properties constrained by InSAR/GPS differ on either side of the Xianshuihe fault, in agreement with seismological data. (3) Shallow creep is occurring along the northwest Xianshuihe fault. (4) Local near-field post-seismic deformation is likely related to the 2014 Kangding M6.3 earthquake sequence. (5) The Qiajiao, Daofu, and Bamei segments are capable of strong earthquakes. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatial scale effects on retrieval accuracy of surface solar radiation using satellite data
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of nonhomogeneous clouds and their induced radiation interactions result in significant horizontal photon transport and spatially adjacent effects on surface solar radiation (SSR), making spatial estimation scale-dependent. Overlooking scale effects during SSR retrieval from satellite data is responsible for variations in retrieval accuracy and deviations in associated applications. In this paper, the spatial scale effects on SSR retrieval accuracy are investigated using multivariate linear regression and artificial neural network and convolutional neural network models. Scale effects are quantified through changes in retrieval accuracy under varying satellite data input size and compared among different models to reveal the merits and defects of classic linear, ordinary nonlinear, and spatially nonlinear models. The results show that scale effects have considerable impacts on retrieval accuracy in each of the three models for both site-specific and general conditions. The maximum improvement in terms of the root mean square error can reach up to 9% after involving scale information. The performance of site-specific models is continually enhanced with the expansion of spatial scale, while that of general models will drop to some extent beyond a particular threshold. Approximate distances of 20 km and 40 km from the central location are identified as the optimal scale for artificial neural and convolutional neural networks, respectively. This study also concludes that the robustness of general models is relevant to various atmospheric factors, providing perspectives for further improvements including the fusion of time series images, integration with physical modules, and the combination of multi-resolution data.

TI  - Global climatic controls on interannual variability of ecosystem productivity: Similarities and differences inferred from solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and enhanced vegetation index
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing how climate factors regulate the interannual variability (IAV) of ecosystem productivity globally is crucial for understanding the ecosystem-climate interactions and carbon-climate feedbacks under a changing climate. However, our understanding of global climatic controls on the IAV of ecosystem productivity has been limited by the lack of direct measurements of ecosystem productivity at the global scale. We used a long-term, fine-resolution solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) product (GOSIF) derived from SIF soundings measured by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) to investigate how climatic factors drive the IAV of global ecosystem productivity. We also examined how the results derived from SIF differed from those based on a satellite-derived measure of vegetation greenness and productivity - the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Both productivity measures showed the dominant role of soil moisture in driving the IAV of global ecosystem productivity, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. SIF was more sensitive to climate variability than was EVI. SIF was positively correlated with solar radiation in the humid regions, while no significant correlations were found between EVI and solar radiation. The stronger correlation of SIF with climate factors was also observed at the ecosystem level based on a number of eddy covariance flux sites, indicating that SIF had a higher ability in capturing the variations of gross primary productivity (GPP) than did EVI. The comparison between SIF and EVI also highlighted the biome-specific (depending on the tree cover) responses of ecosystem productivity to solar radiation under water stress. Our findings explicitly reveal the global climatic controls on the IAV of ecosystem productivity, and provide insight into the mechanistic differences between SIF and vegetation indices in characterizing ecosystem productivity.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol optical properties from Version 3 (V3) of AERONET are used to classify the aerosol types in Europe, Middle East/North Africa (MENA) and Arabian Peninsula, during 2008-2017. Quality-assured data of Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), Fine Mode Fraction (FMF) and Angstrom Exponent (AE) from 39 stations are used to classify the aerosol types, based on threshold limits of these optical properties. The aerosol type depends on the location and the sources of each region of study; for example, in Atlantic, Arabian Peninsula and MENA, the dominant aerosol type is coarse absorbing due to dust from Sahara and Arabian deserts. However, in Arabian Peninsula, fine particles are also observed in autumn and winter. In addition, the lower percentages of coarse absorbing particles across MENA are observed in the East because of increased fine particle emissions from human activities. In the stations of the Group A of South Europe, a bimodal size distribution is revealed and the dominant aerosol types are the fine-slightly absorbing and non-absorbing, followed by coarse absorbing due to Sahara dust outbreaks. In the stations of the Group B of South Europe, fine slightly absorbing and non-absorbing particles are primarily observed since the stations are located in urban/industrial regions. In Central and East Europe, the prevailing aerosol type is fine-non absorbing which is followed by the fine slightly absorbing aerosols from urban/industrial sites. The results of the aerosol type characterization are presumed to give a better assessment of regional climate and local air pollution. The proposed method could be used to compare aerosol classification results from satellite and chemical transport models, as well as for the validation of satellite data and the improved performance of models and remote sensing algorithms in the future.

TI  - Individualized Prophylactic Neck Irradiation in Patients with cNO Head and Neck Cancer Based on Sentinel Lymph Node(s) Identification: Definitive Results of a Prospective Phase 1-2 Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This prospective, nonrandomized, interventional phase 1-2 study investigated the individualization of elective node irradiation in clinically N0 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma by sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping with single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and its impact on tumor control and radiation-related toxicity.Methods and Materials: Forty-four patients with clinically NO head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with definitive (chemo-)radiation therapy were imaged with SPECT/CT after Tc-99m nanocolloid injection around the tumor. The neck levels containing up to the 4 hottest SLNs were selected for prophylactic irradiation. A comparative virtual planning was performed with the selection of neck levels based on the current international guidelines. Regional control was monitored as a function of the selected volume. Dosimetric data for the organs at risk were compared between the plans. Normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) rates were derived for xerostomia, dysphagia, and hypothyroidism to predict the clinical benefit and correlated to quality-of-life (QoL) assessments at 6 months.Results: Sixteen percent of patients presented unpredicted lymphatic drainage, and 48% drained unilaterally. The nodal clinical target volume based on lymphoscintigraphy was smaller than the nodal clinical target volume based on international guidelines by a factor of 2 (P < .0001). After a median follow-up of 46 months, only 1 patient experienced a regional relapse in a nonirradiated area. Significant median dose reductions to organs at risk were observed, particularly to contralateral salivary glands in patients with unilateral drainage (14.6-28.1 Gy) and to the thyroid gland in all patients (22.4-48.9 Gy). Median NTCP reductions were observed for xerostomia (0.3% to 13.7%), dysphagia (1.7% to 10.8%), and hypothyroidism (14.0% to 36.1%). QoL at 6 months was improved, particularly in patients irradiated unilaterally.Conclusions: Neck SLN mapping with SPECT/CT individualizes and reduces the elective nodal target volumes without compromising the regional control. The NTCP rates were reduced and favorable QoL were observed in all patients, particularly in the case of unilateral irradiation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Raindrop size distribution and microphysical characteristics of a great rainstorm in 2016 in Beijing, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes the characteristics of rain drop size distributions (DSDs) and vertical profiles of hydrometeors for a severe rainstorm event that occurred in Beijing, northern China, from 19 to 21 July 2016 using in situ measurements from two disdrometers (OTT-Parsivel(2) and 2D-Video-Distrometer) and remote sensing data collected by a second-generation Micro Rain Radar (MRR2). This rainstorm was characterized by stratiform precipitation with embedded strong convection on 19 July and widespread, intense mixed convective-stratified rainfall resulting in persistent rainfall between 20 and 21 July. The temporal and spatial variations in rainfall rate R, liquid water content W, reflectivity Z, DSDs and the gamma DSD parameters in different precipitation episodes of this event are derived and compared between two meteorological stations in Beijing.Rainfall throughout the entire event was characterized by large concentrations of small- to medium-sized raindrops (diameters between 2 and 4 mm) and few larger particles (D > 4 mm), resulting in small values of reflectivity Z (< 40 dBZ) and liquid water content W ( < 1.0 g m(-3)). In addition, the log(10)N(w)-D-m scatter pairs recorded during the convective phase of this rainstorm indicate maritime-like convection. The time evolution of DSDs shows that most single peak DSDs occurred during stratiform rainfall, and bimodal DSDs were observed when the convective rainfall cells passed by and collisional breakups occurred. The gamma DSD model with a single peak in the stratiform phase of the storm and the bimodal DSD in the convective episode of the storm are quantitatively evaluated. In addition, in each precipitation episode, the differences in exponent b and coefficient A of the Z-R relationship between the two stations are smaller for stratiform rainfall than for convective rainfall due to the more evident variability of drop size and number concentration in convective rain. The physical nature of this relationship and the possible mechanisms leading to diverse characteristics in different phases of this heavy rainstorm are discussed.

TI  - Assessment of calanchi and rill-interrill erosion susceptibility in northern Liguria, Italy: A case study using a probabilistic modelling framework
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils are a vital part of the natural environment and one of the most important natural resources. The European Mediterranean Regions are particularly sensitive to soil degradation. Especially in Italy many landscapes are prone to water related soil erosion processes such as rill-interrill erosion (sheet erosion), gullies and complex processes forming "calanchi" corresponding to the English term "Badlands". Calanchi develop preferentially on Plio-Pleistocene deposits, which are highly susceptible to aquatic erosion processes. This study focusses on the assessment of rill-interrill erosion as well as calanchi erosion forms and features in previously none or very little-studied areas of the Langhe-Roero and Monferrato, located in the Liguria and Piedmont Region, Northern Apennines, Italy. In this study we assess the driving factors and the spatial distribution of rill-interrill and calanchi erosion processes using a geostatistical/geostochastic modelling framework. Therefore, a Maximum Entropy Model, a Generalized Linear Model and a Boosted Regression Tree approach were applied. As independent environmental variables we selected DEM based morphometric information as well as pedologic, and geologic input data. Moreover, we explore remote sensing techniques to derive information on the vegetation density and vitality. The stochastic models applied show, that the two very different soil erosion phenomena can be differentiated well with the chosen stochastic techniques. The main drivers controlling the spatial distribution of aquatic soil erosion in the study area are soil type, slope, elevation and topographic wetness index. The results of the MaxEnt and BRT model were confirmed by the GLM application in terms of the significance of predictor variables. Generally, the models show an acceptable to excellent performance with BRT and GLM outperforming MaxEnt. The single independent variable response curves gave valuable insights into the process triggering the erosion forms. We were able to clearly differentiate between the processes looking at the response curves that show reasonable characteristics with all applied models.

TI  - Role of ducks in the transmission cycle of tick-borne encephalitis virus?
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the family Flaviviridae, is the most important tick-transmitted arbovirus in Europe. It can cause severe illnesses in humans and in various animal species. The main mechanism for the spread of TBEV into new areas is considered to be the translocation of infected ticks. To find out whether ducks can function as a natural virus reservoir in addition to serving as passive transport vectors, we carried out an experimental TBEV challenge study to reveal their susceptibility and resulting pathogenesis. Nineteen ducks were inoculated subcutaneously with TBEV strain 'Neudoerfl' and monitored for 21 days. Blood, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected throughout the experiment and organ samples upon necropsy at the end of the study. All samples were tested for TBEV-RNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction. TBEV-specific antibodies were determined by virus neutralization test and ELISA. Organ samples were examined histopathologically and by immunohistochemistry. The inoculated ducks did not show any clinical symptoms. TBEV-specific RNA was detected in all brain samples as well as in a few blood and swab samples. Moreover, all challenged birds produced TBEV antibodies and showed a mild to severe acute to subacute necrotizing encephalitis. TBEV-specific antigen was detected in the brain of 14 ducks by immunohistochemistry. The short and low viremic phases, as well as the low virus load in tissues, suggest that ducks should not be considered as reservoir hosts. However, due to the high antibody levels, ducks can serve as sentinel species for the detection of natural TBEV foci.

TI  - Primary productivity and climate control mushroom yields in Mediterranean pine forests
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mushrooms play a provisioning ecosystem service as wild food. The abundance of this resource shows high annual and interannual variability, particularly in Mediterranean ecosystems. Climate conditions have been considered the main factor promoting mushroom production variability, but several evidences suggest that forest composition, age and growth play also a role.Long-term mushroom production datasets are critical to understand the factors behind mushroom productivity. We used 22 and 24 year-long time series of mushroom production in Pinus pinaster and Pinus sylvestris forests in Central Spain to evaluate the effect of climate and forest productivity on mushroom yield. We combined climatic data (precipitation and temperature) and remote sensing data (soil moisture and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI, a surrogate of primary productivity) to model mushroom yields for each forest and for the main edible species of economic interest ( Boletus edulis and Lactarius deliciosus).We hypothesized that mushroom yield would be related to (i) forest primary productivity inferred from NDVI affects mushroom yields, that (ii) soil moisture inferred from remote sensors will equal the predictive power precipitation data, and that (iii) combining climatic and remote sensing will improve mushroom yield models.We found that (i) previous year NDVI correlated (r = 0.41-0.6) with mushroom yields; (ii) soil moisture from remote sensors rivaled the predictive power of precipitation (r = 0.63-0.72); and (iii) primary production and climate variances were independent, thus the combination of climatic and remote sensing data improved models with mean R-adj(2) as high as 0.629.On the light of these results, we propose as a working hypothesis that mushroom production might be modelled as a two step process. Previous year primary productivity would favour resource accumulation at tree level, potentially increasing resources for mycelia growth, climatic conditions during the fruiting season control the ability of mycelia to transform available resources into fruiting bodies.

TI  - Intranodal Administration of Neoantigen Peptide-loaded Dendritic Cell Vaccine Elicits Epitope-specific T Cell Responses and Clinical Effects in a Patient with Chemorefractory Ovarian Cancer with Malignant Ascites
T2  - IMMUNOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chemorefractory ovarian cancer has limited therapeutic options. Hence, new types of treatment including neoantigen-specific immunotherapy need to be investigated. Neoantigens represent promising targets for personalized cancer immunotherapy. We here describe the clinical and immunological effects of a neoantigen peptide-loaded DC-based immunotherapy in a patient with recurrent and chemoresistant ovarian cancer. A 71-year-old female patient with chemorefractory ovarian cancer and malignant ascites received intranodal vaccination of DCs loaded with four neoantigen peptides that were predicted by our immunogenomic pipeline. Following four rounds of vaccinations with this therapy, CA-125 levels were remarkably declined and tumor cells in the ascites were also decreased. Concordantly, the tumor-related symptoms such as respiratory discomfort improved without any adverse reactions. The reactivity against one HLA-A2402-restricted neoantigen peptide derived from a mutated PPM1 F protein was detected in lymphocytes from peripheral blood by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay. Furthermore, the neoantigen (PPM1 F mutant)-specific TCRs were detected in the tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes post-vaccination. Our results showed that vaccination with intranodal injection of neoantigen peptide-loaded DCs may have clinical and immunological impacts on cancer treatment.

TI  - Structure and composition of field margin vegetation in the rural-urban interface of Bengaluru, India: a case study on an unexplored dimension of agroecosystems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Field margin vegetation (FMV) refers to the plant community in the interface between agriculture and natural environments. Substantial work has been carried out on the management of field margins in European countries with the aim of conserving field-level biodiversity and enhancing agronomic benefits. India, instead, is lagging behind in the assessment of FMV and formulating subsequent management strategies for biodiversity conservation at the field boundaries. This study is a first step to better understand the structural and functional dimensions of field margin vegetation along an agricultural transformation gradient near the megacity of Bengaluru, India. Empirical field studies along with the detection of vegetation change using remote sensing and geo-informatics technique were used to record information on field margin vegetation. The phytosociological study, revealed a total of 81 species, comprising 29 species of trees, 21 shrubs and 31 herbs at the field margins of six selected villages of northern Bengaluru. Randomly selected 355 field boundaries were delineated from high-resolution Worldview 3 images for the year 2018 and from Google Earth images for the year 2004-2005. The FMV area was around to 85.40 ha in 2004-2005 but declined to 76.69 ha in 2017-2018. The survey also indicated that local farmers have in-depth ecological knowledge on the importance of FMV in ensuring a sustainable flow of resources within the agricultural landscape. The results demonstrate that rural and transition zones of the study area have higher dominance of planted tree species on the margins, whereas urban zone exhibits comparatively uniform dominance for all species. Our study also highlights the need for conservation of FMV to ensure agroecosystem health as a prerequisite for sustainable socioecological development.

TI  - SPECT-CT visualization and biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with stage IAB-IIA cervical cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and to determine clinical significance of preoperative single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT-CT). Methods We retrospectively evaluate data and images of 55 women with stage IAB-IIA cervical cancer that underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy and subsequent lymph node dissection.Tc-99m-phytate (300 MBq) was injected submucosally in 4 points and SPECT-CT started 2 h after the injection. All lymph nodes (LN) that accumulated radiocolloids were regarded as sentinel. Next day after the mapping radical hysterectomy with complete pelvic and parametrial LN dissection and SLN biopsy were performed according to the institute protocol. Results SPECT-CT identified SLNs in 51 of 55 patients. All SLNs were successfully detected during the surgery. The SLN mapping efficacy was 92.7%. LN metastases were diagnosed in 6/51 (11.8%) cases, including 2 patients with positive SLNs. Sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV) and false-negative rate for SLN biopsy were as follows: 33.4%, 91.8% and 66.6%. In patients with unilateral SPECT-CT localization of SLNs, LN metastases were identified in 4 (20%) of 20 patients but SLN biopsy was false negative in all cases. In 31 women, SPECT-CT detected SLNs on both sides of the pelvis. In this group, regional LN metastases were diagnosed in 2 patients, and in both cases metastases were detected only in SLNs. Conclusions In women with SPECT-CT visualization of SLNs on both sides of the pelvis, SLN biopsy had high sensitivity and NPV. In patients with unilateral SLN localization, SLN biopsy cannot be used for the prediction of regional LN status.

TI  - Assessing nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) levels as a contributing factor to coronavirus (COVID-19) fatality
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an ambient trace-gas result of both natural and anthropogenic processes. Long-termexposure to NO2 may cause a wide spectrum of severe health problems such as hypertension, diabetes, heart and cardiovascular diseases and even death. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between long-term exposure to NO2 and coronavirus fatality. The Sentinel-5P is used for mapping the tropospheric NO2 distribution and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for evaluating the atmospheric capability to disperse the pollution. The spatial analysis has been conducted on a regional scale and combined with the number of death cases taken from 66 administrative regions in Italy, Spain, France and Germany. Results show that out of the 4443 fatality cases, 3487 (78%) were in five regions located in north Italy and central Spain. Additionally, the same five regions show the highest NO2 concentrations combined with downwards airflow which prevent an efficient dispersion of air pollution. These results indicate that the long-term exposure to this pollutantmay be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the COVID-19 virus in these regions and maybe across the whole world.

TI  - A comparison of three models used to determine water fluxes over the Albany Thicket, Eastern Cape, South Africa
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Albany Thicket (AT) biome contains outstanding global biodiversity as well as the potential to achieve carbon credits associated with water-efficient Crasslucean acid metabolism (CAM). Understanding the water fluxes in the AT is crucial to determining carbon (C) sequestration rates and water-use efficiency. Despite large variation in water fluxes across the AT, only a few studies have been conducted in this region with their results validated against short periods of observed data. This study aims to evaluate three models of water fluxes over AT against data from an eddy covariance (EC) system active from October 2015 to May 2018. ET was modelled using the BioGeoChemistry Management (BGC-MAN) model, a biophysical model (Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML)) and a remotely-sensed product (MOD16), and their results compared with that from the EC system. More than three decades of rainfall data from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data (CHIRPS) was used to assess some rainfall characteristics of the region. The mean annual rainfall is 404 mm and mean monthly rainfall ranges from 16.0-50.7 mm, with minima likely to occur in winter period (between May and July) and monthly maxima in the summer period (between October and March). Among the three hydrological years in this study, total ET for 2016-2017 exceeded rainfall received by about 7% which shows that AT is likely to be supported by groundwater at some point but this requires further investigations. Generally, the three models applied in this study performed reasonably well when compared with the measured ET. The cumulative ET from BGC-MAN was slightly higher than that from EC by 16% and 8% in 2015-2016 and 2017-2018 hydrological years respectively while PML was slightly lower by 3% and 17% in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018; additionally, MODIS was slightly lower by 14% and 7% in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018, respectively. However, the correlation between the ET from EC and simulated ET from the three models was significant at p < 0.01.

TI  - An automated method for removal of striping artifacts in fluorescent whole-slide microscopy
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Whole slide scanners often acquire images of tissue sections that are larger than their field of view through tile or line-scanning. The subsequently stitched or aligned images can often suffer from imaging artifacts such as horizontal or vertical stripes. These stripes degrade the image quality in fluorescent biological imaging samples and can also limit the accuracy of any subsequent analyses such as cell segmentation.New method: We propose a novel data-driven method of removing stripe artifacts in stitched biological images based on the location of the stripes, background modeling, and illumination correction. This method provides an automated way of removing the stripes of an individual image while preserving image details and quality for subsequent analyses.Results: The results were assessed using both qualitative and quantitative metrics and the algorithm has proven very effective in removing the stripe artifacts from hundreds of brain images.Comparison with existing methods: Several metrics were used to quantify the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to other published techniques. Images with simulated artifacts were created so that full-reference metrics could be applied to demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm for a wider variety of illumination profiles.Conclusions: We describe a data analysis pipeline that allows for automatic removal of stripes caused by line-scanning. Our proposed method can be applied without the need for separate blank field of view images or use of image batches to model the background, so it is suitable for real-time parallel batch processing of large datasets.

AB  - In recent years, the Mediterranean area has witnessed an increase of both the frequency and severity of large fires, which appears to be intimately associated with climate and land use changes. To measure the impact of wildfires on living organisms, diverse indicators have been proposed. These indicators of fire severity traditionally rely on quantifying the damage caused to the vegetal component of ecosystems. However, the use of bacterial communities as severity indicators has received less attention. Here, we studied the differences between bacterial communities of three different Mediterranean ecosystems, two shrubby and one arboreal, two months after a large wildfire. Two levels of severity were compared to a control unburnt soil. The results showed that greater fire severity triggers a reduction in the diversity of soil bacterial communities. In high-severity fires, this reduction reached 40.6 and 58.6% of the control values for richness and Shannon's diversity, respectively. We also found that the greatest differences between communities could be attributed first to the severity of the fire, and second to the ecosystem from which they originated. Importantly, species of just five families of bacteria: Oxalobacteraceae, Micrococcaceae, Paenibacillaceae, Bacillaceae and Planococcaceae, became dominant in all three ecosystems. The average frequency increase for particular species was 100 times. However, due to random uncontrolled factors, the species that became dominant in each community were not always the same.

TI  - Water properties in the La Plata River Estuary from VIIRS observations
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) between 2012 and 2018 are used to characterize and quantify water optical properties in the La Plata River Estuary (or Rio de la Plata Estuary). Satellite-measured normalized waterleaving radiance spectra nL(w)(lambda) are found to be similar with the peak at the 671 nm red band in the inner and mid estuaries, while nL(w)(lambda)) spectra peak at the 551 nm green band in the outer estuary. Remarkable seasonal and inter-annual variability are also observed in the La Plata River Estuary. The austral autumn (March-May) is found to be the most turbid season. An enhanced radiance ratio nL(w)(745)/nL(w)(671) is also found to occur during the austral autumn season in the inner and mid estuaries. The La Plata River Estuary had the most turbid water in 2012 in terms of the satellite-measured water diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm K-d (490) in the inner and mid estuaries. The low K-d (490) in the inner and mid estuaries during 2015-2016 coincided with the strong 2015-2016 El Nino event. The first and second empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes account for about 34.9% and 27.0% of the total K-d (490) variance in the La Plata River Estuary, respectively. In addition, the K-d (490) variation in the inner and mid estuaries is out of phase with that in the outer estuary. The winds, rainfall, and river discharge are attributed to the first and second EOF modes of the K-d(490) in the La Plata River Estuary.

TI  - Response of topographic control on nearest-neighbor diffusion-based pan-sharpening using multispectral MODIS and AWiFS satellite dataset
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing plays a significant role in monitoring of the undulating the Himalayas. With continuous monitoring, the preservation of natural resources and mitigation of natural hazards is possible. Currently, satellite sensors are not capable enough to deliver the earth surface image at a very high temporal, spectral, and spatial resolution, simultaneously. Therefore, it is essential to perform the pan-sharpening of spatially high-resolution (HR) panchromatic (PAN) spectral band with low-resolution (LR) multispectral (MS) imagery which must be acquired on the same temporal date from multiple sensors. On the other hand, due to the rugged topography of the Himalayas, topographic effects are generally induced in the form of shadow and affect the spatial information or spectral information. Therefore, the focus of the present work is to implement and analyze the performance of topographic correction on nearest-neighbor diffusion (NND)-based pan-sharpening algorithm. In order to evaluate the effectiveness, K-mean classification (KMC) has been implemented over topographically corrected and topographically uncorrected NND pan-sharpened images. From the experimental outcomes, it is inferred that topographically corrected NND pan-sharpened classified image has achieved better accuracy (81.33%) as compared with topographically uncorrected NND pan-sharpened classified imagery (78%). It is expected that the integration of topographic correction and NND algorithm facilitates the better extraction of spectral and spatial information and leads to improvement in results for further analysis such as change detection procedure and classification. The applications of the present study are in monitoring of climate change and mapping land cover changes over rugged terrain regions.

TI  - Aerosol Direct Radiative Effect Sensitivity Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Both to reconcile the large range in satellite-based estimates of the aerosol direct radiative effect (DRE) and to optimize the design of future observing systems, this study builds a framework for assessing aerosol DRE uncertainty. Shortwave aerosol DRE radiative kernels (Jacobians) were derived using the MERRA-2 reanalysis data. These radiative kernels give the differential response of the aerosol DRE to perturbations in the aerosol extinction coefficient, aerosol single-scattering albedo, aerosol asymmetry factor, surface albedo, cloud fraction, and cloud optical depth. This comprehensive set of kernels provides a convenient way to consistently and accurately assess the aerosol DRE uncertainties that result from observational or model-based uncertainties. The aerosol DRE kernels were used to test the effect of simplifying the full vertical profile of aerosol scattering properties into column-integrated quantities. This analysis showed that, although the clear-sky aerosol DRE can be had fairly accurately, more significant errors occur for the all-sky DRE. The sensitivity in determining the broadband spectral dependencies of the aerosol scattering properties directly from a limited set of wavelengths was quantified. These spectral dependencies can be reasonably constrained using column-integrated aerosol scattering properties in the midvisible and near-infrared wavelengths. Separating the aerosol DRE and its kernels by scene type shows that accurate aerosol properties in the clear sky are the most crucial component of the global aerosol DRE. In cloudy skies, determining aerosol properties in the presence of optically thin cloud is more radiatively important than doing so when optically thick cloud is present.

TI  - Impact of climate, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide, and other environmental factors on water-use efficiency at multiple land cover types
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rising atmospheric CO2, changing climate, and other environmental factors such as nitrogen deposition and aerosol concentration influence carbon and water fluxes significantly. Water-use efficiency (WUE) was used to analyze these factors over 3 decades (1981-2010) using the Community Land Model 5.0 (CLM5.0). The study analyzes the effects of climate and other environmental factors on multiple land cover types (forest, grassland, and cropland) with divided study periods (1981-2000 and 2001-2010). Ecosystem WUE (EWUE) and transpiration WUE (TWUE) increased at the forest site due to the CO2 fertilization effect but decreased at the grassland and cropland sites due to lower gross primary production and higher/lower (cropland/grassland) evapotranspiration as consequences of rising temperature and water availability. Inherent WUE confirmed that EWUE and TWUE trends were controlled by the rising temperature and CO2-induced warming through an increase in vapor pressure deficit. In this way, forest and cropland sites showed warming patterns, while the grassland site showed a drier climate. The later period (2001-2010) showed steeper trends in WUE compared with the earlier period at all sites, implying a change in climate. The results showed implications for rising temperature due to increased CO2 concentration at multiple land cover types.

TI  - Integrating a PhenoCam-derived vegetation index into a light use efficiency model to estimate daily gross primary production in a semi-arid grassland
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of temporally-continuous gross primary production (GPP) is important for a mechanistic understanding of the global carbon budget, as well as the carbon exchange between land and atmosphere. Ground-based PhenoCams can provide near-surface observations of plant phenology with high temporal resolution and possess great potential for use in modeling the seasonal dynamics of GPP. However, due to the site-level empirical approaches for estimating the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), a broad application of PhenoCams in GPP modeling has been restricted. In this study, the stage of vegetation phenology (P-scalar) is proposed, which is calculated from the excess green index (ExGI) derived from PhenoCam data. We integrate Pscalar with the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in order to generate a daily time-series of the fAPAR (fAPAR(CAM)), and then to estimate daily GPP (GPP(CAM)) with a light use efficiency model in a semi-arid grassland area from 2012 to 2014. Over the three continuous years, the daily fAPAR(CAM) exhibited similar temporal behavior to the eddy covariance-measured GPP (GPP(EC)), and the overall determination coefficients (R-2) were all > 0.81. GPP(CAM) agreed well with GPPEC, and these agreements were highly statistically significant (p < 0.01); R-2 varied from 0.80 to 0.87, the relative error (RE) varied from -2.9% to 2.81%, and the root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 0.83 to 0.98 gC/m(2)/d. GPP(CAM) was then resampled to 8-day temporal resolution (GPP(CAM8d)), and further evaluated by comparisons with MODIS GPP products (GPP(MOD17)) and vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM)-derived GPP (GPP(VPM)). Validation revealed that the variance explained by GPP(CAM8d) was still the greatest among these three GPP products. The RMSE and RE of GPPCAM8d were also lower than those of the other two GPP products. The explanatory power of predictors in GPP modeling was also explored; the fAPAR was found to be the most influential predictor, followed by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The contributions of the environmental stress indices of temperature and water (T-scalar and W-scalar, respectively) were less than that of PAR. These results highlight the potential for PhenoCam images in high temporal resolution GPP modeling. Our GPP modeling method will help reduce uncertainties by using PhenoCam images for monitoring the seasonal development of vegetation production.

TI  - Combined MODIS land surface temperature and greenness data for modeling vegetation phenology, physiology, and gross primary production in terrestrial ecosystems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology such as the start (SOS) and end (EOS) of the growing season, physiology (represented by seasonal maximum capacity of carbon uptake, GPPmax), and gross primary production (GPP) are sensitive indicators formonitoring ecosystemresponse to environmental change. However, uncertainty and disagreement between models limit the use phenologymetrics and GPP derived fromremote sensing data. Statistical models for estimating phenology and physiologywere constructed based on key predictor variables derived from enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and land surface temperature (LST) data. Then, a statistical model that integrated remote sensing-based phenology and physiology (RS-SMIPP) datawas constructed to estimate seasonal and annual GPP. Thesemodelswere calibrated and validatedwith GPP observations from512 site-years of FLUXNET data covering four plant functional types (PFTs) in the northern hemisphere: deciduous broadleaf forest, evergreen needle-leaf forest, mixed forest, and grassland. Our results showed that phenology and physiologywere accurately estimated with relative root mean squared error (RMSEr) <20%, and the errors varied among the PFTs. Spring EVI was an important factor in explaining variation of GPPmax. The RS-SMIPP model outperformed the MOD17 algorithm in accurately estimating seasonal and annual GPP and reduced RMSEr from 25.34%-43.44% to 9.53%-26.19% for annual GPP of the different PFTs. These findings demonstrate that remote sensing-based phenological and physiological indicators could be used to explain the variations of seasonal and annual GPP, and provide an efficient way for improving GPP estimations at a global scale.

T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant wave height (SWH) is an important wave parameter that is related to near-shore activities and research on the phenomenon near the air-sea interface. Here, we proposed a new method for retrieving SWH from C-band Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric wide mode data based on convolutional neural network (CNN), which can directly establish the empirical relationship between normalized radar cross section and SWH. We collected 1597 Sentinel-1 SAR images matched with in situ buoys and conducted homogeneity tests for each of the matched sub-images, producing similar to 3330 matchups with 2028 of them being VV-polarization. After training, the VV-polarization data extracted by 0.5 threshold for homogeneity test perform better, and the comparison between these results and in situ buoy measurements in validation data indicates a SWH root mean square error of 0.32 m, a 23.58% scatter index and a 0.90 correlation coefficient. And the SWH from CNN-based method is also validated with radar altimeter data and Wavewatch3 data. These results demonstrate that the proposed CNN method is suitable for retrieving SWH from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery with some constraints on the matched dataset.

TI  - Development of a global 30m impervious surface map using multisource and multitemporal remote sensing datasets with the Google Earth Engine platform
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The amount of impervious surface is an important indicator in the monitoring of the intensity of human activity and environmental change. The use of remote sensing techniques is the only means of accurately carrying out global mapping of impervious surfaces covering large areas. Optical imagery can capture surface reflectance characteristics, while synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images can be used to provide information on the structure and dielectric properties of surface materials. In addition, nighttime light (NTL) imagery can detect the intensity of human activity and thus provide important a priori probabilities of the occurrence of impervious surfaces. In this study, we aimed to generate an accurate global impervious surface map at a resolution of 30m for 2015 by combining Landsat 8 Operational Land Image (OLI) optical images, Sentinel-1 SAR images and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) NTL images based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. First, the global impervious and nonimpervious training samples were automatically derived by combining the GlobeLand30 land-cover product with VIIRS NTL and MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) imagery. Then, the local adaptive random forest classifiers, allowing for a regional adjustment of the classification parameters to take into account the regional characteristics, were trained and used to generate regional impervious surface maps for each 5 degrees x 5 degrees geographical grid using local training samples and multisource and multitemporal imagery. Finally, a global impervious surface map, produced by mosaicking numerous 5 degrees x 5 degrees regional maps, was validated by interpretation samples and then compared with five existing impervious products (GlobeLand30, FROM-GLC, NUACI, HBASE and GHSL). The results indicated that the global impervious surface map produced using the proposed multisource, multitemporal random forest classification (MSMT_RF) method was the most accurate of the maps, having an overall accuracy of 95.1% and kappa coefficient (one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability; Olofsson et al., 2014) of 0.898 as against 85.6% and 0.695 for NUACI, 89.6% and 0.780 for FROM-GLC, 90.3% and 0.794 for GHSL, 88.4% and 0.753 for GlobeLand30, and 88.0% and 0.745 for HBASE using all 15 regional validation data. Therefore, it is concluded that a global 30m impervious surface map can accurately and efficiently be generated by the proposed MSMT_RF method based on the GEE platform. The global impervious surface map generated in this paper is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3505079 (Zhang and Liu, 2019).

TI  - Teaching NeuroImages: High-resolution MRI before and during a sentinel headache demonstrates aneurysm wall hemorrhage
T2  - NEUROLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - A 3T brain MRI, performed in a 48-year-old woman presenting with progressive headaches, demonstrated a 20-mm unruptured saccular basilar artery aneurysm. High-resolution vessel-wall MRI showed a chronic mural thrombus and a circumferential aneurysm wall enhancement (figure), an imaging marker of aneurysm instability.(1)Two days later, she had a transient thunderclap headache, considered the worst headache she had ever reported. Repeated 3T MRI demonstrated acute mural hemorrhage without subarachnoid hemorrhage. Sentinel headaches, reported in every fourth patient preceding aneurysm rupture,(2)have been interpreted as reflecting a warning for subarachnoid leak or, alternatively, structural wall changes, such as stretching or acute mural hemorrhage.

T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pre-licensure trials of ROTAVAC (R) were not adequately powered to assess risk of intussusception, a rare adverse event associated with other rotavirus vaccines in some settings. We examined the risk of intussusception after ROTAVAC (R) vaccination among Indian infants during pilot rollout of the vaccine in the public health system in three states - Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.Methods: Passive surveillance for intussusception was set up in 35 sentinel health facilities covering 26.3 million population in the three states under monitoring of an Interministerial-Interagency Steering Committee. Clinical and immunization data were collected by independent teams. An expert committee blinded to vaccination status, classified intussusception cases using Brighton criteria. The self-controlled case-series method was used to estimate risk of intussusception (Brighton Level 1) after ROTAVAC (R) vaccination.Results: 151 intussusception cases were included in the analysis. The relative incidence (incidence during the risk period compared to the control period) 1-21 days after doses 1 and 2 combined was 1.56 (95% CI, 0.0-5.28) and that for three doses combined was 1.88 (95% CI, 0.76-4.30). Attributable risk 1-21 days after doses 1 and 2 combined was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.0-0.25) and that for 3 doses combined was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.0-0.70) per 100,000 doses.Conclusions: No increased risk of intussusception within 21 days of receipt of the first two doses combined or all 3 doses combined of ROTAVAC (R) was detected.

TI  - Effect of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy andLVIon Merkel Cell Carcinoma Prognosis and Treatment
T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Prognostic factors and optimal treatment approaches for Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) remain uncertain. This study evaluated the influences of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) on treatment planning and prognosis. Study Design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Stage 1 to 3 MCC patients treated 2005 to 2018. Predictors of nodal radiation were tested using logistic regression. Predictors of recurrence-free, disease-specific, and overall survival were tested in Cox proportional hazard models. Results Of 122 patients, 99 were without clinically apparent nodal metastases. Of these, 76 (77%) underwent excision and SLN biopsy; 29% had metastasis in SLNs, including 20% of MCCs 1 cm or less. Primary tumor diameter, site, patient age, gender, and immunosuppressed status were not significantly associated with an involved SLN. Among patients who underwent SLN biopsy, 13 of 21 (62%) MCCs with LVI had cancer in SLNs compared with 14 of 44 (25.5%) without LVI (P = .003). Although local radiation was common, nodal radiation was infrequently employed in SLN negative (pathologic N0) patients (21.8% vs. 76.2% for patients with SLN metastases,P = .0001). Survival of patients with positive SLNs was unfavorable, regardless of completion lymphadenectomy and/or adjuvant radiation. After accounting for tumor (T) and node (N) classification, age, immunosuppression, and primary site, a positive SLN and LVI were independently associated with worse survival (LVI/recurrence-free survival [RFS]: hazard ratio [HR] 2.3 (1.04-5,P = .04; LVI/disease-specific survival [DSS]: HR 5.2 (1.8-15,P = .007); N1a vs. pN0/RFS HR 3.6 (1.42-9.3,P = .007); DSS HR5.0 (1.3-19,P = .17). Conclusion SLN biopsy assists in risk stratification and radiation treatment planning in MCC. LVI and disease in SLNs, independently associated with worse survival, constitute markers of high-risk disease warranting consideration for investigational studies.

TI  - Assessment of wetlands to evaluate aquatic environment: a case study in Floodplain of Himalayan foothill region
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In floodplain wetland the evaluation of aquatic environment has been implemented as an effective tool for the rapid assessment. Ox-bow lakes i.e. natural wetlands are the abandoned part of the former meander are common features developed in floodplain. The northern portion of Coochbehar district is under the Tarai belt and the southern portion lies under the alluvial plain physiographic region. The Tarai zone is composed of alternate layers of clay and sand, with a high water table that creates many wetlands. Many natural wetlands in the form of ox-bow lakes have been formed in Tufanganj C.D. Blocks which are locally known as beel or baor. These beels are the abandoned channels of Raidak I, Gadadhar, Kaljani, and Mora Raidak River. Due to the geological and geomorphological set up of this region the rivers mentioned above frequently change their course. Topographical, Geomorphological and Geohydrological maps have been used to know the spatial distribution of wetlands and physiographic set up of the region. Many beels have evolved which are ecologically very much productive. With the help of the Oakton multi parameter and WTW DO meter wetland index has been prepared in some of the beels to analyze the physico-chemical properties of wetlands and to assess the ecological importance as well as human intervention. Thermal bands of Landsat image (OLI/TIRS) have also been used to assess the temperature distribution of the land and wetlands. This paper investigates the role of wetland hydrology to evaluate aquatic environment for the wetland assessment in the floodplain regime.

TI  - Direct evidence of poison-driven widespread population decline in a wild vertebrate
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Toxicants such as organochlorine insecticides, lead ammunition, and veterinary drugs have caused severe wildlife poisoning, pushing the populations of several apex species to the edge of extinction. These prime cases epitomize the serious threat that wildlife poisoning poses to biodiversity. Much of the evidence on population effects of wildlife poisoning rests on assessments con-ducted at an individual level, from which population-level effects are inferred. Contrastingly, we demonstrate a straightforward relation-ship between poison-induced individual mortality and population changes in the threatened red kite (Milvus milvus). By linking field data of 1,075 poisoned red kites to changes in occupancy and abun-dance across 274 sites (10 x 10-km squares) over a 20-y time frame, we show a clear relationship between red kite poisoning and the decline of its breeding population in Spain, including local extinc-tions. Our results further support the species listing as endangered, after a breeding population decline of 31% to 43% in two decades of this once-abundant raptor. Given that poisoning threatens the global populations of more than 2,600 animal species worldwide, a greater understanding of its population-level effects may aid biodi-versity conservation through increased regulatory control of chem-ical substances. Our results illustrate the great potential of long-term and large-scale on-ground monitoring to assist in this task.

TI  - MDMA-related presentations to the emergency departments of the European Drug Emergencies Network plus (Euro-DEN Plus) over the four-year period 2014-2017
T2  - CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) remains one of the most commonly used recreational drugs in Europe. Monitoring of Emergency Department (ED) presentations with acute toxicity associated with MDMA is important to determine trends in MDMA use and harms. Methods Data were extracted from the European Drug Emergencies Network (Euro-DEN) Plus database for all ED presentations with acute toxicity involving MDMA use, alone or in combination with other substances, between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2017. Geographical distribution, time trends, patient demographics, clinical features, management and outcome were analysed. Results Out of 23,947 presentations, 2013 (8.4%) involved MDMA, used alone (88, 4.4%) or with other substances (1925, 95.6%). The proportion of MDMA presentations varied by country, from over 15% in France to less than 5% in Norway. For the 15 sentinel centres where data were available for all four years, MDMA-related presentations peaked in 2016 (10.4%versus8.1% in 2015,p < 0.0001), thereafter decreasing in 2017 (8.2%,p = 0.0002). 1436 (71.3%) presentations involved males. Females were significantly younger than males (median 23 years, interquartile range, IQR, 20-27 years,versusmedian 25 years, IQR 21-30 years,p < 0.0001). Compared to presentations of acute toxicity with lone-use cocaine, presentations with lone-use MDMA occurred more frequently during the weekend (58.0%versus43.9%,p = 0.02), were more frequently medically discharged directly from the ED (74.7%versus62.4%,p = 0.03), and less frequently received sedation (43.5%versus66.5%,p = 0.003). Conclusions This large multicentre series of MDMA presentations to EDs showed geographical variation and changes in time trends and in patient demographics. Triangulation with data from complementary sources including seizures, prevalence of use and wastewater analysis, will enable a greater understanding of the public health implications of MDMA use in Europe.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Topoclimate depends on specifically local-scale climatic features caused by the interrelations between topography, water, soil, and land cover. The main purpose of this study is to identify, characterize, and delimit the range of topoclimate types at the Drawa National Park (DPN) and to estimate their accuracy while taking into consideration the thermal conditions of the land surface. Based on a set of digital maps, and with the use of the heat-balance Paszynski method, seven types of topoclimate were distinguished. Next, with the use of Landsat 8 and Terra satellite images, the DPN's land surface temperature (LST) was calculated. The estimation of LST using the distinguished types of topoclimate allowed for determining their degree of quantity diversification as well as assessing the differences between those types. The obtained LST values indicated statistically significant differences between the medians of LST values for almost all of the distinguished topoclimate types, thereby confirming the suitability of the applied topoclimate determination procedure.

TI  - 'He passed away because of cutting down a fig tree': The similarity between people and trees in Jewish symbolism, mysticism and halakhic practice
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparing people to trees is a customary and common practice in Jewish tradition. The current article examines the roots and the development of the image of people as trees in Jewish sources, from biblical times to recent generations (Bible, classical rabbinical literature, medieval to modern rabbinic literature and popular culture), as related to the prohibition against destroying fruit trees. The similarity between humans and trees in the Jewish religion and culture was firstly suggested in biblical literature as a conceptual-symbolic element. However, since the Amoraic period (3rd-5th centuries CE), this similarity was transformed to a resemblance bearing mystical and Halakhic (Jewish Law) implications. Various sources in rabbinical literature describe trees as humans that may be spoken to or yelled at to produce fruit. Cutting down a tree was perceived by the rabbis of the Talmud (3rd-5th centuries CE) not only as an unethical act or vandalism, but also as a hazard: the death of the tree corresponds to the death of the person who resembles it. All societies, cultures and religions have a system of values and practices that are aimed at shaping people, society and the environment according to a certain worldview.

TI  - Evaluation of three new surface irrigation parameterizations in the WRF-ARW v3.8.1 model: the Po Valley (Italy) case study
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation is a method of land management that can affect the local climate. Recent literature shows that it affects mostly the near-surface variables and it is associated with an irrigation cooling effect. However, there is no common parameterization that also accounts for a realistic water amount, and this factor could ascribe one cause to the different impacts found in previous studies. This work aims to introduce three new surface irrigation parameterizations within the WRF-ARW model (v3.8.1) that consider different evaporative processes. The parameterizations are tested on one of the regions where global studies disagree on the signal of irrigation: the Mediterranean area and in particular the Po Valley. Three sets of experiments are performed using the same irrigation water amount of 5.7mmd(-1), derived from Eurostat data. Two complementary validations are performed for July 2015: monthly mean, minimum, and maximum temperature with ground stations and potential evapotranspiration with the MODIS product. All tests show that for both mean and maximum temperature, as well as potential evapotranspiration simulated fields approximate observation-based values better when using the irrigation parameterizations. This study addresses the sensitivity of the results to human-decision assumptions of the parameterizations: start time, length, and frequency. The main impact of irrigation on surface variables such as soil moisture is due to the parameterization choice itself affecting evaporation, rather than the timing. Moreover, on average, the atmosphere and soil variables are not very sensitive to the parameterization assumptions for realistic timing and length.

TI  - Using remote sensing techniques to interpret geomorphological features along the east coast of the Red Sea, at Yanbu, Saudi Arabia
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Yanbu is the second largest port and population settlement on the Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast. With the increasing development of its nearby coast, the geomorphological characteristics of the region must be studied in detail in order to inform future developments of the region. This study examines the region's suitability for future development. A high-resolution map of the coastal area under study was drawn by analysing Shuttle Radar Topography Mission-Digital Elevation Model (SRTM-DEM) data and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer-Digital Elevation Model (ASTER-DEM) data, using remote sensing images from Landsat satellites. Landsat ETM+ images taken in 2000 and 2015, alongside remote sensing analyses, field observations, and geological mapping, were used to describe the geomorphological and topographical characteristics of the Yanbu coast. Both principal component analysis (PCA) and false colour composite (FCC) were the most effective remote sensing techniques for mapping the geomorphological characteristics of the coastal plain. The true colour of the combination bands 3, 2, and 1 was the best at showing the areas and features of coral reefs. Thus, the main geomorphological units in the study area were identified, including wadi systems, dunes, alluvial fans and fan deltas, fluvial terraces, sabkhas, coral reefs, platform reefs, islands, sharms, and sea heads.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In geosciences, field observations, and survey, remote sensing applications and data analysis still need to find out a seamless approach of integration, interlinking, and storing environment. Most applications of geomatic tools in geological studies (mainly in southern countries) focus on getting information of the real world from satellite data, but do not specify the concept of the way to represent them. However, heterogeneity exists in data form of different geological components (e.g., petrography and structure analysis), measurements, spatial analysis, and classification, which make the property and relation in the perspective of integration and management non-trivial aspect. However, this paper is an attempt to figure out a geo-data management approach by using the geo-information system (GIS). The case study is South Eastern Desert, Egypt, which built up of Neoproterozoic basement rocks and experienced successive deformations. We proposed to capture different geological data and processed digital images, together with conceptual model, to facilitate a geo-spatial framework and improve the exploration and detection of lithologies, lineaments features, and find out its interlink. Therefore, the lineament number percentage and the lineament length percentage could be used as significance of rock unit chronology, where the digital foot prints of Neoproterozoic basement rocks were created.

TI  - Instrumental characteristics and potential greenhouse gas measurement capabilities of the Compact High-Spectral-Resolution Infrared Spectrometer: CHRIS
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based high-spectral-resolution infrared measurements are an efficient way to obtain accurate tropospheric abundances of different gaseous species, in particular greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as CO2 and CH4. Many ground-based spectrometers are used in the NDACC and TCCON networks to validate the Level 2 satellite data, but their large dimensions and heavy mass make them inadequate for field campaigns. To overcome these problems, the use of portable spectrometers was recently investigated. In this context, this paper deals with the CHRIS (Compact High-Spectral-Resolution Infrared Spectrometer) prototype with unique characteristics such as its high spectral resolution (0.135 cm(-1) nonapodized) and its wide spectral range (680 to 5200 cm(-1)). Its main objective is the characterization of gases and aerosols in the thermal and shortwave infrared regions. That is why it requires high radiometric precision and accuracy, which are achieved by performing spectral and radiometric calibrations that are described in this paper. Furthermore, CHRIS's capabilities to retrieve vertical CO2 and CH4 profiles are presented through a complete information content analysis, a channel selection and an error budget estimation in the attempt to join ongoing campaigns such as MAGIC (Monitoring of Atmospheric composition and Greenhouse gases through multi-Instruments Campaigns) to monitor GHGs and validate the actual and future space missions such as IASI-NG and Microcarb.

AB  - Background Universal testing has been suggested as a useful strategy for a safe exit from the total lockdown, without recurrence of COVID-19 epidemic, delivering women being considered a sentinel population. Further universal testing for pregnant women may be useful in order to define appropriate access to COVID19 areas, dedicated neonatal care, and personal protective equipment. Methods During the period 10-26 April, all consecutive women admitted for delivery at the Maternity Hospitals of the city of Milan and in six provinces of Lombardy: Brescia, Como, Lecco Monza, Pavia, and Sondrio. areas were tested with nasopharyngeal swabs. Results and conclusion:Out of 1566 women, 49 were tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 (3.1%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 2.3-4.0). This value is largely higher than Heath Authorities estimate. Of tested positive women, 22 (44.9%) had symptoms or reported close contacts with positive patients, that is were found at risk by the itemized questionnaire. In conclusion, routine estimate of frequency of positivity among delivering women can be consider a useful methods to monitor positivity at least in females in their fertile ages.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for lung cancer
T2  - GENERAL THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a technique to identify the first lymph node (or nodes) draining a tumor. The underlying principle is that as the first site of cancer spread, evaluation of the sentinel node will be most predictive for wider nodal involvement. The introduction of sentinel node biopsy revolutionized the surgical management of cutaneous melanoma and breast cancer, becoming a key component in the management of such patients. For over 20 years, thoracic surgeons have similarly worked to apply this technique to lung cancer but have thus far not had the same impact on lung surgery. In this review, we will summarize the ongoing discussions on the role of sentinel node biopsy in lung cancer, the methods for identifying the sentinel node, and the techniques for evaluating the sentinel node specimen. We will also highlight some of the pressing questions investigators should consider when designing a trial for sentinel node mapping. This will clarify the current status of sentinel node biopsy in lung cancer and thus highlight important future directions for research.

TI  - Near-Infrared Fluorescent Image-Guided Lymphatic Mapping in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Recently, the feasibility of near-infrared (NIR) image-guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has been tested in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate whether SLN mapping can be used to identify mediastinal lymph node metastases during minimally invasive esophagectomy and explore the lymphatic drainage pattern of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) using NIR fluorescent imaging. Patients and Methods A total of 21 patients diagnosed with cT1-3 stage ESCC were enrolled. Patients received submucosal injection of indocyanine green diluted with sodium chloride (0.9%) at the start of the esophagectomy procedure followed by NIR mapping. Results Thoracoscopic-assisted McKeown esophagectomy with NIR imaging was successfully performed in all patients. The detection rate and number of NIR+ lymph nodes were 95.2% (20/21) and 4.0 (2.0-6.5), respectively. The accuracy, false-negative rates, and negative predictive value were 100% (10 of 10 cases), 0% (0 of 4), and 100% (6 of 6), respectively, for pT1/T2 diseases; and 80.0% (8 of 10), 40% (2 of 5), and 71.4% (5 of 7), respectively, for pT3 diseases. The NIR+ region was the most commonly detected in the right recurrent laryngeal nerve (80%), and the NIR+ region was identified in the upper mediastinal zone in 20 patients. Conclusions Evaluation of the lymphatic drainage pattern and the application of sentinel lymph node in ESCC with real-time NIR imaging could be effective, especially in pT1/2 disease. NIR imaging-guided SLN navigation appears to be a clinically beneficial less-invasive method for treating ESCC.

TI  - Earth observation tools and services to increase the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Humanitarian action has rapidly adopted Earth observation (EO) and geospatial technologies shaping them according to their needs. Protracted crises and large-scale population displacements require up-to-date information in many facets of humanitarian action support, from mission planning, resource deployment and monitoring, to nutrition and vaccination campaigns, camp plotting, damage assessment, etc. Even though nearly all assets of remote sensing apply in such demanding scenarios, it remains a challenge to fully implement and sustain a trustful and reliable information service. This paper discusses achievements and open issues in the use and uptake of EO technology, from a technical and organisational point of view, motivated by an information service for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) and its extension to other NGO's information needs in the humanitarian sector. With a focus on EO-based population estimation based on (semi-)automated dwelling counting from very high-resolution optical satellite imagery as well as the exploitation of data integration (including radar sensors), the paper also covers potential service elements with respect to environmental and ground- or surface water monitoring. It investigates workflow elements in relation to information extraction and delivery by illustrating a broad range of application scenarios, and discusses first operational solutions of a customized service portfolio.

TI  - Re-entrant spin reorientation transition and Griffiths-like phase in antiferromagnetic TbFe<sub>0.5</sub>Cr<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW B
M3  - Article
AB  - The perovskite TbFe0.5Cr0.5O3 shows two anomalies in its magnetic susceptibility at T-N = 257 K and T-SR = 190 K which are, respectively, the antiferromagnetic and spin-reorientation transition that occur in the Fe/Cr sublattice. Magnetic susceptibility of this compound reveals canonical signatures of a Griffiths-like phase: a negative deviation from the ideal Curie-Weiss law and in less-than-unity power-law susceptibility exponents. Neutron-diffraction data analysis confirms two spin-reorientation transitions in this compound. The first one from Gamma(2) (C-x, G(y), F-z) to Gamma(4) (A(x), F-y, G(z)) occurs at T-N = 257 K and a second one from Gamma(4) (A(x), F-y, G(z)) to Gamma(2) (C-x, G(y), F-z) at T-SR = 190 K in the Pnma space-group setting. The Gamma(2) (C-x, G(y), F-z) structure is stable down to 7.7 K, leading to an ordered moment of 3.34(1) mu(B)/Fe3+ (Cr3+). In addition to the long-range magnetic order, experimental indication of diffuse magnetism is observed in neutron-diffraction data at 7.7 K. Tb develops a ferromagnetic component along the z axis at 20 K. Thermal conductivity and spin-phonon coupling of TbFe0.5Cr0.5O3 studied through Raman spectroscopy are also presented in the paper. The magnetic anomalies at T-N and T-SR do not appear in the thermal conductivity of TbFe0.5Cr0.5O3, which appears to be robust up to 9 T. On the other hand, they are revealed in the temperature dependence of full-width-at-half-maximum curves derived from Raman intensities. An antiferromagnetic structure with up arrow down arrow up arrow down arrow arrangement of Fe/Cr spins is found as the ground state through first-principles energy calculations, supporting the experimentally determined magnetic structure at 7.7 K. The spin-resolved total and partial density of states show that TbFe0.5Cr0.5O3 is insulating with a band gap of similar to 0.12 (2.4) eV within GGA (GGA+U) functionals.

TI  - Aircraft measurements reveal vertical distribution of atmospheric ammonia over the North China Plain in early autumn
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is an atmospheric contaminant contributing to the formation of fine particles, e.g., particulate matter (PM2.5), which induces respiratory diseases. In the atmosphere, horizontal NH(3)levels in the stratosphere, middle-upper troposphere, and planetary boundary layer have been studied using surface monitoring and satellite data, yet NH(3)vertical distribution above the planetary boundary layer within the lower troposphere is poorly known. In particular, vertical NH(3)data would provide information on the role of NH(3)in secondary aerosol formation in the lower troposphere. Here, two NH(3)profiles on September 2 and 3, 2017, were obtained by in situ aircraft measurement, plus temperature, dew point temperature, and relative humidity over the North China Plain. We also used synoptic analysis and WRF-CHEM modeling. We observed one pollution layer from 2800 to 3500 m on September 2, and two pollution layers, 1750-2250 m and 2500-3450 m, on September 3. Results show that the highest NH(3)concentration above the planetary boundary layer was 28.0 ppb at 2500-3450 m over Baoding, comparable to that observed in the planetary boundary layer, of 33.1 ppb, on September 3, 2017. The transport of clean air masses from the northwest of China led to a sharp decrease in NH(3)concentration between 2300 and 2800 m and highlighted a relatively high NH(3)concentration of 20.0 ppb at approximately 3000 m, which led to the formation of an elevated pollution layer on September 2. The highest pollution layer of 28.0 ppb at 2500-3450 m on September 3, 2017, appears to be driven by the westerly wind, whereas the lower pollution layer of 20.1 ppb at 1750-2250 m was influenced by both local pollutants of the North China Plain and a vertical entrainment effect.

TI  - An integrated strategy for the exploration of palaeofluvial placer deposits
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Palaeochannels are the ancient river courses and potential locales of alluvial placer deposits. For the present study, the palaeochannels are demarcated from the Landsat ETM+ data. Digital image processing technique was used to enhance the quality of the traced object. Sites were chosen for ground truth validation and sediment sample collection. The collected sediment samples were subjected to conventional sedimentological analysis. Textural parameters were extracted to confirm the depositional environment through the bivariant plot and log-probability curve. The heavy mineral analysis was performed to assess the alluvial placer resource potential. Among the various types of enhancement techniques adopted, Gaussian and hue saturation value (HSV) are found to be the effective enhancement tools. Palaeochannels are identified from their geometry of a narrow, linear body with lateral to sub-lateral tonal arrangement to the present channel and/or palaeochannels. The average heavy mineral concentration in the palaeochannels is up to 10.34%. Thus, the present paper advocates the integration of remote sensing, digital image processing, granulometric and heavy mineral analyses for the effective identification and exploration of palaeofluvial placer deposits in the deltaic and coastal plain environment of any region.

TI  - Personalizing vulvar cancer workflow in COVID-19 era: a proposal from Vul.Can MDT
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Since the community spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the practice of oncologic care at our comprehensive cancer center has changed. Postponing cancer treatment without consideration of its implications could cost more lives than can be saved. In this special situation, we must continue to provide our cancer patients with the highest quality of medical services assuring the safety. This article provides general guidance on supporting curative treatment strategies in vulvar cancer patients. Methods At our institution, a vulvar cancer multidisciplinary team (Vul.Can MDT) of specialists is responsible for personalized treatment of this disease. The phase 2 period necessarily requires specific procedures for both outpatient and inpatient pathways and to provide strategies concerning the management of vulvar cancer patients even in case of an eventually concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. In brief, an accurate remote and in person triage must be provided routinely and patients submitted to specific diagnostic tests prior to every major treatment or procedure (surgery, RT, and CT) or in case of suspicion for COVID-19 syndrome. The decisional workflow for these women often old and frail, have been rapidly adjusted by our Vul.Can MDT to mitigate the potential risks of COVID-19. Results The team produced two types of recommendations concerning: (1) safety regulations of care pathways, patients and health care providers, (2) personalized treatment strategies. We present a protocol that can be applied in clinical practice: the flowcharts provided, include the modulation of treatment intensity designed for surgical procedures and radiation, stratified for FIGO stage of disease and intention. Conclusion We suggest that our proposals are applicable in this setting of patients, considering anyway current international recommendations and guidelines.

TI  - Improving forest burn severity estimations with partial least squares regression and orthogonal signal correction methods in Daxing'an Mountains, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Several indices and simple empirical models and ratios of single band from pre- and post-fire Landsat images have been developed to estimate and/or map burn severity. However, these models and indices are usually site-, time- and vegetation-dependent and their applications are limited. The Daxing'an Mountains range has the largest forested area in China and is prone to wildfires. Whether or not the existing models can effectively characterize the burn severity over a large region is unclear. In this study, we used the orthogonal signal correction method based on partial least squares regression (PLSR) to select those variables that better interpret the variance of burn severity. A new index and other commonly used indices were used to construct a new, multivariate PLSR model which was compared with the popular single variable models, according to three assessment indices: relative root mean square error (RMSE%), relative bias (RE%) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE%). The results indicate that the multivariate PLSR model performed better than the other single variable models with higherNSE% (68.2% vs. 67.8%) and lessRE% (3.7% vs. - 8.7%), while achieving almost the sameRMSE%. We also discuss the spectral characteristics of the four selected variables for constructing the multivariate PLSR model and their correlation with the field burn severity data. The new model developed from this study should help to better understand the patterns of forest burn severity and assist in vegetation restoration efforts in the region.

TI  - Evaluation of the Effects of Pine Management on the Water Yield and Quality in Southern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the effects of pine (Pinus taeda L.) thinning and clear-cutting on the water yield and quality of three micro-watersheds from southern Brazil using paired- (reference site) and within-site (pre- and post-management periods) comparisons between 2013 and 2016. We inspected for differences in topographic and remote sensing data between the reference site 1 (native forest) and the managed sites 2 (thinning) and 3 (clear-cutting). Double-mass analysis and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to evaluate rainfall across sites. Using physicochemical data, we calculated the Water Quality Index (WQI) and measured the water yield, detecting anomalous events with wavelet transform. Finally, we verified differences across- and within-sites in median values of yield and WQI using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. The results from paired- and within-site comparisons showed that the management practices did not control the water yield and quality of the three studied micro-watersheds. Statistically significant differences in water yield and WQI were observed between the reference site 1 and pine-planted sites only in the pre-management period. Our findings showed slight differences across sites in morphometric parameters of the watersheds. The ANCOVA confirmed the importance of rainfall in controlling the variability of water yield over the thinning and clear-cutting sites.

TI  - Clinical Features and Prognosis of Merkel Cell Carcinoma in Elderly Patients
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) occurs primarily among elderly patients over 70 years old, but the ability to predict the prognosis of these elderly patients is poor. This population-based study aimed to identify prognostic risk factors for elderly patients with MCC.Material/Methods: The survival and disease information of MCC patients age 65 years or older was downloaded from the SEER database, and all data were split into 2 groups based on age 80 years, with overall survival and MCC-specific survival as the main outcome indicators.Results: Application of the inclusion criteria yielded 1973 patients with MCC, of whom 55.6% were age 65-80 years. Among them, 1258 were males, accounting for 63.8%. In survival analysis, factors that were significantly correlated with overall survival and MCC-specific survival were N stage, M stage, liver metastasis, and lymph node surgery.Conclusions: We provide epidemiological insights into Merkel cell carcinoma in elderly patients and confirmed that patients receiving lymph node surgery have better outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that the occurrence of liver metastasis is associated with poor prognosis. Our results will help strengthen monitoring of the liver condition of elderly patients and to perform necessary lymph node surgery within the patient's tolerance.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in muscle-invasive bladder cancer: single-center experience
T2  - ANNALS OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective In this study, the validity of sentinel node biopsy procedure as our index test was assessed and compared with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy for staging and detecting the regional lymph nodes metastasis in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Methods Consecutive series of cases with T1-T4 urothelial MIBC were included. Following the injection of radiotracer, sentinel nodes were sought using a handheld gamma probe and all hot nodes were harvested. Bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was done for all patients following sentinel node biopsy. The tumor specimen, sentinel nodes, and excised lymph nodes were evaluated histopathologically. Same as the other midline tumors, detection rate and false negative rates were calculated using patient basis and side basis methods. Results By evaluating each patient as a unit of analysis, sentinel nodes were detected in 35 of 41 patients (85%), 13/16 (81%) of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and 22/25 (88%) of the no-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (No-NAC) participants. The false negative rate was 3/7 (42%): 1/3 (33%) for NAC, and 2/4 (50%) for No-NAC patients. By evaluating each hemipelvis as a unit of analysis, sentinel nodes were detected in 53 of 82 hemipelves (65%), 19/32 (66%) of the NAC, and 34/50 (68%) of the No-NAC hemipelves. No false-negative result was found by assessing each hemipelvis as a unit of analysis. Conclusions Sentinel node biopsy is a feasible method for lymph node staging in MIBC, including patients with a history of NAC. To optimize the sensitivity, the decision regarding the lymphadenectomy is best to be based on the pathological status of sentinel node harvested from each hemipelvis separately as the unilateral finding of a sentinel node, does not rule out the possibility of metastatic involvement of contralateral pelvic lymph nodes.

TI  - Assessing channel morphology and prediction of centerline channel migration of the Barak River using geospatial techniques
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Barak River is highly meandering rivers flowing through the alluvial plains of Assam in India. However, due to dynamic system, it is found that channel being subjected to regular shifting which creates uncertainty to the habitants residing nearby the river. Therefore, it is anticipated to carry out a study regarding changes in channel morphology and prediction of centerline channel migration during 1984-2030, using multiperiod Landsat remote sensing images along with autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA). From morphometric analysis, it was found that the mean value of meander length (M-L), meander width (M-B), and meander ratio (M-R) indicates an increasing trend, while sinuosity (C), wavelength (lambda), and radius of curvature (R-C) show a decreasing trend. The outcome of ARIMA model specifies that channel shifting of mid-line is going to change suddenly either to rightward or leftward directions. Throughout the whole alluvial part of the Barak River, rightward side is recognized as major concern. Observed and predicted values have shown a goodR(2)value (R-2 = 0.89 andR(2) = 0.88) at CS-30 and CS-18 respectively. Also, lowest RMSE is observed at CS-12 and highest RMSE is observed at CS-21. Finally predicted values were generated for the estimation of centerline channel shifting between two time intervals (2017-2023 and 2023-2030), which shows that the channel shifting of the river basin will occur at many regions particularly at critical sections. Overall, the findings of this study could be used further in river training works and in understanding the future dynamics of channel.

TI  - Landscape Change and Associated Increase in Habitat Fragmentation During the Last 30 Years in Coastal Sand Dunes of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eastern Barrier of Dunes (EBD) and Southern Barrier of Dunes (SBD) extend along the coast of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. These regions have been severely altered by anthropic activities for years, mainly through the development of cities and afforestation with exotic species. We quantified the effect of anthropic activities on the landscape of coastal dunes, evaluating its temporal evolution during the last 30 years. Using Landsat satellite images from 1985, 1996, 2005, and 2015, we performed supervised classifications and obtained thematic maps for coastal dune barriers. Over these maps, we quantified the main classes of natural habitats and anthropic environments and analyzed changes in their extent and arrangement over time. Temporal analyses showed a gradual replacement of anthropic environments over natural habitats. During the last 30 years, the area impacted by anthropic activities went from 13 to 31.7% on the EBD and from 3.6 to 5.9% on the SBD. In the SBD, fragmentation along the main natural habitats increased over the years, whereas fragmentation along the EBD, although higher than that in SBD, remained constant through time. Drastic reductions of the extent of natural habitats were recorded at or near areas where anthropic environments developed. Both coastal dune barriers showed a clear advance of anthropic fragmentation over coastal dune habitats, with EBD being the most impacted by human activities.

TI  - Primary Merkel Cell Carcinoma: A Retrospective Analysis of 31 Cases in Poland
T2  - DERMATOLOGY AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine cancer that typically arises in sun-exposed areas of the skin, especially in the elderly. Significant advances have recently been made regarding skin cancers, but data on cases of MCC are rather limited as these patients are frequently grouped together with other non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). Here, we performed an analysis of the clinical profile of patients with MCC in Poland to identify major factors influencing the prognosis. Methods Approximately 13,000 pathology and medical records were examined to identify patients with MCC diagnosed between 2010 and 2019. The management and outcomes of patients with histologically confirmed MCC were retrospectively evaluated. Results Thirty-one patients diagnosed with MCC were identified. The tumor occurred predominantly in women (61.3%) and in the elderly (mean 75.6 years). Twenty-nine patients had locoregional MCC and two had metastatic MCC at the time of diagnosis. Patients in stage I disease had excellent prognosis. In stages II and III, respectively 22.2% and 50.0% of patients developed metastases. Among patients who received chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide, 17% achieved partial remission with progression-free survival (PFS) of 8.0 months, and a further 50% achieved stable disease with PFS of 4.0, 4.5, and 4.5 months respectively. In 6 (19.4%) patients MCC coexisted with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In all six cases CLL preceded MCC development. Conclusions Female gender, tumor-free resection margins, and local disease were found to be independent prognostic factors in MCC progression. Patients with hematological malignancies, immunosuppression, and those with immune deficiencies should be closely followed up as they are predisposed to develop MCC.

T2  - THEOLOGY AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Scientific Revolution started in the seventeenth century. With the appearance of some empiricist philosophers and the propagation of a mechanical worldview by some scientists, gradually and the role of God was reduced solely to being the initiator of the universe. With the French Enlightenment the role of God was eliminated and religion went into the sideline. Several important currents started during the second half of the twentieth century which had a revival effect on religion, and some eminent scientists of our era have emphasized the necessity of seeking a comprehensive worldview.

TI  - Completion lymph node dissection in patients with sentinel lymph node positive cutaneous head and neck melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Relatively few cutaneous head and neck melanoma (CHNM) patients with were included in the multicenter selective lymphadenectomy trial II (MSLT-II). Our objective was to investigate whether immediate completion lymph node dissection completion of lymph node dissection (CLND) was associated with survival benefit for sentinel lymph node (SLN) positive CHNM using the National Cancer Database. Methods SLN positive patients with CHNM from 2012 to 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent SLN biopsy (SLNB) only versus those who underwent SLNB followed by CLND (SLNB + CLND). The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival (OS). Results Among 530 SLNB + patients, 342 patients underwent SLNB followed by CLND (SLNB + CLND). The SLNB only group had fewer positive SLN, less advanced pathologic stage, and a lower rate of adjuvant immunotherapy. There was no significant difference in 5-year OS between the two groups (51.0% vs 67%;P = .56). After adjusting for pathologic stage, there remained no difference in 5-year OS among patients with stage IIIA (63.0% vs. 73.6%,P = 0.22) or IIIB/IIIC disease (39.1% vs 57.8%;P = .52). Conclusions Using a large nationwide database, CLND was not shown to be associated with improved OS for patients with SLNB positive CHNM, validating the results of MSLT-II.

TI  - A comparison of four land surface temperature retrieval method using TERRA-ASTER satellite images in the semi-arid region of Saudi Arabia
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature is a significant source of energy budget and climate information, contributing to various environmental and biophysical processes. This research includes comparing the LSTs retrieved from the ASTER sensor using the Reference Channel method, the Emissivity Normalization method (NOR), TES method and Retrieving LSE by taking the proportion of vegetation cover coupled with NDVI and integrates it into the TES algorithm. The results of derived LST from the four algorithms compare with MODIS data of 7 control points having thermally homogenous sites. The analysis showed that the four algorithms are suitable for LST retrieval, whereby the proposed emissivity-derived NDVI algorithms exhibited the highest degree of accuracy (RMSE 0.145), and the NOR had the least accuracy (RMSE 0.403). The analysis shows that emissivity derived NDVI TES method more reliant on the upwelling, downwelling and transmittance and will achieve the best results compared to the other three algorithms.

TI  - Moral education in a time of human ecological devastation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MORAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Stories of civilization and progress tell us that humans cannot help being destructive, selfish, and aggressive, which are side effects of progress requiring sanctions and engineering. It can be argued that this approach has brought about the ecological collapse we face today. The older, more widespread view-that human personality and behavior are shaped by social support-respects the dignity of the individual and of other than humans, disallows coercion and expects high autonomy and communalism. The latter we can call the indigenous worldview and is apparent among sustainable societies. To ensure the development of human beings who live cooperatively with one another and in concert with ecological systems, moral education approaches should restore the non-civilized, ancient practices of raising good children. This paper examines what moral education should look like in light of children's basic needs and the degraded developmental systems children often experience today.

TI  - Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 OLI to model benthic habitat biodiversity index
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity of benthic habitats is among the highest of all ecological communities. This study was conducted to model benthic habitat biodiversity indices using a remote sensing approach in optically shallow waters in Karimunjawa Islands-Indonesia. These islands have a wide variety of benthic environments. Two multispectral imagers, namely Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 OLI, were used. A series of statistical tests were applied in the empirical modeling using the pixel values of both images within situShannon index (H), Simpson index (D), and Shannon's Equitability (EH) calculations. The modeling inputs were sunglint-corrected bands, water column-corrected bands, PCA-transformed bands, MNF bands, and occurrence texture bands. The results indicate that multispectral remote sensing images can be used to map benthic habitat biodiversity indices. However, the difference between the concepts of H, D, and EH calculations and the reflectance value recorded by the sensor remove the possibility of obtaining higher accuracy. H, D, and EH maps derived from Sentinel-2A had varying levels of accuracy, namely 46.8%, 59.1%, and 54.5%, respectively, while Landsat 8 OLI produced these three maps with 45.81%, 57.34%, and 53.81% accuracy.

TI  - A Rule-Based Classification Method for Mapping Saltmarsh Land-Cover in South-Eastern Bangladesh from Landsat-8 OLI
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland vegetation classification often treated the saltmarsh as a single type of land-cover (LCT). Mapping the dynamic and spatially complex coastal zones using optical remote sensing is still challenging. This study firstly analyzed the spectral properties of target objects generated by Landsat 8 (OLI), formulated new spectral indices and then proposes a rule-based approach to mapping five vegetated (saltmarsh, seagrass, mangrove, non-mangrove forest, and agricultural land) and three non-vegetated (wet sand, saltpan, and built-up areas) LCT in the study area, that is, large coasts located in the south-eastern coasts of Bangladesh. The thresholds of spectral indices were selected from the newly introduced spectral indices over the method development site (Bakkhali estuary). The rule-based LCT classification process followed a set of cascade rules of image thresholding and masking, based on a hierarchical tree in order to generate detailed thematic maps of saltmarsh land-cover. Overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (K) of rule-based approach were 84.6% and 0.821, respectively. The reliability and robustness of the approach was tested over two independent external validation test sites: Karnaphuli river estuary and Teknaf peninsula and consistent accuracy results achieved: OA = 81.7% (K = 0.787) and OA = 84.6% (K = 0.821) respectively.

TI  - Numerical assessment of the urban green space scenarios on urban heat island and thermal comfort level in Tehran Metropolis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing rate of urbanization and alterations in natural land-use/land-cover properties cause many worldwide environmental issues such as Urban Heat Island (UHI), low Thermal Comfort Level (TCL) and air pollution in megacities. Development of urban green spaces is one of the most proposed measures for mitigation of UHI and improvement of thermal comfort satisfaction which causes lower cooling energy consumption and indirectly improves the urban air quality. Therefore, the efficiency of realistic and executable green scenarios in both surface and roof levels (surface vegetation, green roof, surface vegetation + green roof) on early summertime UHI and TCL are evaluated and compared in Tehran Metropolis, using coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model with Single Layer Urban Canopy Model (WRF/SLUCM). Model predefined urban parameters (the urban density and vegetation fraction) are modified before the main simulations by data of remote-sensing methods which let us define surface green spaces developmental scenarios without any change in the basic urban morphology. Results are presented for three areas with different urban morphologies (Low and High-Intensity Residential (LR and HR) and Commercial and Industrial (C/I)). Three indexes (THI, ETI and RSI) are calculated for assessing TCL variations. Generally, results show that environmental operations of selected scenarios are different over selected areas. In LR area, diurnal cooling (up to -0.86 degrees C in green roof approach) and improvement in thermal comfort condition are observed in all scenarios. On the other hand, in HR and C/I areas, the daytime cooling (nighttime warming) effect up to -0.85 degrees C (up to +0.63 degrees C) in the third scenario are simulated. TCL alterations show similar deteriorating nightly effects in all scenarios in selected regions. Averaged diurnal decrease in wind speed is another undesirable impact of green development scenarios due to the enhanced surface roughness that can reduce urban natural heat and pollution ventilations. Current results clarify that the adoption of efficient urban green spaces programs needs to consider different environmental concerns. By comparison between roof level and surface greenery, it can be concluded that the green roof approach with the least undesirable nightly effects is a more efficient approach than surface vegetation development in high-density Tehran megacity.

TI  - A Supramolecular Platform Technology for Bacterial Cell Surface Modification
T2  - ACS INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - In an era of antimicrobial resistance, a better understanding of the interaction between bacteria and the sentinel immune system is needed to discover new therapeutic targets for combating bacterial infectious disease. Sentinel immune cells such as macrophages phagocytose intact bacteria and thereby initiate ensuing immune responses. The bacterial surface composition is a key element that determines the macrophage signaling. To study the role of the bacterial cell surface composition in immune recognition, we developed a platform technology for altering bacterial surfaces in a controlled manner with versatile chemical scaffolds. We show that these scaffolds are efficiently loaded onto both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria and that their presence does not impair the capacity of monocyte-derived macrophages to phagocytose bacteria and subsequently signal to other components of the immune system. We believe this technology thus presents a useful tool to study the role of bacterial cell surface composition in disease etiology and potentially in novel interventions utilizing intact bacteria for vaccination.

TI  - Landsat 8-based surface temperature anomaly and hydrocarbon prospectivity: a study in part of Assam-Arakan Fold Belt, North East India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs act as effective thermal barriers to the Earth's heat flow from the interior to the surface. As a result, a positive thermal anomaly below a hydrocarbon reservoir and a negative thermal anomaly on the surface above the reservoir are observed. The use of remote sensing satellite images is a rapid, cost-effective and accurate method of determining land surface temperature of a region. The present study uses recent Landsat 8 operational land imager-thermal infrared sensor images to detect land surface temperature distribution in a part of the Assam-Arakan Fold Belt, North East India, using a single-channel algorithm. Two anomalous negative surface temperature zones to the south of the study area are found to be important. High-resolution Landsat 8 panchromatic image, surface geological map, NDVI map and SRTM data rule out the effects of artefacts, urban settlements, and variations in lithology, vegetation or topography on these anomalous zones. The superimposition of the surface temperature map over the previously determined hydrocarbon prospect map reveals that these negative surface temperature anomalies lie over two significant hydrocarbon prospect zones. Thus, the effect of subsurface petroleum reservoirs is evident on the land surface temperature distribution of the area. Therefore, satellite image-based land surface temperature mapping can be used as an aid in detecting potential target areas for hydrocarbon exploration in the entire basin.

AB  - This article is an attempt to compare and contrast biblical divine council cosmology (Heiser. 2008) with Thai Buddhist cosmology. The Ramakien and the Three Worlds According to King Riming are the primary cultural narratives of the Thai people. These narratives give us insight into the worldview of the Thai. By comparing the Thai worldview with the biblical worldview, we can see where they intersect and where they are in conflict. The goal of this article is to spark a dialogue for producing a Thai theological and apologetic perspective that takes seriously Thai cultural worldview understandings in light of divine council cosmology and develops new tools for reaching Thai culture with the Gospel.

TI  - Land use land cover mapping using advanced machine learning classifiers: A case study of Shiraz city, Iran
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the recent climate changes and their consequences such as flash floods and droughts, there is a need for Land Use Land Cover mapping to monitor environmental changes which have effects on ecology, policy management, health, and disaster management. It should be noticed that recent droughts caused by climate change, and on the other hand, population growth has increased the rate of urbanization in Iran, where people are moving from rural areas to urban areas. In this study, two well-known machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Complex Tree (CTree), are used for land cover mapping. An advanced supervised algorithm, namely the Derivative-free Multi-layer Perceptron (FDMLP), which is based on the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) function, is developed in MATLAB programming language. The FDMLP uses a derivative-free function for the optimization of the MLP function parameters. Three different scenarios using Landsat-8 imagery with spatial resolutions of 30 and 15 m are defined to investigate the effects of data pre-processing on the final predicted Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used for LULC mapping as well. The FDMLP classifier has outperformed the other two well-known algorithms of the SVM and the CTree for the classification of the pixel-based Landsat-8 imagery and the object-based Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m in terms of the overall accuracy and index of kappa. Based on the test data, the DNN classifier for the object-based Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m with values of 91.28 and 88.57 percent for the OA and Kappa index has outperformed the other supervised classifiers. The worst results of classification are for the DNN algorithm for the pixel-based Landsat-8 imagery.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic organisms such as bivalves are particularly sensitive to seasonal fluctuations associated with climate changes. Energy metabolism management is also closely related to environmental fluctuations. Changes in both biotic and abiotic conditions, such as the reproduction status and temperature respectively, may affect the organismenergy status. A bivalve sentinel species, Dreissena polymorpha was sampled along its one-year reproduction cycle in situ (2018-2019) to study naturalmodulations on severalmarkers of energy metabolismregarding seasonal variations in situ. A panel of different processes involved in energymetabolism was monitored through different functions such as energy balance regulation, mitochondrial density, and aerobic/anaerobic metabolism. The typical schema expected was observed in amajor part of measured responses. However, themonitored population of D. polymorpha showed signs ofmetabolismdisturbances caused by an external stressor from April 2019. Targeting a major part of energymetabolismfunctions, a global analysis of responses suggested a putative impact on the mitochondrial respiratory chain due to potential pollution. This study highlighted also the particular relevance of in situ monitoring to investigate the impacts of environmental change on sentinel species. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - RS- and GIS-based modeling for optimum site selection in rain water harvesting system: an SCS-CN approach
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an integrated approach has been adopted for optimum selection of locations for rain water harvesting (RWH) in Kohat district of Pakistan. Various thematic layers including runoff depth, land cover/land use, slope and drainage density have been incorporated as input to the analysis. Other biophysical criteria such as geological setup, soil texture and drainage streams characteristics were also taken into account. Drainage density and slope were derived from digital elevation model, and map of land use/land cover was prepared using supervised classification of multi-spectral Sentinel-2 images of the area. Aforementioned thematic layers are assigned respective weights of their importance and combined in GIS environment to form a RWH potential map of the region. The generated suitability map is classified into three potential zones: high, moderate and low suitability zones consisting of area 638 km(2)(21%), 1859 km(2)(62%) and 519 km(2)(17%), respectively. The suitability map has been used to mark accumulation points on the down streams as potential spots of water storage. In addition, site suitability of artificial structures for RWH consisting of farm ponds, check dams and percolation tanks has also been assessed, showing 3.2%, 3% and 4.5% of the total area as a fit for each of the structure, respectively. The derived suitability will aid policy makers to easily determine potential sites for RWH structures to store water and tackle acute paucity of water in the area.

TI  - Spatial upscaling of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions from exposed river sediments of the Elbe River during an extreme drought
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts lead to falling river water levels and consequently expose river sediments. It is well known that from these exposed aquatic sediments, CO(2)emits to the atmosphere, but upscaling of CO(2)measurements from discrete point measurements to an entire river system remains challenging. Naturally occurring heterogeneous processes must be accounted for to obtain an overall CO(2)flux and to assess its significance. We contribute to this challenge by incorporating a two stage scaling approach using in situ CO(2)fluxes and remote sensing data. First, by combining optical airborne data with closed chamber measurements at a representative model site during a first scaling stage, we derive land cover type specific CO(2)fluxes and identify distance to the water as the most suitable proxy for further upscaling. Second, we upscale derived spatial relations from the first scaling stage to the entire river system of the Elbe River using a satellite-based analysis. In this way, we derived area-weighted CO(2)emissions from exposed river sediments of 56.6 +/- 64.8 tC day(-1)(corrected distance proxy) and 52.9 +/- 44.6 tC day(-1)(land cover proxy), respectively, for 1 day during the 2018 extreme drought. Given the intensification of droughts in terms of length and reoccurrence frequency, this result not only highlights the importance of drought-induced exposition of river sediment as a source of atmospheric CO(2)but also underscores the ability to monitor CO(2)emissions over an entire river system on a regular basis using remote sensing.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analyses demonstrate that observation is superior to sentinel lymph node biopsy for postmenopausal women with HR plus breast cancer and negative axillary ultrasound
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of axillary observation versus sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after negative axillary ultrasound (AUS). In patients with clinical T1-T2 N0 breast cancer and negative AUS, SLNB is the current standard of care for axillary staging. However, SLNB is costly, invasive, decreasing in importance for medical decision-making, and is not considered therapeutic. Observation alone is currently being evaluated in randomized clinical trials, and is thought to be non-inferior to SLNB for patients with negative AUS. Methods We performed cost-effectiveness analyses of observation versus SLNB after negative AUS in postmenopausal women with clinical T1-T2 N0, HR+/HER2(-)breast cancer. Costs at the 2016 price level were evaluated from a third-party commercial payer perspective using the MarketScan (R) Database. We compared cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and net monetary benefit (NMB). Multiple sensitivity analyses varying baseline probabilities, costs, utilities, and willingness-to-pay thresholds were performed. Results Observation was superior to SLNB for patients with N0 and N1 disease, and for the entire patient population (NMB in US$: $655,659 for observation versus $641,778 for SLNB for the entire patient population). In the N0 and N1 groups, observation incurred lower cost and was associated with greater QALYs. SLNB was superior for patients with > 3 positive lymph nodes, representing approximately 5% of the population. Sensitivity analyses consistently demonstrated that observation is the optimal strategy for AUS-negative patients. Conclusion Considering both cost and effectiveness, observation is superior to SLNB in postmenopausal women with cT1-T2 N0, HR+/HER2(-)breast cancer and negative AUS.

TI  - The interactive global fire module pyrE (v1.0)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires affect the composition of the atmosphere and Earth's radiation balance by emitting a suite of reactive gases and particles. An interactive fire module in an Earth system model (ESM) allows us to study the natural and anthropogenic drivers, feedbacks, and interactions of open fires. To do so, we have developed pyrE, the NASA GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) interactive fire emissions module. The pyrE module is driven by environmental variables like flammability and cloud-to-ground lightning, calculated by the GISS ModelE ESM, and parameterized by anthropogenic impacts based on population density data. Fire emissions are generated from the flaming phase in pyrE (active fires). Using pyrE, we examine fire occurrence, regional fire suppression, burned area, fire emissions, and how it all affects atmospheric composition. To do so, we evaluate pyrE by comparing it to satellite-based datasets of fire count, burned area, fire emissions, and aerosol optical depth (AOD). We demonstrate pyrE's ability to simulate the daily and seasonal cycles of open fires and resulting emissions. Our results indicate that interactive fire emissions are biased low by 32 %-42 %, depending on emitted species, compared to the GFED4s (Global Fire Emissions Database) inventory. The bias in emissions drives underestimation in column densities, which is diluted by natural and anthropogenic emissions sources and production and loss mechanisms. Regionally, the resulting AOD of a simulation with interactive fire emissions is underestimated mostly over Indonesia compared to a simulation with GFED4s emissions and to MODIS AOD. In other parts of the world pyrE's performance in terms of AOD is marginal to a simulation with prescribed fire emissions.

TI  - Monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of the wetland vegetation in Poyang Lake by Landsat and MODIS observations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China, provides critical ecological functions for water circulation and biodiversity conservation as a dynamic wetland system. However, recent climate change and human activities exerted strong pressures on this ecosystem. In this paper, we applied object-based image analysis (OBIA) and RadomForests (RF) classifier to ten Landsat images to examine the land cover composition and its change during 1987-2017 low water season at Poyang Lake. NDVI time series (2000-2017) derived from MODIS imagery was used to document the changes of vegetation growth status. To investigate the potential drivingmechanismof the inundation patterns, we differentiated the spatial-temporal changes of vegetation coverage and NDVI accumulation on eight elevation bands. Major result indicates that the vegetation area increased by 15.5% of the lake area during 1987-2017. A much faster-increasing rate (58.0 km(2) year(-1)) can be observed during 2001-2009 as compared to that of the overall study period (18.4 km(2) year(-1)). Analysis of NDVI accumulation showed that 42.1% of the lake's area displayed a significant increasing trend during 2000-2017. Spatially, the increase of vegetation area and NDVI accumulation mainly took place in the 11-12 m elevation band in the lower lake center. Early dry season and prolonged exposure period after the operation of Three Gorges Dam(TGD) was themajor reason for the spatio-temporal evolution of the wetland vegetation in Poyang Lake. The Lake'swater level started to fall below 12 m before 9th November might cause a boost of vegetation growth in the low lake center, and in turn, triggering xerophilization for the vegetation in the highlands and a shift in foraging patterns ofwaterbirds due to phenology variations. The findings of this study provide a clear reference for sustaining the inter-annual stability of the ecosystem by controlling the depth of water in the lake. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

CP  - 1st Conference of the Arabian-Journal-of-Geosciences (CAJG)

AB  - Application of remotely sensed data in geological mapping has been the subject matter of many studies in the last decades. The optimal exploitation of high spatial resolution satellite imagery can contribute to the improvement of the geological map, particularly when it comes to mapping in arid and desert areas where outcrops are often inaccessible. Djanet area lies in Eastern Hoggar Shield, Algeria. It is characterized by rather high corrugated reliefs and this makes it difficult to collect samples or even get field information from the entire region. The study covers the terrane of Djanet and part of the terrane of Edembo. In addition, this region is probably one of the least explored areas of Hoggar. This is why different remote sensing techniques have been used to make geologic mapping faster and more efficient. Processing of Landsat-7 ETM+ images covering the Djanet region includes various treatments ranging from contrast enhancements to spectral enhancements, and using images in 742 RGB color compositions, calculation processing of band ratios (3/1, 5/4, 7/5) and the (5/7, 2/1, 4/2) and the application of the directional filters, according to the orientations ranging from N000 up to N180E, with a semi-automatic approach for the extraction of lineaments to establish two maps, a lithological map and another linear map. The correlation of these maps with the field data allowed us to check the validity and the correspondence of the different facies and especially to clarify the lithological contours and the identification of the majority of the tectonic accidents derived from the analysis of Landsat satellite data. The geological map obtained gives another image of the region studied and provides new information on the contacts of the lithological units and the structural diagram.

TI  - Estimating inundation of small waterbodies with sub-pixel analysis of Landsat imagery: long-term trends in surface water area and evaluation of common drought indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Small waterbodies are numerically dominant in many landscapes and provide several important ecosystem services, but automated measurement of waterbodies smaller than a standard Landsat pixel (0.09 ha) remains challenging. To further evaluate sub-Landsat pixel techniques for estimating inundation extent of small waterbodies (basin area: 0.06-1.79 ha), we used a partial spectral unmixing method with matched filtering applied to September 1985-2018 Landsat 5 and eight imagery from southern Arizona, USA. We estimated trends in modeled surface water area each September and evaluated the ability of several common drought indices to explain variation in mean water area. Our methods accurately classified waterbodies as dry or inundated (Landsat 5: 91.3%; Landsat 8: 98.9%) and modeled and digitized surface water areas were strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.70-0.92; bias = -0.024 to -0.015 ha). Estimated surface water area was best explained by the 3-month seasonal standardized precipitation index (SPI03; July-September). We found a wide range of estimated relationships between drought indices (e.g. SPI vs. Palmer Drought Severity Index) and estimated water area, even for different durations of the same drought index (e.g. SPI01 vs. SPI12). Mean waterbody surface area decreased by similar to 14% from September 1985 to September 2018, which matches declines in local annual precipitation and regional trends of reduced inundation extent of larger waterbodies. These results emphasize the importance of understanding local systems when relying on drought indices to infer variation in past or future surface water dynamics. Several challenges remain before widespread application of sub-pixel methods is feasible, but our results provide further evidence that partial spectral unmixing with matched filtering provides reliable measures of inundation extent of small waterbodies.

TI  - Examining the effects of forest fire on terrestrial carbon emission and ecosystem production in India using remote sensing approaches
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques are effectively used for measuring the overall loss of terrestrial ecosystemproductivity and biodiversity due to forest fires. The current research focuses on assessing the impacts of forest fires on terrestrial ecosystem productivity in India during 2003-2017. Spatiotemporal changes of satellite remote sensing derived burn indices were estimated for both fire and normal years to analyze the association between forest fires and ecosystem productivity. Two Light Use Efficiency (LUE) models were used to quantify the terrestrial Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of the forest ecosystem using the open-source and freely available remotely sensed data. A novel approach (delta NPP/delta burn indices) is developed to quantify the effects of forest fires on terrestrial carbon emission and ecosystem production. During 2003-2017, the forest fire intensity was found to be very high (N2000) across the eastern Himalayan hilly region, which ismostly covered by dense forest and thereby highly susceptible to wildfires. Scattered patches of intense forest fires were also detected in the lower Himalayan and central Indian states. The spatial correlation between the burn indices and NPP were mainly negative (-0.01 to -0.89) for the fire-prone states as compared to the other neighbouring regions. Additionally, the linear approximation between the burn indices and NPP showed a positive relation (0.01 to 0.63), suggesting amoderate to high impact of the forest fires on the ecosystemproduction and terrestrial carbon emission. The present approach has the potential to quantify the loss of ecosystem productivity due to forest fires. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite remote sensing data were used for mapping lithological units and hydrothermal alteration zones associated with Pb-Zn mineralization in the Kerman-Kashmar Tectonic Zone (KKTZ), Iran. The visible near infrared (VNIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) bands of ASTER were used to map iron oxide/hydroxides, Al-OH minerals, Fe,Mg-OH minerals, quartz and carbonate minerals. The VNIR bands of WV-3 were used to discriminate Fe(3+)and Fe(2+)absorption intensities. Selective Principal Component analysis (SPCA), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) and Automatic Lineament Extraction techniques were implemented. Lithological units were discriminated based on Al/Fe-OH, Fe2+/Fe(3+)and Mg-Fe-OH/CO3 absorption properties. The spatial distribution of hematite, goethite, jarosite, gypsum, calcite, dolomite, kaolinite and muscovite were comprehensively detected. Some prospective zones were identified in the intersection of N-S, NW-SE and NE-SW trending fault systems, gossan, argillic/phyllic and dolomitic units.

TI  - Spatially-Explicit Prediction of Wildfire Burn Probability Using Remotely-Sensed and Ancillary Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire is a critical process shaping the structure and composition of forest landscapes of western Canada. Spatially-explicit forest disturbance history and forest structure estimated using remotely-sensed data enables the characterization of burn probability, defined as the susceptibility of landscapes to fire hazard over time. In this research, we leveraged the Landsat archive to determine the capacity of land cover, forest structure, and forest disturbance information, together with ancillary data, to estimate burn probability. We analyzed the interactions between a number of contributing factors and identified landscapes with high probability to burn across forested ecosystems of Saskatchewan, Canada. Overall, we found that forests composed of coniferous species, with shorter trees (<3 m), low canopy height variability, an open stand structure (<10% canopy cover), and low timber volumes (<50 m(3)/ha), had higher burn probabilities. A 2015 burn probability map indicated that forests that did burn in 2015 (determined using independently mapped wildfires) had a median predicted burn probability of 81%, while the median burn probability for unburned forest area was 19%. This paper demonstrates the potential to generate detailed and spatially-explicit burn probability maps from time series remote sensing data to inform wildland fire risk modeling, management, and mitigation.

TI  - TROPOMI-Sentinel-5 Precursor formaldehyde validation using an extensive network of ground-based Fourier-transform infrared stations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - TROPOMI (the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument), on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite, has been monitoring the Earth's atmosphere since October 2017 with an unprecedented horizontal resolution (initially 7 km(2) x 3.5 km(2), upgraded to 5.5 km(2) x 3.5 km(2) in August 2019). Monitoring air quality is one of the main objectives of TROPOMI; it obtains measurements of important pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and formaldehyde (HCHO). In this paper we assess the quality of the latest HCHO TROPOMI products versions 1.1.(5-7), using ground-based solar-absorption FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared) measurements of HCHO from 25 stations around the world, including high-, mid-, and low-latitude sites. Most of these stations are part of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), and they provide a wide range of observation conditions, from very clean remote sites to those with high HCHO levels from anthropogenic or biogenic emissions. The ground-based HCHO retrieval settings have been optimized and harmonized at all the stations, ensuring a consistent validation among the sites.In this validation work, we first assess the accuracy of TROPOMI HCHO tropospheric columns using the median of the relative differences between TROPOMI and FTIR ground-based data (BIAS). The pre-launch accuracy requirements of TROPOMI HCHO are 40 %-80 %. We observe that these requirements are well reached, with the BIAS found below 80% at all the sites and below 40% at 20 of the 25 sites. The provided TROPOMI systematic uncertainties are well in agreement with the observed biases at most of the stations except for the highest-HCHO-level site, where it is found to be underestimated. We find that while the BIAS has no latitudinal dependence, it is dependent on the HCHO concentration levels: an overestimation (+26 +/- 5 %) of TROPOMI is observed for very low HCHO levels (< 2.5 x 10(15) molec. cm(-2)), while an underestimation (-30.8% +/- 1.4 %) is found for high HCHO levels (> 8.0 x 10(15) molec. cm(-2)). This demonstrates the great value of such a harmonized network covering a wide range of concentration levels, the sites with high HCHO concentrations being crucial for the determination of the satellite bias in the regions of emissions and the clean sites allowing a small TROPOMI offset to be determined. The wide range of sampled HCHO levels within the network allows the robust determination of the significant constant and proportional TROPOMI HCHO biases (TROPOMI D = +1.10 +/- 0.05 x 10(15) + 0.64 +/- 0.03 x FTIR; in molecules per square centimetre).Second, the precision of TROPOMI HCHO data is estimated by the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the relative differences between TROPOMI and FTIR ground-based data. The clean sites are especially useful for minimizing a possible additional collocation error. The precision requirement of 1.2 x 10(16) molec. cm(-2) for a single pixel is reached at most of the clean sites, where it is found that the TROPOMI precision can even be 2 times better (0.5-0.8 x 10(15) molec. cm(-2) for a single pixel). However, we find that the provided TROPOMI random uncertainties may be underestimated by a factor of 1.6 (for clean sites) to 2.3 (for high HCHO levels). The correlation is very good between TROPOMI and FTIR data (R = 0.88 for 3 h mean coincidences; R = 0.91 for monthly means coincidences). Using about 17 months of data (from May 2018 to September 2019), we show that the TROPOMI seasonal variability is in very good agreement at all of the FTIR sites.The FTIR network demonstrates the very good quality of the TROPOMI HCHO products, which is well within the prelaunch requirements for both accuracy and precision. This paper makes suggestions for the refinement of the TROPOMI random uncertainty budget and TROPOMI quality assurance values for a better filtering of the remaining outliers.

TI  - Trends in Breast Cancer Treatment De-Implementation in Older Patients with Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Mixed Methods Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Guidelines allow for the omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and post-lumpectomy radiotherapy in women >= 70 years of age with hormone receptor-positive (HR +) breast cancer. Despite this, national data suggest these procedures have not been widely de-implemented. Objectives Our objectives were to evaluate trends in SLNB and post-lumpectomy radiotherapy utilization in patients who are eligible for omission, and evaluate patient preferences as a target for de-implementation of low-value care. Methods We performed a sequential explanatory mixed-methods study by first analyzing an institutional database of patients >= 70 years of age with HR + breast cancer who received surgical treatment from 2014 to 2018. Based on the quantitative data, we conducted semi-structured interviews with women identified as high or low utilizers of breast cancer treatments to elicit patient perspectives on de-implementation. Results SLNB and post-lumpectomy radiotherapy were performed in 68% and 43% of patients, respectively, who met the criteria for omission. There was a significant decrease in SLNB rates from 2014 to 2018. Forty-nine percent of patients were classified as high utilizers and 26% were classified as low utilizers. Qualitative analysis found that the most important factors influencing decision making regarding SLNB and post-lumpectomy radiotherapy omission for both high and low utilizers were trust in their provider and a desire for peace of mind. Conclusions Despite efforts to de-implement low-value care, older women with HR + breast cancer remain at risk of overtreatment. Patient perspectives suggest that multi-level de-implementation strategies will need to target provider practice patterns and patient-provider communication to promote high-quality decision making and reduction in breast cancer overtreatment.

TI  - Air advection induced differences between canopy and surface heat islands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between canopy urban heat islands (CUHIs) and surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) at four times daily temporal resolution remains unclear. The CUHI-SUHI relationship is investigated using four observations per day without temporal averaging in Shanghai, Beijing, Birmingham, and Taipei, with 201 of 2232 CUHISUHI pairs exhibiting significant UHI differences in their spatial distributions and intensities. These 201 UHI difference cases are determined by the correlation coefficients between air and surface temperature <0.2. The SPAtial EFficiency (SPAEF) multiple-component performance metric is applied to compare the spatiotemporal patterns of SUHIs derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data and CUHIs acquired from either meteorological observations or numerical simulations. The results indicate that 81.09% of the UHI differences occurred during the daytime, and were caused by local air advection related to wind speed >= 2 m/s and land surface conditions in the study areas. We conclude that joint analysis of CUHIs and SUHIs should be conducted to characterize urban thermal environments and that current urban planning procedures should integrate these UHI differences to develop effective mitigation strategies and adaptation measures.

TI  - Gainers and losers of surface and terrestrial water resources in China during 1989-2016
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Data and knowledge of the spatial-temporal dynamics of surface water area (SWA) and terrestrial water storage (TWS) in China are critical for sustainable management of water resources but remain very limited. Here we report annual maps of surface water bodies in China during 1989-2016 at 30m spatial resolution. We find that SWA decreases in water-poor northern China but increases in water-rich southern China during 1989-2016. Our results also reveal the spatial-temporal divergence and consistency between TWS and SWA during 2002-2016. In North China, extensive and continued losses of TWS, together with small to moderate changes of SWA, indicate long-term water stress in the region. Approximately 569 million people live in those areas with deceasing SWA or TWS trends in 2015. Our data set and the findings from this study could be used to support the government and the public to address increasing challenges of water resources and security in China. The authors of this study compile data on spatial and temporal dynamics of surface water bodies across China, covering a time span from 1989 - 2016. The study describes hot-spot areas with strongly decreasing trends in surface water area and terrestrial water storage in North China and discusses implications of water resources and security in China.

TI  - Long and short-term assessment of surface area changes in saline and freshwater lakes via remote sensing
T2  - WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in remote sensing technology enable monitoring and detection of these vulnerable water bodies that bear numerous functions and ecological services beyond their intended use. As such, valuable data and information may be provided for long and short-term analyses and stored in a database for future projections. This paper initially grouped 18 natural lakes of the Konya Closed Basin of Turkey according to their salinity level. Freshwater, saline and brackish lakes have then undergone temporal analysis for every 5-year intervals via Landsat satellite images. Freshwater lake surfaces have not changed noticeably during the inspection period; however, saline waters have decreased in surface area by 32%. Beysehir Lake constituting 94% of the freshwater category and Tuz Lake representing 97% of the saline group were selected for the short-term analysis that was monthly conducted for years 2017 and 2018 with optical and SAR images to better verify cause and effect relationship.

TI  - Revolutionary poetry and liquid crystal chemistry: Herman Gorter, Ada Prins and the interface between literature and science
T2  - FOUNDATIONS OF CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Netherlands, the poet Herman Gorter (1864-1927) is mostly known as the author of the neo-romantic poemMayand the "sensitivistic"Poems, but internationally he became famous as a propagandist of radical Marxism: the author of influential brochures and of an "open letter" to comrade W.I. Lenin in 1920. During the 1890s, Gorter became increasingly dissatisfied with his poetry, considering it as ego-centric, disinterested and "bourgeois", unconnected with what was happening in the real (material-political) world. He wanted to put his poetry on a scientific footing, notably by endorsing a dialectical materialist worldview. In the communist society he envisioned, science would become poetry and poetry would become science. In his opus magnumPan(11,000 lines of verse, published in 1916), two terms are rather prominent, namelyheelal("universe") andkristal("crystal"). These signifiers not only reflect important themes, but also two friendships which began around 1900, namely with prominent astronomer and marxist Anton Pannekoek (who studied the universe) and with Ada Prins, the first woman in the Netherlands who acquired a PhD in chemistry, specialised in liquid crystal research. Whereas Ada Prins is mostly remembered as one of Gorter's secret lovers, she was first and foremost his educated guide into the complex and enigmatic world of twentieth-century chemistry research. Liquid crystal chemistry became an important source of inspiration for Gorter's work and the main objective of this paper is to demonstrate her influence on Gorter'sPanas a scientific poem After presenting the two heroes of this paper, and their work in poetry and chemistry respectively, I will analyse the role of liquid crystals in Herman Gorter'sPan, highlighting important connections with Ada Prins' research into liquid crystal chemistry.

TI  - Surface water detection and delineation using remote sensing images: a review of methods and algorithms
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Multispectral and hyperspectral images captured by remote sensing satellites or airborne sensors contain abundant information that can be used to study and analyze objects of interest on the surface of earth and their properties. The potential of remotely sensed images for studying natural resources like water has been studied by researchers over the past many years. As water is an important natural resource that needs to be conserved, such studies have been of great interest to the scientific community. By employing appropriate digital image processing techniques on images taken from remote sensing satellites or airborne sensors, an effective system can be developed to study the quantitative and qualitative changes happening to surface water bodies over a period of time. Surface water detection and mapping is a crucial and necessary step in such studies and different automated and semi-automated methods have been developed over the years for mapping water in remotely sensed images. Remote sensing sensors capture images at multiple bands corresponding to different wavelength ranges in the EM spectrum. Digital image processing based techniques for water mapping falls predominantly into four categories; (i) single band based methods, (ii) spectral index based methods, (iii) machine learning based methods and (iv) spectral mixture analysis based methods. This paper presents a review of techniques, methods, algorithms and the sensors/satellites that have been developed and experimented with to perform surface water body detection and delineation from remote sensing images.

TI  - Trace elements' reference levels in blood of breeding black-browed albatrosses<i>Thalassarche melanophris</i>from the Falkland Islands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Trace elements' concentration in the ocean is fast growing and is a source of major concern. Being charismatic and at the top of food chains, seabirds are often used as biological monitors of contaminants. We studied the concentration of trace elements in blood of black-browed albatross from the Falklands Islands, which we here show, by tracking with geolocators, forage over most of the Patagonian Shelf. Levels of trace elements were measured in males and females from two different islands. Blood concentrations of trace elements were not significantly different between islands, which is consistent with observations from foraging behavior revealing that birds from both islands foraged in broadly the same areas in the months before sampling. Arsenic and selenium concentrations in females were higher than in males. Sex-related differences in the concentration of these elements may be related to unknown slight differences in diet or to differences in assimilation between sexes. These results provide reference values for monitoring elemental contamination in the Patagonian Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem using black-browed albatrosses, one of the most abundant top predators and a suitable sentinel for the region's environmental health.

TI  - Assessment of groundwater quality based on GIS and geochemical methods: coastal aquifer of Bouficha (North-Eastern Tunisia)
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In Tunisia, Groundwater is an important water source for domestic, agricultural and industrial uses, but the deterioration of its quality, under the influence of anthropogenic activities and natural factors, limits its suitability for human consumption and irrigation. The present study was carried out to assess groundwater quality in Bouficha aquifer in north-eastern Tunisia using geochemical, geospatial and statistical techniques. The relationship between groundwater quality and Land Use Land Cover (LULC) patterns were also explored using remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS) and Landsat satellite images. Groundwater samples were collected from sixteen wells in April 2015 and analyzed for their physical and chemical characteristics. Concentrations of major cations and anions in the groundwater vary spatially. The dominant water types in the investigation area are Na-Cl and Ca-SO4. A basic statistical study, applying hierarchical classification analysis confirms the existence of two groundwater types. To evaluate the suitability of groundwater for irrigation, chemical data were assessed using methods such as Electrical Conductivity, Kelley's ratio, Sodium Absorption Ratio, Magnesium Hazards, as well as Residual Sodium Carbonate. Regarding drinking groundwater assessment, the World Health Organization (WHO) standards were applied to define sites with drinking water permissible levels. Information was loaded in an ArcGIS software and analyzed with a Spatial Analyst extension using Inverse Spline interpolation methods. Fluoride content in most samples has values as high as 1.97 mg/L, with 53% of the samples showing fluoride concentration higher than the level suggested by the WHO for drinking water of 1.5 mg/L and ratified by the National Society of Exploitation and Drinking Potable Water of Tunisia. Additionally, reported nitrate concentrations are higher than the expected groundwater background level of 10 mg/L; indeed, values are up to 286 mg/L, being hazardous for domestic use and suggesting the presence of anthropogenic sources of water contamination. The Land Use and Land Cover (LULCC) of Bouficha aquifer were changed over seventeen years. The Landsat satellite images have shown that the built-up area increased from 2001 to 2018 to the detriment of water and crop vegetation. The overuse of fertilizers on a total agricultural area of Bouficha aquifer (60%) led to significant pollutants, including nitrate and a deterioration in its water quality. Regarding the WHO and the Tunisian drinking water guidelines, this work provides substantial evidence that groundwater quality is posing a significant health threat for residents. Similarly, results show groundwater's chemical content is also unsuitable for economic activities in the Bouficha region, mainly hazardous for irrigation purposes.

TI  - Atmospherically resistant vegetation water indices using the 970-nm water absorption feature
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction can introduce errors in surface spectral reflectance, and hence induces errors in plant water estimation from remote sensing water indices. We intend to develop water indices that are less impacted by atmospheric effects for plant water content estimation based on the 970-nm water absorption feature. A simulation study using the PROSAIL and 6S models showed that uncertainty in atmospheric water vapor (WV) content can induce large variation in existing 970-nm water indices, such as WI, NWI-1, and NWI-3. An attempt was made to incorporate atmospheric WV absorption at 940 nm to correct for the perturbation due to atmospheric WV variability, leading to the development of improved indices, named as ARWI, NARWI-1, and NARWI-3. The performance of these indices was evaluated using the simulated and field spectral reflectance data, as well as Hyperion and GF5 satellite data. Results showed that the new indices were resistant to uncertainty of WV and could be used to deliver improved estimation of canopy water content, with a smaller root-mean-square-error (ARWI: 7.4 mg/cm(2), NARWI-1: 8.3 mg/cm(2), and NARWI-3: 8.8 mg/cm(2)) compared to that obtained using the traditional water indices (WI: 8.9 mg/cm(2), NWI-1: 9.4 mg/cm(2), and NWI-3: 16.6 mg/cm(2)). The water indices developed in this study, although needing further assessment in wide application scenarios, have great potential for monitoring of vegetation water status using satellite hyperspectral data with reflectance measurement around 970 nm.

TI  - Service quality evaluation of satellite data distribution system based onBP-IPA
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the remarkable advances in remote sensing technology, remote sensing data collected by satellites play an important role in many application domains, in particular the smart city. The service quality of satellite data distribution systems (SDDS) is vital for both administrators and end users. Therefore, it is of practical significance to fully understand the factors that affect the satellite data distribution service. Based on prior studies of e-service quality evaluation and the characteristics of the satellite data, a multidimensional and multi-level service quality evaluation model of the SDDS is proposed. A questionnaire was designed based on the proposed model to collect users' evaluation data. Backpropagation neural network was employed to examine whether and how factors in the proposed model affect the overall service quality. The results were interpreted using importance and performance analysis to assess the relationship between the keys of service quality of the SDDS and the overall service quality. Findings have important managerial implications for the quality management of the SDDS.

TI  - External validation and modification of nomogram for predicting positive resection margins before breast conserving surgery
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose A positive resection margin after breast conserving surgery (BCS) is the most important risk factor for tumor recurrence. In 2012, Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) breast surgery team developed a nomogram for predicting positive resection margins before BCS to provide individual surgical plans that could reduce local recurrence without increasing re-excision rates. The purpose of this study was to validate this nomogram using an external cohort and to test if addition of surgeon-related factor could improve its use as a predictive model. Methods A total of 419 patients with breast cancer who underwent BCS from January to December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Using the SNUH BCS nomogram, risk score for positive resection margins was calculated for 343 patients. The predictive accuracy of the nomogram was assessed, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the nomogram's predictive variables. Results The positive resection margin rate of the current external validation cohort was 13.5% (46 out of 343), compared to 14.6% (151 out of 1034) of the original study. The discrimination power of the SNUH BCS nomogram as measure by area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was 0.656 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.576-0.735]. This result is lower than expected value of 0.823 [95% CI 0.785-0.862], the AUC of the original study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that, among the five nomogram variables, presence of tumor size discrepancy greater than 0.5 cm between MRI and ultrasonography (OR 2.445,p = 0.019) and presence of ductal carcinoma in situ on needle biopsy (OR 2.066,p = 0.048) were significantly associated with positive resection margins. Finally, the nomogram score was re-calculated by adding each surgeon's resection margin positive rate as odds ratio and the AUC was increased to 0.733. Conclusions Validation of the SNUH BCS nomogram was not successful in the current study as much as its original publication. However, we could improve its predictive power by including surgeon-related factor. Before applying a published nomogram as a preoperative predictive model, we suggest each institution to validate the model and adjust it with surgeon-related factor. Addition of new factors to currently available nomograms holds promise for improving its applicability for breast cancer patients at the actual clinical level.

TI  - Extreme subsidence in a populated city (Mashhad) detected by PSInSAR considering groundwater withdrawal and geotechnical properties
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground deformation can cause serious environmental issues such as infrastructure damage, ground compaction, and reducing the ground capacity to store water. Mashhad, as one of the largest and most populated cities in the Middle East, has been suffering from extreme subsidence. In the last decade, some researchers have been interested in measuring land subsidence rates in the Mashhad valley by InSAR techniques. However, most of those studies were based on inaccurate measurements introducing uncertainties in the resulting subsidence rates. These researches used a small number of EnviSat data with long perpendicular and inhomogeneous temporal baseline. This paper seeks to determine the subsidence rate in urban areas of Mashhad in recent years, the threat that was neglected by the city managers and decision-makers. For this purpose, the Persistent Scatterer InSAR technique was applied in the study area using two time-series of descending and ascending Sentinel-1A acquisitions between 2014 and 2017. The results demonstrated the maximum line-of-sight deformation rate of 14.6 cm/year and maximum vertical deformation (subsidence) rate about 19.1 cm/year which could have irreversible consequences. The results were assessed and validated using piezometric data, GPS stations, and geotechnical properties. This assessment confirms that the main reason for subsidence in the interested area is groundwater over-extraction. Also, investigation of geotechnical properties shows that thick fine-grained layers in the northwest of the city could strongly affect the results. At the end of this paper, a new simplified method was proposed to estimate specific storage in special cases to predict the subsidence rate.

TI  - Impervious Surface Expansion: A Key Indicator for Environment and Urban Agglomeration-A Case Study of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area by Using Landsat Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface (IS) is a key indicator to measure the urbanization process and ecological environment. Many studies have observed an urbanization process based on IS at the city scale. Understanding the changes in the IS over a period at a regional level offers an alternative and effective approach to characterize and quantify the spatial process of urban agglomeration. This study focuses on the urban agglomeration of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) by utilizing the sensor-based Landsat data during 1987-2017 and investigates the spatiotemporal distribution of IS expansion at both regional and city scales. The modified linear spectral mixture analysis (MLSMA) method is used to extract the IS of the GBA. Then, the IS mapping accuracies were assessed after comparison with high-resolution historical data. The spatiotemporal and directional changes of IS surfaces for GBA are analyzed by using Gravity Center (GC) and Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE). Finally, Shannon's Diversity Index (SHDI) is used to analyze the overall characteristics of landscape level, and the Patch Density (PD) and Landscape Shape Index (LSI) are used to describe the characteristics of different classes of the IS. The results show that the IS of the whole region experienced rapid and massive expansion during the past 30 years and exhibited a distinct characteristic along the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and the coastline. Furthermore, the IS area increased rapidly in the PRD, while it is relatively stable in Hong Kong and Macao. We believe that the findings of this study can help policy makers to better understand and maintain the sustainable development of the GBA.

TI  - Investigation of the impacts of urban vegetation loss on the ecosystem service of air pollution mitigation in Karaj metropolis, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to investigate the relationship between reduced air pollution and ecosystem services in Karaj metropolis, Iran. To the end, the trends in the concentrations of O-3, NO2, CO, SO2, PM10, and PM(2.5)as the main atmospheric pollutants of Karaj were studied. Five time series models of autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), autoregressive moving average (ARMA), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) were used to predict changes in air pollutant concentrations. Air pollution zoning is conducted via ArcGIS(10.3)by using spline tension interpolation method. Then, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images to analyze vegetation dynamics as an index of ecosystem functioning. NDVI thresholds were selected to present guidelines for qualitative and quantitative changes in green cover and were divided into five different categories. Based on the results, AR (1) and ARIMA (1,2,1) were recognized as appropriate models for predicting the concentration of air pollutants in the study area. A decrease in very dense vegetation coverage and increase in poor vegetation areas, followed by an increase in air pollution, revealed that the loss of urban green coverage and decreased ecosystem services were positively related. Furthermore, the expansion of urban lands toward the north and the west from the baseline to future condition led to great changes in the land cover and losses in vegetation along these axes, which finally resulted in increased air pollution in these areas. Thus, the results of this study can be directly used in decision-making in the area of air pollution.

TI  - Contrasting responses of black fly species (Diptera: Simuliidae) to experimental whole-stream warming
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As global temperatures continue to rise, assessment of how species within ecological communities respond to shifts in temperature has become increasingly important. However, such assessments require detailed long-term observations or ecosystem-level manipulations that allow for interactions among species and the potential for species dispersal and exchange with the regional species pool. We examined the effects of experimental whole-stream warming on a larval black fly assemblage in southwest Iceland. We used a paired-catchment design, in which we studied the warmed stream and a nearby reference stream for 1 year prior to warming and 2 years during warming and estimated population abundance, biomass, secondary production, and growth rates for larvae of three black fly species. Experimental warming by 3.8 degrees C had contrasting effects on the three black fly species in the assemblage. The abundance, biomass, growth, and production ofProsimulium ursinumdecreased in the experimental stream during the warming manipulation. Despite increasing in the reference stream, the abundance, biomass, and production of another species,Simulium vernum, decreased in the experimental stream during warming. In contrast, warming had an overall positive effect onSimulium vittatum. While warming had little effect on the growth of overwintering cohorts ofS. vittatum, warming led to an additional cohort during the summer months and increased its abundance, biomass, and production. Overall, family-level production was enhanced by warming, despite variation in species-level responses. Our study illustrates that the effects of climate warming are likely to differ even among closely related species. Moreover, our study highlights the need for further investigation into the uneven effects of warming on individual species and how those variable effects influence food web dynamics and ecosystem function.

TI  - Proximal Humerus Fractures in the Geriatric Population Present an Opportunity to Improve Recognition and Treatment of Osteoporosis
T2  - GERIATRIC ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY & REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Osteoporosis remains an undertreated disease entity causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Proximal humerus fractures are a common sentinel fracture, providing an opportunity to intervene with antiresorptive therapy before more subsequent fractures occur. Despite the success of programs aimed to improve postfracture osteoporosis recognition and management, less than 30% of patients presenting with a fragility fracture are diagnosed or treated for osteoporosis nationally. Further elucidation of diagnosis and management of osteoporosis following humerus fracture is warranted. Methods: This study is a retrospective cohort review intended to demonstrate the current state and clinical import of osteoporosis diagnosis and management following a humerus fracture at a large academic tertiary care center without an established secondary fracture prevention program. All patients 50 years of age or older who presented with a new humerus fracture between 2008 and 2014 were included. Outcome measures included: The initiation of antiresorptive therapy or screening before fracture, within the year following fracture, or not at all. Results: One thousand seven hundred unique geriatric patients were seen for humerus fractures. Nineteen percent of these patients (n = 324) were already on an antiresorptive medication. Three percent of previously untreated patients were started on antiresorptive therapy during the year after their fracture, with 31 or 2% of untreated patients starting at any subsequent point. Seventy-six percent of patients (n = 1301) were never prescribed antiresorptive therapy. Discussion and Conclusion: In the absence of a dedicated program to improve secondary fracture prevention following minimal trauma spinal fractures, recognition and treatment of osteoporosis in patients remained inadequate over time despite numerous calls to action on the topic in the orthopedic literature and public health initiatives. Undertreatment of osteoporosis puts patients at increased risk for additional fractures. This study underscores an opportunity to improve bone health by aggressively screening for and treating osteoporosis in geriatric humerus fracture patients.

TI  - The natural resources potential assessing aimed at territorial planning using time-varying space data of vegetation index and LST
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research presents the methodology of mapping a situation of the natural-landscape resources of Khuzestan province in Iran using time-varying space data according to seasonal changes of the indicators of SAVI and LST. The novelty of this research is the combined use of GIS techniques, optical and thermal remote sensing for mapping the situation of the natural-landscape resources aimed at territorial planning. In this research, a classification was carried out for the study area based on the potential of the natural-landscape resources. The Landsat 7 and 8 materials from the periods of 2011-2013 and 2017-2019 were used to perform this research using ERDAS Imagine, ENVI, ArcGIS, and Priznak software. Variations of LST and SAVI were analyzed for 10 seasons of year from April to September. The results showed that both increasing the area of bare soils (wasteland) and residential areas and decreasing the extent of the water resources, forests, and rangeland in Khuzestan province have caused the surface temperature to rise over a period of 9 years. Whereas, matching of the Entisols and Inceptisols with areas having high natural resource potential in Khuzestan province was indicated by the results of this study. And also, the Badlands, Rock-outcrops, and Dunelands are the areas with low natural resource potential. It has been shown that integral indicator of the situation of the natural-landscape resources that calculated using the materials of multispectral space imagery is a stable indicator and criterion for land assessing in terms of their suitability for agricultural use. The results of this study can be used to provide a territorial management and planning in accordance with the goals of land use planning and sustainable development, by potential assessment and mapping a status of the natural-landscape resources.

TI  - An Empirical Model for Rainfall Maximums Conditioned to Tropospheric Water Vapor Over the Eastern Pacific Ocean
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most difficult weather variables to predict is rain, particularly intense rain. The main limitation is the complexity of the fluid dynamic equations used by predictive models with increasing uncertainties over time, especially in the description of brief, local, and high intensity precipitation events. Although computational, instrumental and theoretical improvements have been developed for models, it is still a challenge to estimate high intensity rainfall events, especially in terms of determining the maximum rainfall rates and the location of the event. Within this context, this research presents a statistical and relationship analysis of rainfall intensity rates, total precipitable water (TPW), and sea surface temperature (SST) over the ocean. An empirical model to estimate the maximum rainfall rates conditioned to TPW values is developed. The performance of the maximum rainfall rate model is spatially evaluated for a case study. High-resolution TRMM 2A12 satellite data with a resolution of 5.1 x 5.1 km and 1.67 s was used from January 2009 to December 2012, over the Eastern Pacific Nino area in the tropical Pacific Ocean (0-5 degrees S; 90-81 degrees W), comprising 326,092 rain pixels. After applying the model selection methodology, i.e., the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), an empirical exponential model between the maximum possible rain rates conditioned to TPW was found with R-2 = 0.96, indicating that the amount of TPW determines the maximum amount of rain that the atmosphere can precipitate exponentially. Spatially, this model unequivocally locates the rain event; however, the rainfall intensity is underestimated in the convective nucleus of the cloud. Thus, these results provide an additional constraint for maximum rain intensity values that should be adopted in dynamic models, improving the quantification of heavy rainfall event intensities and the correct location of these events.

TI  - Sentinel node theory helps tracking of primary lesions of cancers of unknown primary
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node is the first stop of lymphatic spreading of cancer with known primary. The lymph node metastasis pattern of cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is unclear and has been presumed to follow the same pathway. To test this hypothesis, data of all 716 patients clinically diagnosed as CUP in our center were collected. Methods Diagnoses of lymph node metastasis were established by(18)F-FDG PET-CT and/or biopsy pathology. Three hundred and forty-seven cases meeting the criteria were divided into three groups: pathology-confirmed primary with invasive biopsy or surgery of the suspicious lesion (group A,n = 64), primary still unknown even with invasive biopsy or surgery of the suspicious lesion (group B,n = 204), and others with no suspicious lesion or lesions who had not been sampled due to medical or other reasons (group C,n = 79). We assessed the clinicopathological features between these groups, and the relationship between lymph node metastasis pattern and confirmed primary site. Results In group A, the primary sites of 61 cases were compatible with sentinel node theory, resulting in a positive predictive value of 95%. No significant differences in age, sex, bone metastasis, or visceral metastasis observed between group A and group B, except that group A had a higher ratio of differentiated carcinoma (94% vs. 77%,P = 0.003). Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first evidence indicating that the majority of clinical CUP cases follow the sentinel node theory to spread in lymph nodes, which helps tracking the primary, especially for differentiated carcinoma.

TI  - GEE4FLOOD: rapid mapping of flood areas using temporal Sentinel-1 SAR images with Google Earth Engine cloud platform
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present state of the art technologies for flood mapping are typically tested on small geographical regions due to limitation of resources, which hinders the implementation of real-time flood management activities. We proposed a unified framework (GEE4FLOOD) for rapid flood mapping in Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. With the unexpected spells of extreme rainfall in August 2018, many parts of Kerala state in India experienced a major disastrous flood. Therefore, we tested the GEE4FLOOD processing chain on August 2018 Kerala flood event. GEE4FLOOD utilizes multitemporal Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar images available in GEE catalog and an automatic Otsu' s thresholding algorithm for flood mapping. It also utilizes other remote sensing datasets available in GEE catalog for permanent water body mask creation and result validation. The ground truth data collected during the Kerala flood indicates promising accuracy with 82% overall accuracy and 78.5% accuracy for flood class alone. In addition, the entire process from data fetching to flood map generation at a varying geographical extent (district to state level) took similar to 2 to 4 min.

TI  - Mapping within-field variability of soybean evapotranspiration and crop coefficient using the Earth Engine Evaporation Flux (EEFlux) application
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information about the spatiotemporal variability of actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa), crop coefficient (K-c) and water productivity (WP) is crucial for water efficient management in the agriculture. The Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFlux) application has become a popular approach for providing spatiotemporal information on ETa and Kc worldwide. The aim of this study was to quantify the variability of water consumption (ETa) and the K(c)for an irrigated commercial planting of soybeans based on the EEFlux application in the western region of the state of Bahia, Brazil. The water productivity (WP) for the fields was also obtained. Six cloud-free images from Landsat 7 and 8 satellites, acquired during the 2016/17 soybean growing season were used and processed on the EEFlux platform. The ETa from EEFlux was compared to that of the modified FAO (MFAO) approach using the following statistical metrics: Willmot's index of agreement (d-index), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean bias error (MBE). The K(c)from EEFlux was compared to the K(c)used in the soybean field (K(c)FAO-based) and to the K(c)values obtained in different scientific studies using the d-index. A similar procedure was performed for WP. Our results reveal that EEFlux is able to provide accurate information about the variability of ETa and the K(c)of soybean fields. The comparison between ETa EEFlux and ETa MFAO showed good agreement based on the d-index, with values of 0.85, 0.83 and 0.89 for central pivots 1, 2 and 3, respectively. However, EEFlux tends to slightly underestimate ETa. The K(c)EEFlux showed good accordance with the K(c)values considered in this study, except in phase II, where a larger difference was observed; the average WP of the three fields (1.14 kg m(-3)) was higher than that in the majority of the previous studies, which is a strong indicator of the efficient use of water in the studied soybean fields. The study showed that EEFlux, an innovative and free tool for access spatiotemporal variability of ETa and Kc at global scale is very efficient to estimate the ETa and Kc on different growth stages of soybean crop.

TI  - Independent risk factors for axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients with one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The benefit of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in breast cancer patients with one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) remains inconclusive. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors independently associated with axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data from 389 Chinese breast cancer patients with one or two positive SLNs who underwent ALND. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify ALN metastasis-associated risk factors. Results Among the 389 patients, 174 (44.7%) had ALN metastasis, while 215 (55.3%) showed no evidence of ALN metastasis. Univariate analysis revealed significant differences in age (< 60 or >= 60 years), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her-2) status, and the ratio of positive to total SLNs between the ALN metastasis and non-metastasis groups (P < 0.05). The multivariate analysis indicated that age, the ratio of positive to total SLNs, and occupations were significantly different between the two groups. Lastly, younger age (< 60 years), a higher ratio of positive to total SLNs, and manual labor jobs were independently associated with ALN metastasis (P < 0.05). Conclusions The risk of ALN metastasis in breast cancer patients with one or two positive SLNs can be further increased by younger age, manual labor jobs, and a high ratio of positive to total SLNs. Our findings may also aid in identifying which patients with one or two positive SLNs may not require ALND.

TI  - Coral Reefs of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates: Analysis of Management Approaches in Light of International Best Practices and a Changing Climate
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The coasts and islands that flank Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates (UAE)'s largest emirate, host the country's most significant coastal and marine habitats including coral reefs. These reefs, although subject to a variety of pressures from urban and industrial encroachment and climate change, exhibit the highest thresholds for coral bleaching and mortality in the world. By reviewing and benchmarking global, regional and local coral reef conservation efforts, this study highlights the ecological importance and economic uniqueness of the UAE corals in light of the changing climate. The analysis provides a set of recommendations for coral reef management that includes an adapted institutional framework bringing together stakeholders, scientists, and managers. These recommendations are provided to guide coral reef conservation efforts regionally and in jurisdictions with comparable environmental challenges.

TI  - Species level classification of Mediterranean sparse forests-maquis formations using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Essential forest ecosystem services can be assessed by better understanding the diversity of vegetation, specifically those of Mediterranean region. A species level classification of maquis would be useful in understanding vegetation structure and dynamics, which would be an indicator of degradation or succession in the region. Although remote sensing was regularly used for classification in the region, maquis are simply represented as one to three categories based on density or height. To fill this gap, we test the capability of Sentinel-2 imagery, together with selected ancillary variables, for an accurate mapping of the dominant maquis formations. We applied Recursive Feature Selection procedure and used a Random Forest classifier. The algorithm is tested using ground truth collected from site and reached 78% and 93% overall accuracy at species level and physiognomic level, respectively. Our results suggest species level characterization of dominant maquis is possible with Sentinel-2 spatial resolution.

TI  - Identifying priority air pollution management areas during the burning season in Nan Province, Northern Thailand
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In northern Thailand, biomass burning is a major source of high concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter < 10 mu m (PM10) during the burning season (January to May), leading to health concerns related to air pollution. Given the limited staffing and budget available to local agencies, identifying priority areas for management and mitigation is important. We herein developed an empirical model using Landsat 8 imagery and PM(10)data from ground stations to estimate PM(10)concentrations in Nan Province, achieving an error of < 20% between the predicted and measured PM(10)values. The satellite-derived values were then classified into five air quality levels based on criteria defined by the Thai Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. These levels were correlated with land use/land cover maps and fire hotspots with high confidence (> 80%) acquired by the Terra and Aqua satellites from January to May 2015-2019. Fire hotspots and problematic PM(10)concentrations were most often correlated with agricultural land, followed by disturbed forests and dense forests. These results enabled us to identify critical areas where repeat burning and high PM(10)levels should by prioritized for mitigation, such as the upland agricultural and forest areas of Wiang Sa District. Our methodology could benefit air pollution management in other developing countries with similar limitations.

TI  - Caspian Sea environmental variables: an extension of the Bio-ORACLE ocean data set
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The Caspian Sea hosts unique native and endemic faunas. However, it is also a source and sink of invasive alien species (IAS), with some listed among the worst 100 invasive species by the IUCN. A common approach to study biodiversity and biogeographic patterns or to predict the invasive potential of species is the application of ecological niche models and species distribution models. These are statistical methods using spatially gridded environmental data and species occurrence information. As the Caspian Sea is not connected to the world's oceans, spatially gridded environmental data for the Caspian Sea are not available in the widely used Bio-ORACLE marine data set. To address this issue, we compiled 28 ecologically relevant spatially gridded environmental variables using Kriging interpolation of point data to model minimum, maximum, mean, and range of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen for the surface and benthic zones of the Caspian Sea. Data were retrieved from the World Ocean Database. Additionally, we utilized raster statistics to create surface layers of maximum, mean, minimum, and range of chlorophyllafrom remotely sensed data. We developed these environmental variables as they were previously confirmed to be relevant for the biogeographical classification of the Caspian Sea. To allow projections of models across the world's oceans into the Caspian Sea (and vice versa), we matched our raster dimensions with those of the Bio-ORACLE data set. Our extension of the Bio-ORACLE data set with data from the Caspian Sea provides an important basis for the monitoring and evaluation of suitable habitats for native species as well as predicting the invasive potential of Caspian Sea species into world oceans. Please cite this Data Paper and the associated Figshare data set if the data are used in publications.

TI  - A geospatial intelligence application to support post-disaster inspections based on local exposure information and on co-seismic DInSAR results: the case of the Durres (Albania) earthquake on November 26, 2019
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study analyzes how a geospatial intelligence application can turn into a useful operational tool in the immediate post-earthquake phase of infrastructure inspection that may have been affected by the co-seismic ground deformation due to very strong earthquake event. As a case study, the Durres (Central Albania) earthquake on November 26, 2019, has been investigated. In order to achieve this goal, free SAR images of the Sentinel-1 Copernicus satellite in both geometry of acquisition were used to create the differential interferograms and in the next step to convert them into deformation maps through phase unwrapping and convert phase to meters. Interferometric processing steps were carried out by the open and free ESA's SNAP software. Then, from open sources, data were used to identify and localize the exposure in the affected area. By combining (overlapping) the above two datasets of knowledge, a geospatial intelligence tool has been created in which for every element of the exposure that was identified, the ground deformation that the area had suffered due to the strong earthquake was also known.

T2  - INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - El-Burullus coastal zone suffers instability due to the construction of protective measures. This study aims to examine changes in land use/land cover and to detect shoreline changes using remote sensing and GIS tools. Firstly, monitoring changes occurs in land use/land cover carried out using Landsat and SPOT images over the years (1984, 2001, 2012 and 2017). The results of the change detection revealed that the lake area has been decreased by 7.23% due to the continuous increase in the urban area around the lake. Fish ponds incredibly increased by a huge percentage of 432.19%. The agricultural area has increased slightly to 7.94%. On the other hand, it is concluded that the maximum rate during the period (2001-2012) is 46.7 m/year due to the construction of hard protection on the west side which resulted in downdrift erosion (eastern side) with a maximum rate of 32 m/year. It is found that the maximum erosion rate was 38.3 m/year on the eastern side between 2012 and 2017, while the maximum erosion rate on the western side was 48.65 m/year.

TI  - Characterisation of a hand-held CZT-based gamma camera for<SUP>177</SUP>Lu imaging
T2  - EJNMMI PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Currently, hand-held gamma cameras are being developed for(99m)Tc imaging, mainly for sentinel lymph node detection. These cameras offer advantages, such as mobility and ease of access, and may be useful also for other applications such as biokinetic studies in animals or for imaging of small, superficial structures in patients. In this work, the suitability of a CZT-based hand-held camera for(177)Lu imaging is investigated. The energy response of CZT-based detectors combined with the multiple photon emissions of(177)Lu poses new challenges compared to(99m)Tc imaging, and a thorough camera characterisation is thus warranted. Methods Three collimators (LEHR, LEHS, and MEGP) and three energy windows (55 keV, 113 keV, and 208 keV) are investigated. Characterised camera properties include the system spatial resolution, energy resolution, sensitivity, image uniformity, septal penetration, and temperature dependence. Characterisations are made starting from NEMA guidelines when applicable, with adjustments made when required. The applicability of the camera is demonstrated by imaging of a superficially located tumour in a patient undergoing [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-TATE therapy. Results Overall, the results are encouraging. Compared to a conventional gamma camera, the hand-held camera generally has a higher sensitivity for a given collimator. For source-collimator distances below 3 cm, the spatial resolution FWHM is within 6 mm for the LEHR and MEGP collimators. Before uniformity correction, the central field-of-view integral uniformity shows best results for the 113-keV window, with values obtained between 11 and 14%. The corresponding values after uniformity correction are within 3%. Effects of septal penetration are observed but are manageable with a proper combination of collimator and energy window setting. Septal penetration and collimator scatter not only affect the 208-keV window but also contribute with counts in lower windows due to energy-tailing effects. The patient study revealed non-uniform uptake patterns in a region that appeared uniform in a conventional gamma camera image. Conclusions The results show that the hand-held camera can be used for(177)Lu imaging. A 113-keV energy window combined with LEHR or MEGP collimators provides the best image system characteristics.

TI  - Assessment of VIIRS 375 m active fire using tropical peatland combustion algorithm applied to Landsat-8 over Indonesia's peatlands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - VIIRS 375 m active fire data (VNP14IMG), the highest spatial resolution available cost-free fire product, were assessed for representing fire in typical degraded tropical peatlands in Indonesia. The results of applying the Tropical Peatland Combustion Algorithm to Landsat-8 (ToPeCAl-L8) daytime imagery were utilised as the fire references. To permit the comparison of non-simultaneous VNP14IMG and ToPeCAl-L8, peatland fire propagation speeds resulting from previous study using TET-1 data in Central Kalimantan's peatlands were utilised. Most peatland fires were still within 750 m from their source over 15 h under uniform conditions, except for very large fires. The detection rates of nighttime VNP14IMG compared with ToPeCAl-L8 showed about 80% agreement for small fire areas (< 14 ha). For fires larger than 14 ha, a dissolved 375 m buffer (cluster buffer) of VNP14IMG active fires with an integration of nighttime and daytime acquisitions, produced a probability of detection up to 90%. These results generated a recommendation for implementing cluster buffer analysis and integration of nighttime and daytime analysis of VNP14IMG data for better accuracy in fire detection for ground fire management. They also demonstrate the utility of the ToPeCAl-L8 algorithm with VIIRS 375 m active fire data.

TI  - Large Increase in Atmospheric Methane over West Siberian Wetlands during Summer Detected from Space
T2  - SOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Although wetlands are the largest natural source of atmospheric methane, the amount and variability of methane emissions from wetlands still have large uncertainty. We investigated the local growth rate of the column-averaged methane dry air mole fraction (XCH4) in Siberia where wetlands are widely abundant using 11-year (2009-2019) Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) data. While the mean growth rate during the summer from the GOSAT observations is 7.2 ppb yr(-1) globally, that in West Siberia is 8.4 ppb yr(-1). In particular, the growth rates in West Siberia after 2013 is much larger in July and August than in the other months. Moreover, the growth of XCH4 in West Siberia appears to larger than in the other boreal areas. These results imply that methane emissions from wetlands in West Siberia increased during the summer in recent several years.

TI  - APIFLAME v2.0 biomass burning emissions model: impact of refined input parameters on atmospheric concentration in Portugal in summer 2016
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning emissions are a major source of trace gases and aerosols. Wildfires being highly variable in time and space, calculating emissions requires a numerical tool able to estimate fluxes at the kilometer scale and with an hourly time step. Here, the APIFLAME model version 2.0 is presented. It is structured to be modular in terms of input databases and processing methods. The main evolution compared to version 1.0 is the possibility of merging burned area and fire radiative power (FRP) satellite observations to modulate the temporal variations of fire emissions and to integrate small fires that may not be detected in the burned area product. Accounting for possible missed detection due to small fire results in an increase in burned area ranging from similar to 5 % in Africa and Australia to similar to 30 % in North America on average over the 2013-2017 time period based on the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 fire products.An illustration for the case of southwestern Europe during the summer of 2016, marked by large wildfires in Portugal, is presented. Emissions calculated using different possible configurations of APIFLAME show a dispersion of 80 % on average over the domain during the largest wildfires (8-14 August 2016), which can be considered as an estimate of uncertainty of emissions. The main sources of uncertainty studied, by order of importance, are the emission factors, the calculation of the burned area, and the vegetation attribution. The aerosol (PM10) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations simulated with the CHIMERE regional chemistry transport model (CTM) are consistent with observations (good timing for the beginning and end of the events, +/- 1 d for the timing of the peak values) but tend to be overestimated compared to observations at surface stations. On the contrary, vertically integrated concentrations tend to be underestimated compared to satellite observations of total column CO by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instrument and aerosol optical depth (AOD) by MODIS. This underestimate is lower close to the fire region (5 %-40 % for AOD depending on the configuration and 8 %-18 % for total CO) but rapidly increases downwind. For all comparisons, better agreement is achieved when emissions are injected higher into the free troposphere using a vertical profile as estimated from observations of aerosol plume height by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) satellite instrument (injection up to 4 km). Comparisons of aerosol layer heights to observations by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) show that some parts of the plume may still be transported at too low an altitude. The comparisons of the different CTM simulations to observations point to uncertainties not only on emissions (total mass and daily variability) but also on the simulation of their transport with the CTM and mixing with other sources. Considering the uncertainty of the emission injection profile and of the modeling of the transport of these dense plumes, it is difficult to fully validate emissions through comparisons between model simulations and atmospheric observations.

TI  - Tsunami Fragility Functions for Road and Utility Pole Assets Using Field Survey and Remotely Sensed Data from the 2018 Sulawesi Tsunami, Palu, Indonesia
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2018 Sulawesi tsunami caused widespread impacts in Palu City, Indonesia, including to components of infrastructure lifeline networks. Lifeline networks are key to the operation of society and are particularly crucial during post-disaster relief and recovery efforts. Understanding their vulnerability to tsunami hazards is important for disaster risk reduction, but is an understudied topic. This study uses field survey and remotely sensed data to develop a single dataset, used to create tsunami fragility functions for road and utility pole assets in Palu. Tsunami inundation depths were estimated at component locations from a spatial interpolation of field measured flow depths and wave run-up. Component attributes and geometries exposed to tsunami inundation were compiled from both field surveys and remote sensing on satellite imagery and 'street view' imagery, which included component construction material, capacity (roads) and height (poles). Roads demonstrate a 0.16 probability of exceeding complete damage at 2 m inundation depth, while utility poles see a 0.47 probability. The probability of exceeding complete damage at 2 m inundation depth for concrete, asphalt, collector and local roads is 0.34, 0.17, 0.19 and 0.13 respectively, and for concrete, steel, steel < 5 m height and steel > 5 m height utility poles is 0.42, 0.48, 0.49 and 0.47 respectively. When comparing the synthesised tsunami fragility functions to those from other global events, Palu roads were more vulnerable at 2 m inundation depth (0.16) compared to roads exposed to the 2011 Tohoku tsunami in Japan (0.06) and 2015 Illapel tsunami in Chile (0.05).

TI  - Low seasonal variation in greater mouse-eared bat (<i>Myotis myotis</i>) blood parameters
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis) is a flagship species for the protection of hibernation and summer maternity roosts in the Western Palearctic region. A range of pathogenic agents is known to put pressure on populations, including the white-nose syndrome fungus, for which the species shows the highest prevalence and infection intensity of all European bat species. Here, we perform analysis of blood parameters characteristic for the species during its natural annual life cycle in order to establish reference values. Despite sexual dimorphism and some univariate differences, the overall multivariate pattern suggests low seasonal variation with homeostatic mechanisms effectively regulating haematology and blood biochemistry ranges. Overall, the species displayed a high haematocrit and haemoglobin content and high concentration of urea, while blood glucose levels in swarming and hibernating bats ranged from hypo- to normoglycaemic. Unlike blood pH, concentrations of electrolytes were wide ranging. To conclude, baseline data for blood physiology are a useful tool for providing suitable medical care in rescue centres, for studying population health in bats adapting to environmental change, and for understanding bat responses to stressors of conservation and/or zoonotic importance.

TI  - Plasmonic nanobiosensors for detection of microRNA cancer biomarkers in clinical samples
T2  - ANALYST
M3  - Article
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of biological processes and have demonstrated great potential as biomarkers for the early detection of various diseases, including esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and Barrett's esophagus (BE), the premalignant metaplasia associated with EAC. Herein, we demonstrate the direct detection of the esophageal cancer biomarker, miR-21, in RNA extracted from 17 endoscopic tissue biopsies using the nanophotonics technology our group has developed, termed the inverse molecular sentinel (iMS) nanobiosensor, with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection. The potential of this label-free, homogeneous biosensor for cancer diagnosis without the need for target amplification was demonstrated by discriminating esophageal cancer and Barrett's esophagus from normal tissue with notable diagnostic accuracy. This work establishes the potential of the iMS nanobiosensor for cancer diagnosticsviamiRNA detection in clinical samples without the need for target amplification, validating the potential of this assay as part of a new diagnostic strategy. Combining miRNA diagnostics with the nanophotonics technology will result in a paradigm shift in achieving a general molecular analysis tool that has widespread applicability for cancer research as well as detection of cancer. We anticipate further development of this technique for future use in point-of-care testing as an alternative to histopathological diagnosis as our method provides a quick result following RNA isolation, allowing for timely treatment.

TI  - Influenza epidemiology and risk factors for severe acute respiratory infection in Morocco during the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 seasons
T2  - PAN AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: in order to implement an influenza vaccination program for high-risk-groups in Morocco, as recommended by the World Health Organization, an epidemiological study indicating the influenza virus effect in the development of complicated influenza for subjects with co-morbidity was required. The present study aims to evaluate the risk factors for severe acute respiratory infections caused by influenza in risk groups. Methods: this research is based on the epidemiological and virological surveillance data of severe acute respiratory infections and influenza-like illness during the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 seasons. It was realized using a retrospective series study with a descriptive and analytical purpose. Results: the over-recruitment of pediatric cases with a severe acute respiratory infection has been significantly rectified because cases of severe acute respiratory infections under 15 years old in the 2017/2018 season represent only 57.9%, whereas they represented 75.9% of the total cases of severe acute respiratory infections during the 2016/2017 season. The influenza positivity rate has increased globally and specifically by age group, clinical service and co-morbidity. The risk factors considered were significantly associated with hospitalization for influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infections. The multivariate logistic regression analysis considers male sex (OR=2.1), age >= 65 years (OR=5.4), presence of influenza cases in the surroundings (OR=0.1), diabetes (OR=7.5) and chronic respiratory disease (OR=10.9) as risk factors influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infections. Conclusion: the risk assessment of influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infections in high-risk groups revealed national epidemiological findings, particularly for diabetics and the elderly. An influenza vaccination program for these high-risk-groups becomes much recommended in Morocco.

TI  - Axillary management for patients with breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Results of a survey among Brazilian breast surgeons
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Currently, there are broadly differing patterns in the management of the axilla after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and no consensus with clinically strong evidence on the subject. A survey was performed to assess the current axillary management after NAC among Brazilian breast cancer surgeons. Methods The Brazilian Society of Mastology members were invited by email to complete an anonymous online survey and a total of 426 responses were collected. Results The majority of responders (67%) indicated performing routine axillary staging by physical exam, ultrasound, and fine needle biopsy in case of a suspicious node before NAC. Among breast surgeons working in the Brazilian Public Unified Health System, 11.3% answered that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not reasonable after NAC in their services. Seventy-seven responders (18.2%) reported performing SLNB instead of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) only in patients who are clinically node-negative before NAC. Axillary complete pathologic response is necessary to omit ALND for 42.8% of responders. The molecular profile of a breast tumor is not considered when choosing axillary management after NAC for 73.7% of responders. Conclusions Our survey highlighted the trend towards de-escalation of axillary surgery and observed high heterogeneity in axillary management after chemotherapy in a group of brazilian breast surgeons.

TI  - Re-emergence of bluetongue virus serotype 4 in Iberian ibex (<i>Capra pyrenaica</i>) and sympatric livestock in Spain, 2018-2019
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Between early October and mid-December 2018, mortalities were detected in Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) populations in southern Spain. In the same region and period, bluetongue virus (BTV) circulation was also reported in sentinel and clinically affected domestic ruminant herds. Molecular analyses confirmed BTV serotype 4 (BTV-4) infection in eight Iberian ibexes from six hunting areas, and in 46 domestic ruminants from seven herds in close proximity to affected hunting estates. Histopathological analyses revealed vascular changes in several organs, pneumonia, lymphoid depletion, inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltrate and fibrosis as the most frequently observed lesions in the affected Iberian ibexes. Epidemiological and laboratory results indicate that BTV-4 was the main aetiological agent involved in outbreaks detected in Iberian ibex populations during the study period. Sequence analyses indicated that the BTV-4 strain detected in Iberian ibex had high homology (99.4%-100%) with strains isolated in livestock during the same period, and with previous isolates (>= 98.9%) from Spain and Mediterranean Basin countries. Further studies are warranted to determine the impact of BTV-4 on the health status of Iberian ibex populations after the outbreaks. The inclusion of this species in the surveillance programme may be useful for early detection of BTV, especially in epidemiological scenarios at the wildlife-livestock interface.

AB  - Following the objectives of the mission, Sentinel-2 (S2) makes a significant contribution to land monitoring, climate change, emergency management and security, and related problems. To increase the spatial resolution, researchers have been challenged to obtain a synthesized panchromatic band with a fine resolution for all S2 bands. The capacity to collect satellite imagery with a short revisit time at different spatial resolutions increases the ability for more accurate data fusion applications. Our work presents an investigation of different synthesized panchromatic bands for producing high-resolution S2 data. We produced a synthesized environment from PlanetScope (PS) data to evaluate the performance of different panchromatic bands for the enhancement of S2 10- and 20-m bands. For this, imagery over three different study areas with different characteristics was chosen: Pakistan, North Macedonia, and Turkey. After the three different synthesized panchromatic bands were produced, we fused the panchromatic bands with the 10- and 20-m S2 bands with three different state-of-the-art pansharpening techniques. Experimental comparison between the three newly produced panchromatic bands indicates that all synthesized bands can enhance the spatial resolution of the original multispectral bands. Since the difference in spatial resolution may be critical for more detailed image classification, for future studies, we recommend investigation of the fused data for different land cover applications.

TI  - Assimilation of vegetation optical depth retrievals from passive microwave radiometry
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation optical depth (VOD) retrievals from passive microwave sensors provide analog estimates of above-ground canopy biomass. This study presents the development and analysis of assimilating VOD retrievals from X-, C-, and L-band passive microwave instruments within the Noah-MP land surface model over the Continental U.S. The results from this study demonstrate that the assimilation of VOD retrievals have a significant beneficial impact on the simulation of evapotranspiration and GPP, particularly over the agricultural areas of the U.S. The improvements in the water and carbon fluxes from the assimilation of VOD from X- and C-band sensors are found to be comparable to those obtained from the assimilation of vegetation indices from optical sensors. The study also quantifies the relative and joint impacts of assimilating surface soil moisture and VOD from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The utility of soil moisture assimilation for improving evapotranspiration (ET) is more significant over water-limited regions, whereas VOD DA is more impactful over areas where soil moisture is not the primary controlling factor on ET. The results also indicate that the information on moisture and vegetation states from SMAP can be simultaneously exploited through the joint assimilation of surface soil moisture and VOD. Since passive microwave-based VOD retrievals are available in nearly all weather conditions, their use within data assimilation systems offers the ability to extend and improve the utility obtained from the use of optical/infrared-based vegetation retrievals.

TI  - Would Removal of All Ultrasound Abnormal Metastatic Lymph Nodes Without Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Be Accurate in Patients with Breast Cancer with Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy?
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Lessons LearnedRemoval of sonographically abnormal (up to 3) metastatic clipped nodes, without sentinel lymph node biopsy, could accurately predict axillary status in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. ypT and the first clipped node status were statistically significant factors for nodal pathologic complete response. This novel approach requires validation in larger studies. Background In patients who have node-positive breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy could result in nodal pathologic complete response (pCR) and avoid an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Axillary staging, in such cases, can be performed using targeted axillary dissection (TAD) with a low false negative rate. However, identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) after chemotherapy can be difficult, and currently, it is the standard to remove only one clipped node in TAD. We aimed to determine if removal of all sonographically abnormal metastatic clipped nodes, without SLN biopsy, could accurately predict the axillary status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods Patients with breast cancer with one to three sonographically abnormal metastatic axillary nodes were prospectively recruited. Each abnormal node had histology and clip insertion before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, the patients underwent removal of clipped nodes using the Skin Mark clipped Axillary nodes Removal Technique (SMART) and ALND. Results Fourteen patients were recruited, having a total of 21 sonographically abnormal metastatic nodes, with nine, three, and two patients having 1, 2, and 3 malignant nodes clipped, respectively. Mean age was 55.5 years; 92.9% and 57.1% of patients had invasive ductal carcinoma and grade III tumors, respectively; and 35.7% patients achieved nodal pCR. The first clipped node predicted the axillary status with a false negative rate of 7.1%. Adding to this another second clipped node, the false negative rate was 0%. Pathologic tumor staging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (ypT) (p= .0390) and the first clipped node pathological response status (p= .0030) were statistically significant predictors for nodal pCR. Conclusion Removal of sonographically abnormal metastatic clipped nodes using SMART, without sentinel lymph node biopsy, could accurately predict axillary status. This finding needs validation in larger studies.

TI  - Polysubstance use and association with opioid use disorder treatment in the US Veterans Health Administration
T2  - ADDICTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims To understand the role of comorbid substance use disorders (SUDs), or polysubstance use, in the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD), this study compared patients with OUD only to those with additional SUDs and examined association with OUD treatment receipt. Design, setting and participants Retrospective national cohort study of Veterans diagnosed with OUD (n = 65 741) receiving care from the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in fiscal year (FY) 2017. Measurements Patient characteristics were compared among those diagnosed with OUD only versus those with one other SUD (OUD + 1 SUD) and with multiple SUDs (OUD + >= 2 SUDs). The study examined the relationship between comorbid SUDs and receipt of buprenorphine, methadone and SUD outpatient treatment during 1-year follow-up, adjusting for patient demographic characteristics and clinical conditions. Findings Among the 65 741 Veterans with OUD in FY 2017, 41.2% had OUD only, 22.9% had OUD + 1 SUD and 35.9% had OUD + >= 2 SUDs. Common comorbid SUDs included alcohol use disorder (41.3%), cocaine/stimulant use disorder (30.0%) and cannabis use disorder (22.4%). Adjusting for patient characteristics, patients with OUD + 1 SUD [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.82-0.93] and patients with OUD +>= 2 SUDs(aOR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.61-0.69) had lower odds of receiving buprenorphine compared with OUD only patients. There were also lower odds of receiving methadone for patients with OUD + 1 SUD (aOR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.86-0.97)and for those with OUD + >= 2 SUDs(aOR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.74-0.84). Patients with OUD + 1 SUD (aOR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.77-1.93) and patients with OUD + >= 2 SUDs(aOR = 3.25, 95% CI = 3.103.41) were much more likely to have a SUD clinic visit. Conclusions The majority of Veterans in the US Veterans Health Administration diagnosed with opioid use disorder appeared to have at least one comorbid substance use disorder and many have multiple substance use disorders. Despite the higher likelihood of a substance use disorder clinic visit, having a non-opioid substance use disorder is associated with lower likelihood of buprenorphine treatment, suggesting the importance of addressing polysubstance use within efforts to expand treatment for opioid use disorder.

TI  - RS and GIS Supported Urban LULC and UHI Change Simulation and Assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has become a major urban sustainability concern due to environmental impacts, such as the development of urban heat island (UHI) and the reduction of urban security states. To date, most research on urban sustainability development has focused on dynamic change monitoring or UHI state characterization, while there is little literature on UHI change analysis. In addition, there has been little research on the impact of land use and land cover changes (LULCCs) on UHI, especially simulates future trends of LULCCs, UHI change, and dynamic relationship of LULCCs and UHI. The purpose of this research is to design a remote sensing-based framework that investigates and analyzes how the LULCCs in the process of urbanization affected thermal environment. In order to assess and predict the impact of LULCCs on urban heat environment, multitemporal remotely sensed data from 1986 to 2016 were selected as source data, and Geographic Information System (GIS) methods such as the CA-Markov model were employed to construct the proposed framework. The results showed that (1) there has been a substantial strength of urban expansion during the 40-year study period, (2) the farthest distance urban center of gravity moves from north-northeast (NEE) to west-southwest (WSW) direction, (3) the dominate temperature was middle level, sub-high level, and high level in the research area, (4) there was a higher changing frequency and range from east to west, and (5) there was a significant negative correlation between land surface temperature and vegetation and significant positive correlation between temperature and human settlement.

TI  - Estimation of High-Resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> over the Indo-Gangetic Plain by Fusion of Satellite Data, Meteorology, and Land Use Variables
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high spatially resolved satellite-derived ground-level concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) have multiple potential applications, especially in air quality modeling and epidemiological and climatological research. Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and columnar water vapor (CWV), meteorological parameters, and land use data were used as variables within the framework of a linear mixed effect model (LME) and a random forest (RF) model to predict daily ground-level concentrations of PM2.5 at 1 km X 1 km grid resolution across the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) in South Asia. The RF model exhibited superior performance and higher accuracy compared with the LME model, with better cross-validated explained variance (R-2 = 0.87) and lower relative prediction error (RPE = 24.5%). The RF model revealed improved performance metrics for increasing averaging periods, from daily to weekly, monthly, seasonal, and annual means, which supported its use in estimating PM2.5 exposure metrics across the IGP at varying temporal scales (i.e., both short and long terms). The RF-based PM2.5 estimates showed high PM2.5 levels over the middle and lower IGP, with the annual mean exceeding 110 mu g/m(3). As for seasons, winter was the most polluted season, while monsoon was the cleanest. Spatially, the middle and lower IGP showed poorer air quality compared to the upper IGP. In winter, the middle and lower IGP experienced very poor air quality, with mean PM2.5 concentrations of >170 mu g/m(3).

TI  - Law without law: from observer states to physics via algorithmic information theory
T2  - QUANTUM
M3  - Article
AB  - According to our current conception of physics, any valid physical theory is supposed to describe the objective evolution of a unique external world. However, this condition is challenged by quantum theory, which suggests that physical systems should not always be understood as having objective properties which are simply revealed by measurement. Furthermore, as argued below, several other conceptual puzzles in the foundations of physics and related fields point to limitations of our current perspective and motivate the exploration of an alternative: to start with the first-person (the observer) rather than the third-person perspective (the world).In this work, I propose a rigorous approach of this kind on the basis of algorithmic information theory. It is based on a single postulate: that universal induction determines the chances of what any observer sees next. That is, instead of a world or physical laws, it is the local state of the observer alone that determines those probabilities. Surprisingly, despite its solipsistic foundation, I show that the resulting theory recovers many features of our established physical worldview: it predicts that it appears to observers as if there was an external world that evolves according to simple, computable, probabilistic laws. In contrast to the standard view, objective reality is not assumed on this approach but rather provably emerges as an asymptotic statistical phenomenon. The resulting theory dissolves puzzles like cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem, makes concrete predictions for thought experiments like the computer simulation of agents, and suggests novel phenomena such as "probabilistic zombies" governed by observer-dependent probabilistic chances. It also suggests that some basic phenomena of quantum theory (Bell inequality violation and no-signalling) might be understood as consequences of this framework.

TI  - Performance evaluation and comparative assessment of Sentinel-2B, Landsat-8, and AVIRIS-NG sensor imageries for extraction of road and roof surfaces using different algorithms
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization in India has been rapid over the past few decades, which results in a substantial replacement of the natural surfaces into built-up lands. We present a performance evaluation of Sentinel-2B, Landsat-8 multispectral, and AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral imagery for extraction of road and roof surfaces using proposed spectral index-based and other conventional algorithms. The new road extraction index (NREI) and new building extraction index (NBEI) are developed for extraction of road and roof surfaces, respectively. Moreover, existing spectral angle mapper (SAM), spectral information divergence (SID), matched filter (MF), and support vector machine (SVM) are utilized as angle, information, filtering, and machine learning-based algorithms, respectively, for detection of both the surfaces. The results of our study suggest that the performance of AVIRIS-NG sensor is the best in comparison to aforesaid multispectral sensors, whereas Sentinel-2B performs better in comparison to Landsat-8 for extraction of road and roof surfaces. The comparison of various algorithms suggests that proposed indices, MF, and SVM produce the best results for extraction of road and roof surfaces, while SAM and SID are superior algorithms for extraction of both the surfaces in AVIRIS-NG imagery. Further, NREI and MF performed well for extraction of roads followed by NBEI and SAM for roofs in Landsat8. Finally, NREI, SAM, and SID are found to be efficient for extraction of roads subsequently NBEI, SAM, and SID for roofs in Sentinel-2B imagery.

TI  - Channel bar development and bankline migration of the Lower Padma River of Bangladesh
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Bankline migration and erosion of banks are very common phenomenon in the Lower Padma River (LPR) of Bangladesh. Therefore, the current research focus on studies addressing issues about channel bar development; the interrelationship among number of bars, bars area, river width, braiding, and sinuosity indices; and its relation to bankline shifting using remote sensing (RS) and GIS techniques. Multi-dated Landsat images of 1977, 1989, 1999, 2014, and 2017 were taken into consideration for the research. The results reveal that the river area and the width of the river have been gradually increased at a rate of about 7.81 km(2)and 0.083 km per year, respectively, over the past 40 years. Contrary, the water area has been gradually decreased at a rate of about 1.66 km(2) year(-1). This is because the channel bar area of the LPR was gradually increasing as a result of bar formation, which is about 9.47 km(2) year(-1). About 192.73 km(2)and 327.70 km(2)lands eroded on the left and right banks, respectively, at a rate of 4.82 km(2)and 8.19 km(2) year(-1). In the past, the LPR course was less braided. But now it has become more braided due to the formation of many new bars within the river course. It is assumed that these factors intensified the bank erosion. Moreover, erosion rates have not always been the same on both banks and affected different parts of both banks of the river due to the different braiding intensities. The area of river, where more bars are present, creates more braiding, more sinuous, and finally causes severe erosion. Additionally, the bank sediments of the LPR are dominantly silty sand (loosely compact) and easily subjected to erosion. Moreover during monsoon huge water flows from the upstream naturally exert an additional effect on the bank. In summary, these random phenomena have changed the morphology of the LPR.

TI  - Parameterization of the modified water cloud model (MWCM) using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for winter wheat crop: a case study from Punjab, India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is essential for water resources management, yet accurate information of soil moisture has been a challenge. The major goal was to parametrize the Modified Water Cloud Model (MWCM). The Sentinel-1A data of winter wheat crop was collected for two weeks. Concurrently, in-situ soil moisture data was collected using Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR). A parametric scheme was used for the retrieval of the VV polarization of Sentinel-1A. The effect of NDVI as a vegetation descriptors (V(1)and V-2) on total VV backscatter (sigma(0)) was analyzed. The calibration showed NDVI has the potential to influence Water Cloud Model (WCM) and vegetation descriptors; hence it is recommended to calibrate the MWCM. The coefficient of determination (R-2= 0.83) showed a good agreement between observed and estimated soil moisture. Therefore, this approach help improve soil moisture prediction, and can be applied to determine soil moisture more accurately for winter crops, grasses, and pasture lands.

TI  - Snow cover area analysis and its relation with climate variability in Chandra basin, Western Himalaya, during 2001-2017 using MODIS and ERA5 data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers and snow cover area (SCA) plays an important role in river runoff in Himalayan region. There is a need to monitor SCA on spatio-temporal basis for better and efficient utilization of water resources. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides less cloudy data due to high temporal resolution as compared to other optical sensors for high elevation regions, and its 8-day snow cover product is globally used for snow cover estimation. The main objective of the present paper is to estimate annual and seasonal SCA in Chandra basin, Western Himalaya, and analysis of its variation with elevation, aspect, and slope during 2001 to 2017 using MODIS Terra (MOD10A2) and Aqua (MYD10A2) snow cover product as well as to correlate the same with temperature and precipitation using fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Atmospheric Reanalysis of the global climate (ERA5) data. The total average SCA observed is 84.94% of basin area during the study period. The maximum annual average SCA was found as 91.23% in 2009 with minimum being 76.37% in 2016. Strong correlation is observed in annual and seasonal SCA with temperature which indicate that SCA variability is highly sensitive to temperature.

TI  - Impact of indocyanine green-guided extended pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of indocyanine green-guided extended pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer. Materials and methods After institutional review board approval, between July 2017 and December 2018, we carried out 100 indocyanine green-guided extended pelvic lymph node dissections in patients with localized intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer, using the Firefly (Novadaq Technologies, Mississauga, ON, Canada) and da Vinci Xi surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Indocyanine green was injected transrectally using ultrasound sonography before each surgery. Then, lymphatic drainage patterns and pathological findings were recorded. Results Lymphatic drainage routes were successfully determined in 91 right-sided and 90 left-sided cases. Five main lymphatic pathways and sites were identified: (i) an internal route (57%); (ii) a lateral route (50%); (iii) a presacral route (20%); (iv) a paravesical artery site (20%); and (v) a pre-prostatic site (5%). Lymph node metastasis was positive in 15 patients, with 44 pathologically confirmed metastatic lymph nodes. Metastatic fluorescent lymph nodes were found in 15 out of 44 lymph nodes (34.1%). For sentinel lymph node identification, the 34% sensitivity and 64.8% specificity rates were detected in regard to identification of lymph node metastasis. Conclusions Lymphatic drainage patterns from the prostate can be identified and classified using indocyanine green-guided extended pelvic lymph node dissections. Although the direct role of fluorescent lymph nodes in sentinel lymph node identification appears to be limited, the identification of lymphatic pathways could contribute to high-quality extended pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

The main characteristics of these applications are the online arrival of data observations at high speed and the susceptibility to changes in the data distributions due to the dynamic nature of real environments. The data stream mining community still faces some primary challenges and difficulties related to the comparison and evaluation of new proposals, mainly due to the lack of publicly available high quality non-stationary real-world datasets. The comparison of stream algorithms proposed in the literature is not an easy task, as authors do not always follow the same recommendations, experimental evaluation procedures, datasets, and assumptions. In this paper, we mitigate problems related to the choice of datasets in the experimental evaluation of stream classifiers and drift detectors. To that end, we propose a new public data repository for benchmarking stream algorithms with real-world data. This repository contains the most popular datasets from literature and new datasets related to a highly relevant public health problem that involves the recognition of disease vector insects using optical sensors. The main advantage of these new datasets is the prior knowledge of their characteristics and patterns of changes to adequately evaluate new adaptive algorithms. We also present an in-depth discussion about the characteristics, reasons, and issues that lead to different types of changes in data distribution, as well as a critical review of common problems concerning the current benchmark datasets available in the literature.

TI  - Analysis of Urban Expansion and its Impacts on Land Surface Temperature and Vegetation Using RS and GIS, A Case Study in Xi'an City, China
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to explain the impacts of urban expansion on land surface temperature and vegetation of Xi'an City, China using integrated techniques of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS). Urbanization is one of the potential driving factors for land use/land cover (LULC) change, vegetation decrease, and land surface temperature (LST) increase. To access information about the spatial and temporal land cover change, the use of two essential sources RS and GIS is indispensable. This study focuses on LULC changes in six districts of Xi'an City, China for the last three decades (1987-2018) using Landsat satellite images. The images from Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) of Landsat satellite are utilized. The results are as follows: (1) Xi'an experienced strong urbanization over the last 30 years with an increase of 69.6% in the urban area. The urban expansion pattern from 1987 to 2002 is alternate infilling and edge expansion in central districts, while from 2002 to 2018 is dominantly edge expansion toward outer districts. (2) Urbanization has negative effects on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); from 2002 to 2018 vegetation cover has decreased sharply in outer districts of Xi'an. (3) There is a synergetic relationship between urban expansion and LST. (4) The correlation between LST and NDVI is strongly negative, which indicates vegetation can relieve the effects of LST to some extent.

TI  - Novel morphological and genetic features of fumarate hydratase deficient renal cell carcinoma inHLRCCsyndrome patients with a tailored therapeutic approach
T2  - GENES CHROMOSOMES & CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome (HLRCC) is defined by germline mutations in the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene and associated with leiomyomas and aggressive renal cell carcinomas with FH deficiency. Here, we comprehensively characterize two new patients with HLRCC syndrome on a morphological, immunohistochemical and genetic level. The patients developed aggressive HLRCC syndrome-associated RCCs, uterine leiomyomas and dermal leiomyomas. One HLRCC syndrome-associated RCC exhibited an unusual morphology with accumulation of "colloid-like" cytoplasmic inclusions, which might serve as a novel sentinel feature to trigger further testing. This case showed partially retained FH expression, initially hampering correct diagnosis. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing analyses of HLRCC syndrome-associated RCC and leiomyomas in our patients revealed divergent genetic changes in theFHgene in different tumors from the same patient. While all leiomyomas (uterine and cutaneous) showed aFHloss of heterozygosity (LOH) as a wildtype allele inactivating event, one HLRCC-RCC showed a second, undescribed NM_000143.3; c.947C>T; p.Ala316ValFHmutation accompanying the preexisting splice site mutation c.378+2T>C. In the other HLRCC syndrome-associated RCC, theFHmutation (NM_000143.3; c.462T>G; p.Asn154Lys with a somatic LOH) represents another variant of unknown significance that we link to HLRCC - and thus classify as likely pathogenic. Due to the specific diagnosis of metastatic HLRCC syndrome-associated RCC, both cases were treated in first line with bevacizumab/erlotinib and showed remarkable and long lasting responses. These findings allow new morphological and molecular insights into the biology of the HLRCC syndrome, corroborate the "second hit" hypothesis of tumor formation in HLRCC patients and may promote a distinct therapeutic approach.

TI  - Elevation change of Bhasan Char measured by persistent scatterer interferometry using Sentinel-1 data in a humanitarian context
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the elevation changes for the island of Bhasan Char, located in the Bay of Bengal, which was selected for the relocation of around 100,000 refugees of the Rohingya minority which were forced to leave their homes in Myanmar. Eighty-nine Sentinel-1 products were analysed using persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) beginning August 2016 through September 2019, divided into three periods of one year to reduce the impact of temporal decorrelation. The findings indicate that the island is a recent landform which underlies naturally induced surface changes with velocities of up to +/- 20 mm per year. Additional displacement is probably caused by heavy construction loads since early 2018, although we found no statistical evidence for this. The main built-up area shows stable behaviour during the analysed period, but there are significant changes along the coasts and artificial embankments of the island, and within one separate settlement in the north. The moist surface conditions and strong monsoonal rains complicated the proper retrieval of stable trends, but the sum of findings supports the assumption that the island underlies strong morphologic dynamics which put the people to be relocated at additional risk. Its suitability for construction has to be investigated in further studies.

TI  - A pixel-level fusion method for multi-source optical remote sensing image combining the principal component analysis and curvelet transform
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the availability of multi-sensor, multi-temporal, multi-resolution and multi-spectral images from operational Earth observation satellites, remote sensing image fusion has become a valuable tool. The goal of remote sensing image fusion is to integrate complementary information from multi-source data such that the new images are more suitable for human visual perception and computer-processing tasks such as segmentation, feature extraction, and object recognition. In this paper, a pixel-level remote sensing image fusion method is proposed, which is based on combining the principal component analysis (PCA) and the curvelet transformation (CT). First, the multi-spectral image with low-spatial-resolution is transformed by PCA and principal components are obtained. Second, the panchromatic image with high-spatial-resolution and the principal components of the multi-spectral image are respectively merged with the curvelet transform. Finally, the fused image is obtained by inverse CT and inverse PCA. The experiments using Landsat-8 OLI multi-spectral and panchromatic image show that, compared with the traditional methods such as the WT-based method, the IHS-based method, the HPF-based method, the BT-based method, the PCA-based method and the CT-based method, the results of the proposed method preserve the spatial details while preserving more spectral information of the original image.

TI  - Biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes after injection of methylene blue and lymphoscintigraphic guidance in 30 dogs with mast cell tumors
T2  - VETERINARY SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To report the outcomes associated with sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) detection and extirpation guided by radionuclide and methylene blue injections in dogs with cutaneous and subcutaneous mast cell tumors (MCT). Study design Clinical prospective cohort study. Animals Thirty client-owned dogs with MCT amenable to wide-margin excision, without evidence of distant metastasis and abnormal regional lymph nodes (RLN). Methods Technetium-99 m and methylene blue were injected peritumorally. Dogs underwent preoperative gamma-camera scintigraphy and an intraoperative gamma-probe-guided SLN extirpation. Outcomes included technical and surgical complications, number of SLN, SLN location respecting the expected RLN, and histopathology results. Results Sentinel lymph node mapping was applied to 34 MCT in 30 dogs without any complication. Sentinel lymph nodes were not identified in three of 34 tumors, all with previous scar tissue. Sentinel lymph nodes did not correspond to expected RLN in 19 of 30 (63%) tumors. Histological examination confirmed an early or overt metastasis in 32 of 57 (56%) SLN extirpated. Conclusion Sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy with radionuclide and injection of methylene blue was associated with low morbidity and allowed detection of SLN in dogs with MCT at first presentation without scar tissue. Clinical significance Incorporation of SLN mapping and extirpation allows for a personalized staging approach in dogs with MCT. The presence of scar tissue in dogs with recurrent tumors seems to be a limitation for SLN mapping with this technique.

TI  - Land cover change of arid environment in Tunisia based on analysis of Landsat images
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of Land use/land cover (LULC) change was assessed through monitoring the distribution of ecological indicators and tracking the aeolian deposits, which provides valuable information on desertification and climate change in Tunisian arid regions. This study was conducted in Oum Zessar area, in southeastern Tunisia. Both visual interpretation and automated classification approach were developed to extract sand features using Landsat images for 2000, 2008 and 2014. The automated classification includes a decision tree classifier (DT) and an unsupervised classification applied to the principal components extracted from Knepper ratios composite. The validation of the classification methods showed that the DT had an overall accuracy over 84%. The results of the change detection have shown an increase in the classes of Agriculture behind tabia by 10.68%, the rangelands and croplands by 24.37% and the mountain rangelands by 14.93%, and a decrease in the classes of Agriculture behind jessour by 33.65%, sand encroachments by 12.93% and halophyte rangelands by 3.4%, respectively. These resulting maps seem to be the suitable decision-support tools for management of land use in arid regions of Tunisia, in particular, for land degradation assessment and water and soil conservation.

TI  - Native distribution characteristics rather than functional traits explain preadaptation of invasive species to high-UV-B environments
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Alien species successfully colonize new ranges if they encounter favourable environmental conditions there and possess traits that match new challenges. Climate-matching approaches comparing native and exotic ranges mostly consider temperature and precipitation niches of alien species, but have largely ignored UV-B radiation. UV-B fundamentally differs between hemispheres, with much higher levels at southern than at northern latitudes. Consequently, UV-B might act at the global scale and present a so far neglected filter that species need to overcome when invading high-UV-B environments. Location We performed two multi-species common garden experiments, conducted in the native European range (Germany) and the high-UV-B exotic range (New Zealand) to test for preadaptation to UV-B. Methods We used 25 herbaceous species from open habitats, which we exposed in each range to three UV radiation treatments: (a) natural sunlight, (b) exclusion of UV-B while allowing natural UV-A, and (c) exclusion of UV-B and UV-A. We additionally used plant traits (TRY), global distribution data (GBIF, GloNAF) and global UV-B satellite data (glUV) to determine species-specific characteristics as fostering agents of UV-B tolerance. The joint analysis of experimental and macroecological data allowed quantification of species plasticity and identification of beneficial species traits in high-UV-B environments. Results Our results showed an overall limiting effect of UV-B in both common gardens but the UV-stress response tended to be more pronounced in the invaded range. Across all species, we found little evidence for preadaptation by functional plant traits. In contrast, preadaptation to climatic conditions related to the species' native UV-B niche was of greater importance for plant performance in the presence of UV-B radiation. Main conclusions For predicting alien species' ability to expand into high-UV-B environments, macroclimatic niche characteristics of the species' native range might be better predictors than functional traits and should be more considered in future projection models.

TI  - A Bioweapon or a Hoax? The Link Between Distinct Conspiracy Beliefs About the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak and Pandemic Behavior
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PERSONALITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the coronavirus disease pandemic rising in 2020, governments and nongovernmental organizations across the globe have taken great efforts to curb the infection rate by promoting or legally prescribing behavior that can reduce the spread of the virus. At the same time, this pandemic has given rise to speculations and conspiracy theories. Conspiracy worldviews have been connected to refusal to trust science, the biomedical model of disease, and legal means of political engagement in previous research. In three studies from the United States (N= 220;N= 288) and the UK (N= 298), we went beyond this focus on a general conspiracy worldview and tested the idea that different forms of conspiracy beliefs despite being positively correlated have distinct behavioral implications. Whereas conspiracy beliefs describing the pandemic as a hoax were more strongly associated with reduced containment-related behavior, conspiracy beliefs about sinister forces purposefully creating the virus related to an increase in self-centered prepping behavior.

TI  - Characterization of neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant influenza virus isolates from immunocompromised patients in the Republic of Korea
T2  - VIROLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The emergence of influenza viruses resistant to anti-influenza drugs is a threat to global public health. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention operates the Korea Influenza and Respiratory Viruses Surveillance System (KINRESS) to monitor epidemics of influenza and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) to identify mutated influenza viruses affecting drug resistance, pathogenesis, and transmission. Methods Oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from KINRESS and SARI during the 2018-2019 season. The specimens confirmed influenza virus using real-time RT-PCR on inoculated MDCK cells. HA and NA sequences of the influenza viruses were analyzed for phylogeny and mutations. Neuraminidase inhibition and hemagglutination inhibition assays were utilized to characterize the isolates. Results Two A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates harboring an H275Y substitution in the neuraminidase sequence were detected in patients with acute hematologic cancer. They had prolonged respiratory symptoms, with the virus present in the respiratory tract despite oseltamivir and peramivir treatment. Through the neuraminidase inhibition assay, both viruses were found to be resistant to oseltamivir and peramivir, but not to zanamivir. Although hemagglutinin and neuraminidase phylogenetic analyses suggested that the 2 A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates were not identical, their antigenicity was similar to that of the 2018-19 influenza vaccine virus. Conclusions Our data indicate the utility of monitoring influenza-infected immunocompromised patients in general hospitals for the early detection of emerging neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant viruses and maintaining continuous laboratory surveillance of patients with influenza-like illness in sentinel clinics to monitor the spread of such new variants. Finally, characterization of the virus can inform the risk assessment for future epidemics and pandemics caused by drug-resistant influenza viruses.

TI  - Comparative performances of new and existing indices of crown asymmetry: an evaluation using tall trees of<i>Eucalyptus pilularis</i>(Smith)
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past 50 years, crown asymmetry of forest trees has been evaluated through several indices constructed from the perspective of projected crown shape or displacement but often on an ad hoc basis to address specific objectives related to tree growth and competition, stand dynamics, stem form, crown structure and treefall risks. Although sharing some similarities, these indices are largely incoherent and non-comparable as they differ not only in the scale but also in the direction of their values in indicating the degree of crown asymmetry. As the first attempt at devising normative measures of crown asymmetry, we adopted a relative scale between 0 for perfect symmetry and 1 for extreme asymmetry. Five existing crown asymmetry indices (CAIs) were brought onto this relative scale after necessary modifications. Eight new CAIs were adapted from measures of circularity for digital images in computer graphics, indices of income inequality in economics, and a bilateral symmetry indicator in plant leaf morphology. The performances of the 13 CAIs were compared over different numbers of measured crown radii for 30 projected crowns of matureEucalyptus pilularistrees through benchmarking statistics and rank order correlation analysis. For each CAI, the index value based on the full measurement of 36 evenly spaced radii of a projected crown was taken as the true value in the benchmarking process. The index (CAI(13)) adapted from the simple bilateral symmetry measure proved to be the least biased and most precise. Its performance was closely followed by that of three other CAIs. The minimum number of crown radii that is needed to provide at least an indicative measure of crown asymmetry is four. For more accurate and consistent measures, at least 6 or 8 crown radii are needed. The range of variability in crown morphology of the trees under investigation also needs to be taken into consideration. Although the CAIs are from projected crown radii, they can be readily extended to individual tree crown metrics that are now commonly extracted from LiDAR and other remotely sensed data. Adding a normative measure of crown asymmetry to individual tree crown metrics will facilitate the process of big data analytics and artificial intelligence in forestry wherever crown morphology is among the factors to be considered for decision making in forest management.

T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Reduction of surgeries in axillary has been proved feasible in breast cancer with negative and limited involved axillary lymph nodes. However, for women with a heavy axillary burden, the extent of dissection is still arguable. Patients and methods From a total of 7042 patients with breast cancer who underwent surgical treatments between 2008 and 2014, 692 (9.85%) patients with the axillary staging of N2-3M0 were classified into Level I-II dissection group and Level I-III dissection group. 203 pairs of patients were matched by the propensity score. Results The positive rate of level-III lymph nodes is 62.4% in patients who underwent Level I-III dissection. There are 67 (22.1%) patients who experienced rise in staging from N2 to N3 due to level-III dissection. With a median follow-up of 62.4 months, no significant difference was observed in RFS (P = 0.897), MFS (P = 0.610) and OS (P = 0.755) between level I-II group and level I-III group. The same results were observed in the independent analysis of neoadjuvant and non-neoadjuvant subgroups. The binary regression model showed the positivity of level-III is only associated with involved lymph nodes in level-II. Conclusion Additional level-III dissection has a limited impact on survival but still valuable in an accurate stage. The reduction of surgeries in axillary should be treated with discretion in breast cancer patients with a heavy axillary burden.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The ecological environment of the Loess Plateau, China, is extremely fragile under the context of global warming. Over the past two decades, the vegetation of the Loess Plateau has undergone great changes. This paper aims to clarify the response mechanisms of vegetation to climate change, to provide support for the restoration and environmental treatment of vegetation on the Loess Plateau. Design/methodology/approach The Savitsky-Golay (S-G) filtering algorithm was used to reconstruct time series of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) 13A2 data. Combined with trend analysis and partial correlation analysis, the influence of climate change on the phenology and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) during the growing season was described. Findings The S-G filtering algorithm is suitable for EVI reconstruction of the Loess Plateau. The date of start of growing season was found to gradually later along the Southeast-Northwest direction, whereas the date of the end of the growing season showed the opposite pattern and the length of the growing season gradually shortened. Vegetation EVI values decreased gradually from Southeast to Northwest. Vegetation changed significantly and showed clear differentiation according to different topographic factors. Vegetation correlated positively with precipitation from April to July and with temperature from August to November. Originality/value This study provides technical support for ecological environmental assessment, restoration of regional vegetation coverage and environmental governance of the Loess Plateau over the past two decades. It also provides theoretical support for the prediction model of vegetation phenology changes based on remote sensing data.

TI  - Detecting and mapping drought severity using multi-temporal Landsat data in the uMsinga region of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has become a more frequent phenomenon under changing climatic conditions, particularly in Sub Saharan Africa. This study tested the utility of a newly proposed Temperature-Vegetation Water Stress Index (T-VWSI) in detecting drought severity using Landsat data for the years 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2018. This index was created using both NDVI and LST to detect drought severity within the region. The results show that the year 2016 experienced the most severe levels of drought, with the northern areas of the uMsinga region being most severely affected. SPI was used to corroborate the findings of the T-VWSI index and also established that the year 2016 was the year of severe drought in uMsinga. The results of this study have illustrated the potential of the T-VWSI index in effectively mapping and detecting drought over large spatial areas.

TI  - Mapping spatio-temporal variations in water hyacinth (<i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>) coverage on Rwandan water bodies using multispectral imageries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal knowledge on spread of invasive aquatic plants helps to determine their extent, abundance, and propagation rates in invaded water systems. Water hyacinthEichhornia crassipes(Liliales: Pontederiaceae) appeared in Rwandan water bodies in 1957, and it was legislated and accepted as a problematic invasive species in Rwanda in 1999. Water hyacinth has led to a reduction in water quantity and threatened the livelihood of local communities that live off fishing. To comprehend the status of the water hyacinth invasion and assist management strategies, it is important to have detailed and consistent information on its spatio-temporal spread, magnitude, and rate of change dynamics in water systems. This was investigated using time series Landsat satellite images for the years 1989, 2002, and 2017. Image classifications using the nonparametric classifier random forest as well as change detection analysis were carried out to process the satellite data. The results revealed a fluctuation in the extent of water hyacinth over the time series of 1989, 2002, and 2017 with estimated percentage cover of 17.7%, 22.4%, and 20.8%, respectively. An annual increase of 1.9% in water hyacinth invasion was observed from 1989 to 2002; while, a decline of 1.7% per annum was observed from 2002 to 2017. The decline observed in 2017 could be due to manual control undertaken by the government since 2002. This study confirms the potential of using remotely sensed imagery as a valuable method for determining the change in the extent and distribution of invasive alien weeds over time.

TI  - A comparison of passive surveillance and active cluster-based surveillance for dengue fever in southern coastal Ecuador
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Dengue is a major emerging infectious disease, endemic throughout the tropics and subtropics, with approximately 2.5 billion people at risk globally. Active (AS) and passive surveillance (PS), when combined, can improve our understanding of dengue's complex disease dynamics to guide effective, targeted public health interventions. The objective of this study was to compare findings from the Ministry of Health (MoH) PS to a prospective AS arbovirus research study in Machala, Ecuador in 2014 and 2015. Methods Dengue cases in the PS system were compared to laboratory confirmed acute dengue illness cases that entered the AS study during the study period. Variables of interest included age class and sex. Outbreak detection curves by epidemiologic week, overall cumulative incidence and age-specific incidence proportions were calculated. Descriptive statistics were tabulated for all variables of interest. Chi-square tests were performed to compare demographic characteristics between the AS and PS data sets in 2014 and 2015. Results 177 and 245 cases were identified from 1/1/2014 to 12/31/2015 by PS and AS, respectively; nine cases appeared in both systems. AS identified a greater number of laboratory-confirmed cases in 2014, accounting for more than 60% of dengue cases in the study area. In 2015, the opposite trend was observed with PS identifying 60% of the dengue cases in the study area. Peak transmission time in laboratory confirmed dengue illness, as noted by AS and PS was similar in 2014, whereas earlier detection (7 weeks) was observed by AS in 2015. Younger patients were more frequently identified by PS, while older patients were identified more frequently by AS. The cumulative incidence proportion for laboratory confirmed dengue illness reported via PS to the MoH was 4.12 cases per 10,000 residents in 2014, and 2.21 cases per 10,000 residents in 2015. Conclusions Each surveillance system captured distinct demographic subgroups within the Machala population, possibly due to differences in healthcare seeking behaviors, access to care, emerging threats of other viruses transmitted by the same mosquito vector and/or differences in clinical presentation. Integrating AS with pre-existing PS can aid in identifying additional cases in previously underdiagnosed subpopulations, improving our understanding of disease dynamics, and facilitating the implementation of timely public health interventions.

TI  - The Political Dimensions of Illegal Wolf Hunting: Anti-Elitism, Lack of Trust in Institutions and Acceptance of Illegal Wolf Killing among Norwegian Hunters
T2  - SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Qualitative studies have indicated that the illegal killing of wolves is often attributed a protest dimension. However, we have limited knowledge about the factors that impact this judgement. The present study investigates views on illegal wolf killing among Norwegian hunters and connects these views to background factors, hunting cultures, anti-elitism and the legitimacy of environmental institutions, probing the existence of a 'counterpublic' where killing wolves is seen as justified resistance. Only a minority tolerated the activity, but compared to other hunting-related offences, killing a wolf illegally was seen as 'not serious' by the largest group. Hunters with limited education, living in rural areas, and who were motivated by a 'tradition and stewardship' ethos when hunting, were more inclined to accept illegal killing. Anti-elitism and lack of trust in environmental institutions were even stronger predictors. We conclude that hunting-related issues are not among the prime drivers of support for illegal wolf hunting. Rather, it is typically part of a worldview that reflects a rural subaltern experience, comprising elements of cultural resistance. While the political dimension is not always articulated, overlooking it and treating illegal killing simply as 'crime' may stoke conflicts and fortify an understanding of power relations that already drives resistance.

TI  - A demonstration project of Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases: Prediction of interactions between air pollution and allergen exposure-the Mobile Airways Sentinel NetworK-Impact of air POLLution on Asthma and Rhinitis approach
T2  - CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - This review analyzes the state and recent progress in the field of information support for pollen allergy sufferers. For decades, information available for the patients and allergologists consisted of pollen counts, which are vital but insufficient. New technology paves the way to substantial increase in amount and diversity of the data. This paper reviews old and newly suggested methods to predict pollen and air pollutant concentrations in the air and proposes an allergy risk concept, which combines the pollen and pollution information and transforms it into a qualitative risk index. This new index is available in an app (Mobile Airways Sentinel NetworK-air) that was developed in the frame of the European Union grant Impact of Air POLLution on sleep, Asthma and Rhinitis (a project of European Institute of Innovation and Technology-Health). On-going transformation of the pollen allergy information support is based on new technological solutions for pollen and air quality monitoring and predictions. The new information-technology and artificial-intelligence-based solutions help to convert this information into easy-to-use services for both medical practitioners and allergy sufferers.

TI  - Multi-branch convolutional neural network for built-up area extraction from remote sensing image
T2  - NEUROCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Built-up area is one of the most important objects of remote sensing images analysis, therefore extracting built-up area from remote sensing image automatically has attracted wide attention. It is common to treat built-up area extraction as image segmentation task. However, it's hard to devise a handcrafted feature to describe built-up area since it contains many non-built-up elements, such as trees, grasslands, and small ponds. Besides, built-up area corresponds to large size local region without precise boundary in remote sensing image so that the precision of segmentation in pixel level is not reliable. To cope with the problem of built-up area extraction, a segmentation framework based on deep feature learning and graph model is proposed. The segmentation procedure comprises of three steps. Firstly, the image is divided into small patches whose deep features are extracted by the devised lightweight multi-branch convolutional neural network (LMB-CNN). Secondly, a patch-wise graph model is constructed according to the learnt features, and then is optimized to segment built-up area with patch-level precision in full frame of remote sensing image. At last, post-processing step is also adopted to make the segmentation result visually intact. The experiments verify that the proposed method shows excellent performance by achieving high overall accuracy over 98.6% on Gaofen-2 remote sensing image data with size of 10,240 x10,240.

TI  - Genetic profile of naive untreated primary cutaneous melanomas with a negative sentinel lymph node
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is typically offered to patients with primary cutaneous melanomas (PCMs) of >= 1 mm depth, but not all SLNs are positive using this cutoff. To ascertain whether positivity is genetically regulated, genetic analysis was performed using an augmented enrichment-based next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing assay in SLN-negative (Group 1, n = 8, mean depth 1.3 mm) and SLN-positive PCMs (controls, Group 2, n = 4, mean depth 1.4 mm). In Group 1, the mean number of mutations was 21 (range 3-48) with the most frequent mutations occurring in NF1 (75%) followed by TP53 (63%), CDKN2A and BRAF (38%), and NRAS (25%), while in Group 2, the ean number of mutations was 9.5 (range 5-18) with mutations in NRAS and BRAF being the most frequent (50%) followed by those in ATM, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and NOTCH1 (25%). Increased frequency of NF1-inactivating mutations in Group 1 provides provocative early data that the presence of NF1 mutations might confer a less aggressive phenotype.

TI  - Impact of Religious Commandments on Residential Architecture of Zoroastrians, Case Study: Dasturan District in Yazd City
T2  - IRAN-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH INSTITUTE OF PERSIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholars that have focused on cities as the subject of their research, account the worldview and religion as the most significant factors in formation of urban spaces and architectural compositions. This is indeed why historical cities are known to reflect beliefs and cultures of their constructors. The influence of Islam on Iranian ancient cities is studied considerably, though research on the influence of commandments of the Zoroastrian religion on their architectural spaces is at its infancy. Therefore, this research investigates the impact of religious commandments on Zoroastrian's residential architecture, based on the data obtained from fieldwork in the Dasturan district of the City of Yazd (Iran). To this end, besides identifying influential Zoroastrian commandments, the extent of, and the circumstances surrounding formation of such architectural spaces has been evaluated. In the conformity of theoretical findings of the research against the field data, it has been revealed that the Zoroastrian commandments have significantly influenced the formation of spaces of historical houses in Yazd (Dasturan district); particularly that practice of commandments "respect of sanctity of the four elements or Chahar-Akhshij (earth, water, air, fire)" and "faith in cosmos order (As.a/Rta)" have been emphasized in Zoroastrian residential architecture.

TI  - Individual tree crown detection and delineation across a woodland using leaf-on and leaf-off imagery from a UAV consumer-grade camera
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extraction of information about individual trees using remotely sensed data is essential to supporting ecological and commercial applications in forest environments. Data acquired by consumer-grade cameras onboard unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) offer an affordable option of high-spatial resolution imagery that can be used to extract forest structural information at a tree level. The aim of this work is to investigate the potential and accuracy of UAV time-series data to automatically detect and delineate tree crowns across an entire woodland. The workflow (presented in a step-by-step manner) involves the construction of a canopy height model (CHM) based on digital elevation models derived from the UAV photogrammetric point clouds. A watershed-based approach is modified to automatically detect and delineate the tree crowns, based on the CHM and the brightness information from the UAV orthomosaics. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated by comparing its results against manually delineated tree crowns. The results show an overall accuracy of 63%, where conifer species were more accurately delineated (up to 80%), while broadleaf species returned lower accuracies (<50 % ). Continued research is necessary to improve the confidence of automated individual tree crown detection and delineation, especially over complex forest structures.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Atewa Range Forest Reserve (ARFR) in Ghanais threatened by anthropogenic activities. This study used geospatial techniques to assess the effects of human activities on land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics in ARFR using Landsat satellite images of 1986, 1991, 2006 and 2016. Estimated Normalized Differential Vegetation Index showed a continuous decline in LULC, signifying increasing stress on vegetation in ARFR. Between 1986 and 2016, the rainforest reduced from 345.83km(2) to 183.48km(2); logged land declined from 324.52km(2) to 186.21km(2); farmland increased from 328.43km(2) to 384.68km(2); and settlement expanded from 110.48km(2) to 354.91km(2), respectively.

TI  - Local-scale agricultural drought monitoring with satellite-based multi-sensor time-series
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, drought constitutes a serious threat to food and water security. The complexity and multivariate nature of drought challenges its assessment, especially at local scales. The study aimed to assess spatiotemporal patterns of crop condition and drought impact at the spatial scale of field management units with a combined use of time-series from optical (Landsat, MODIS, Sentinel-2) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) (Sentinel 1) data. Several indicators were derived such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), Tasseled cap indices and Sentinel-1 based backscattering intensity and relative surface moisture. We used logistic regression to evaluate the drought-induced variability of remotely sensed parameters estimated for different phases of crop growth. The parameters with the highest prediction rate were further used to estimate thresholds for drought/non-drought classification. The models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and validated with in-situ data. The results revealed that not all remotely sensed variables respond in the same manner to drought conditions. Growing season maximum NDVI and NDMI (70-75%) and SAR derived metrics (60%) reflect specifically the impact of agricultural drought. These metrics also depict stress affected areas with a larger spatial extent. LST was a useful indicator of crop condition especially for maize and sunflower with prediction rates of 86% and 71%, respectively. The developed approach can be further used to assess crop condition and to support decision-making in areas which are more susceptible and vulnerable to drought.

AB  - The rate of positive margins in head and neck cancers has remained stagnant over the past three decades and is consistently associated with poor overall survival. This suggests that significant improvements must be made intraoperatively to ensure negative margins. We discuss the important role of fluorescence imaging to guide surgical oncology in head and neck cancer.

TI  - Quantifying spatial-temporal changes of aboveground carbon stocks using Landsat time series data: A case study of Miombo woodlands
T2  - International Journal of Environmental Studies
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a need for accurate reporting of the second-growth forest in accounting for the contribution of secondary forests to achieving global carbon sequestration strategies. This study develops a model relating aboveground live biomass (AGLB) to Landsat reflectance measurements, and this method is used on multi spatial-temporal Landsat data (1998, 2001, 2004, 2011 and 2016) to assess changes in Miombo woodlands in Zambia. Results showed that the enhanced vegetation index was a better predictor of AGLB (r(2) = 0.96; RMSE = 0.24 t ha(-1)) than the other assessed vegetation indices. Forest carbon stocks increased by an average rate of 3.65 +/- standard error (SE): 0.56 t ha(-1) yr(-1) from 1998 to 2001, but a continual decline was evident for the periods 2001-2004 (-0.60 t ha(-1) yr(-1)), 2004-2011 (-0.88 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) and 2011-2016 (-2.03 t ha(-1) yr(-1)). The study provides an empirical model for evaluating carbon stock changes.

TI  - Optimal MODIS data processing for accurate multi-year paddy rice area mapping in China
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Researchers, policy makers, and farmers currently rely on remote sensing technology to monitor crops. Although data processing methods can be different among different remote sensing methods, little work has been done on studying these differences. In order for potential users to have confidence in remote sensing products, an analysis of mapping accuracies and their associated uncertainties with different data processing methods is required. This study used the MOD09A1 and MYD09A1 products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite, from which the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the two-band EVI (EVI2) images were obtained. The objective of this study was to analyze the accuracy of different data processing combinations for multi-year rice area mapping. Sixteen combinations of EVI and EVI2 with two cloudy pixel removal methods (QA/BLUE) and four pixel replacement methods (MO/MY/MOY/MYO) were investigated over the Jiangsu Province of southeast China from 2006 to 2016. Different accuracy results were obtained with different data processing combinations for multi-year rice field mapping. Based on a comparison of the relative performance of different MODIS products and processing method combinations, EVI2_BLUE_MYO was proposed to be the optimal processing method, and was applied to forecasting the rice-planted area of 2017. Study results from 2006 to 2017 were validated against reference data and showed accuracies of rice area extraction of greater than 95%. The mean absolute error of transplanting, heading, and maturity dates were 11.55, 8.10, and 7.78 days, respectively. In 2017, two sample regions (A and B) were selected from places where rice fractional cover was greater than 75%. Rice area extraction accuracies of 85.0% (A) and 92.3% (B) were obtained. These results demonstrated the complementarity of MOD09A1 and MYD09A1 datasets in enhancing pixel spatial coverage and improving rice area mapping when atmospheric influences are significant. The optimal data processing combination indentified in this study is promising for accurate multi-year and large-area paddy rice information extraction and forecasting.

TI  - In-flight calibration results of the TROPOMI payload on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - After the launch of the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite on 13 October 2017, its single payload, the TROPO-spheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), was commissioned for 6 months. In this time the instrument was tested and calibrated extensively. During this phase the geolocation calibration was validated using a dedicated measurement zoom mode. With the help of spacecraft manoeuvres the solar angle dependence of the irradiance radiometry was calibrated for both internal diffusers. This improved the results that were obtained on the ground significantly. Furthermore the orbital and long-term stability was tested for electronic gains, offsets, non-linearity, the dark current and the output of the internal light sources. The CCD output gain of the UV, UVIS and NIR detectors shows drifts over time which can be corrected in the Level 1b (L1b) processor. In-flight measurements also revealed inconsistencies in the radiometric calibration and degradation of the UV spectrometer. Degradation was also detected for the internal solar diffusers. Since the start of the nominal operations (E2) phase in orbit 2818 on 30 April 2018, regularly scheduled calibration measurements on the eclipse side of the orbit are used for monitoring and updates to calibration key data. This article reports on the main results of the commissioning phase, the in-flight calibration and the instrument's stability since launch. Insights from commissioning and in-flight monitoring have led to updates to the L1b processor and its calibration key data. The updated processor is planned to be used for nominal processing from late 2020 on.

TI  - The Parenting Experiences of Hispanic Adolescent Fathers: A Life Course Theory Perspective
T2  - WESTERN JOURNAL OF NURSING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a life course theory perspective, this qualitative descriptive study explored how Hispanic adolescent fathers view fatherhood, and how their perception of parenthood is shaped by critical life events. Hispanics are one of the largest ethnic groups, as well as one of the populations that is overrepresented in adolescent births in the United States. Despite this, Hispanic adolescent fathers are understudied and underrepresented in research. Participants were recruited from a community-based fatherhood program. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Hispanic fathers, ages 16 years to 23 years. Participants conveyed their grief over fragmented family relationships and limited interactions with their own father. Some lived in hostile environments where they frequently experienced racism, discrimination, and neighborhood violence. The cumulative impact of these events resulted in substance use and emotional distress. Becoming a father was a sentinel event that helped resolve negative perceptions about fatherhood. Fatherhood also motivated participants towards a more productive, meaningful life.

TI  - Mapping aboveground biomass and its prediction uncertainty using LiDAR and field data, accounting for tree-level allometric and LiDAR model errors
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The increasing availability of remotely sensed data has recently challenged the traditional way of performing forest inventories, and induced an interest in model-based inference. Like traditional design-based inference, model-based inference allows for regional estimates of totals and means, but in addition for wall-to-wall mapping of forest characteristics. Recently Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-based maps of forest attributes have been developed in many countries and been well received by users due to their accurate spatial representation of forest resources. However, the correspondence between such mapping and model-based inference is seldom appreciated. In this study we applied hierarchical model-based inference to produce aboveground biomass maps as well as maps of the corresponding prediction uncertainties with the same spatial resolution. Further, an estimator of mean biomass at regional level, and its uncertainty, was developed to demonstrate how mapping and regional level assessment can be combined within the framework of model-based inference. Results Through a new version of hierarchical model-based estimation, allowing models to be nonlinear, we accounted for uncertainties in both the individual tree-level biomass models and the models linking plot level biomass predictions with LiDAR metrics. In a 5005 km(2)large study area in south-central Sweden the predicted aboveground biomass at the level of 18 m x18 m map units was found to range between 9 and 447 Mg center dot ha(-1). The corresponding root mean square errors ranged between 10 and 162 Mg center dot ha(-1). For the entire study region, the mean aboveground biomass was 55 Mg center dot ha(-1)and the corresponding relative root mean square error 8%. At this level 75% of the mean square error was due to the uncertainty associated with tree-level models. Conclusions Through the proposed method it is possible to link mapping and estimation within the framework of model-based inference. Uncertainties in both tree-level biomass models and models linking plot level biomass with LiDAR data are accounted for, both for the uncertainty maps and the overall estimates. The development of hierarchical model-based inference to handle nonlinear models was an important prerequisite for the study.

TI  - Spatio-temporal clustering of active wildfire pixels over a 19-year period in a southern African savanna ecosystem of Zimbabwe
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of active wildfires is critical for supporting policies and legislation related to wildfire management. The study tested the extent to which active wildfires significantly cluster in both space and time from 2000 to 2019 using space-time scan statistics permutation model (STSSP) available in the SaTScan(TM)software at the 6 month and annual scales. The statistical significance of each identified cluster was assessed using Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, the study assessed whether the radiative power of active wildfires exhibited significant trends over time using Mann-Kendall test. Results show that, over the 19-year period, primary clusters of active wildfires commonly occurred in the northern, southern and western districts of Zimbabwe. Significant clustering of active wildfires was observed between July and December at the 6-month scale and between January and December at the annual scale. Although mixed results were obtained regarding trends in radiative power of active wildfires, an increasing trend was observed across most districts and at the national scale suggesting that wildfires are getting hotter and covering large spatial extents. The ability to detect clustering of active wildfires in space and time provides rangeland managers with an opportunity for optimal and targeted management of wildfires.

TI  - The use of hysteroscopy in endometrial cancer: old questions and novel challenges
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy with a relatively good overall prognosis. It traditionally has two subtypes: type 1 (endometrioid carcinoma) and type 2 (non-endometrioid carcinoma). The prognosis is excellent for stage I endometrioid cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of 96%. However, the prognosis is much worse for women with high-risk endometrial cancer. Effective preoperative staging is important in order to tailor treatment and achieve optimal long-term survival. The majority of asymptomatic polyps detected by ultrasound are treated surgically. Conventionally, dilatation and curettage was performed to obtain a histological diagnosis, but nowadays hysteroscopy with biopsy is starting to be considered as the gold standard. Hysteroscopic resection seems to reduce the risk of underdiagnosed (atypical endometrial hyperplasia) endometrial cancer. To avoid the spread of malignant cells, hysteroscopy should be performed with concern to keep intrauterine pressure low. In comparison with cervical injection, the hysteroscopic method has a better detection rate in the para-aortic area during sentinel lymph node mapping. In the assessment of cervical involvement, the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging is significantly higher than the accuracy of hysteroscopy. In fertility-sparing cases, hysteroscopic endometrium resection with progesterone therapy is an acceptable option.

TI  - The effect of summer drought on the predictability of local extinctions in a butterfly metapopulation
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological impacts of extreme climatic events on population dynamics and community composition are profound and predominantly negative. Using extensive data of an ecological model system, we tested whether predictions from ecological models remain robust when environmental conditions are outside the bounds of observation. We observed a 10-fold demographic decline of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) metapopulation on the Aland islands, Finland in the summer of 2018 and used climatic and satellite data to demonstrate that this year was an anomaly with low climatic water balance values and low vegetation productivity indices across Aland. Population growth rates were strongly associated with spatiotemporal variation in climatic water balance. Covariates shown previously to affect the extinction probability of local populations in this metapopulation were less informative when populations were exposed to severe drought during the summer months. Our results highlight the unpredictable responses of natural populations to extreme climatic events.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 surveillance for a non-human primate breeding research facility
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the ensuing COVID-19 pandemic prompted the need for a surveillance program to determine the viral status of the California National Primate Research Center non-human primate breeding colony, both for reasons of maintaining colony health and minimizing the risk of interference in COVID-19 and other research studies. Methods We collected biological samples from 10% of the rhesus macaque population for systematic testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus by RT-PCR and host antibody response by ELISA. Testing required the development and validation of new assays and an algorithm using in laboratory-developed and commercially available reagents and protocols. Results and Conclusions No SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antibody was detected in this study; therefore, we have proposed a modified testing algorithm for sentinel surveillance to monitor for any future transmissions. As additional reagents and controls become available, assay development and validation will continue, leading to the enhanced sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and efficiency of testing.

TI  - Influence of Sea Surface Temperature on Outbreak of<i>Ulva prolifera</i>in the Southern Yellow Sea, China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images and environmental satellite CCD images, the spatio-temporal distribution ofUlva proliferain the southern Yellow Sea during the period of 2011-2018 was extracted and combined with MODIS Level3 Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) product data and Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data to analyze their influences on the growth and outbreak ofUlva prolifera.The following conclusions were drawn: 1) comprehensive analysis ofUlva proliferadistribution during the eight-year period revealed that the coverage area ofUlva proliferatypically exhibited a gradually increasing trend. The coverage area ofUlva proliferareached a maximum of approximately 1714.21 km(2)during the eight-year period in late June 2015. The area affected byUlva proliferafluctuated. In mid-July 2014, the area affected byUlva proliferareached a maximum of approximately 39 020.63 km(2). 2) The average growth rate ofUlva proliferawas positive in May and June but negative in July. During the outbreak ofUlva prolifera, the SST in the southern Yellow Sea tended to increase each month. The SST anomaly and average growth rate ofUlva proliferawere positively correlated in May (R-2=0.62), but not significantly correlated in June or July. 3) The variation trends of PAR and SST were approximately the same, and the PAR during this time period maintained a range of 40-50 mol/(m(2)center dot d), providing sufficient illumination for the growth and outbreak ofUlva prolifera.In addition, the abundant nutrients and suitable temperature in the sea area near northern Jiangsu shoal resulted in a high growth rate ofUlva proliferain May. In summary, the outbreak ofUlva proliferawas closely related to the environmental factors including SST, nutrients, and PAR. Sufficient nutrients and suitable temperatures resulted in a fast growth rate ofUlva prolifera.However, under poor nutrient conditions, even more suitable temperatures were not sufficient to trigger an outbreak ofUlva prolifera.

TI  - Narrowing the Options: Power and Glory in the Late Modern Religious Imagination
T2  - REVIEW OF FAITH & INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the conditions of late modernity, when a secular worldview has diminished the plausibility of affirmations of a transcendent truth or reality governing human affairs, the world's major religious traditions have spawned religious subcultures driven by narrowly political theologies. The result has been a constriction of conceptions of divine glory and majesty; these aggressive fundamentalist and religious-nationalist movements idolize the near-absolute power of the secular modern state. This elimination of options within the religious community, including the option of separatism or withdrawal from worldly political calculations, robs the religious imagination of a vital pluralism and reduces "power" to ideology.

TI  - Abrupt increase in harvested forest area over Europe after 2015
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale satellite data are used to quantify forest harvest rates in 26 European countries, finding an increase in harvested forest area of 49% and an increase in biomass loss of 69% between 2011-2015 and 2016-2018.Forests provide a series of ecosystem services that are crucial to our society. In the European Union (EU), forests account for approximately 38% of the total land surface(1). These forests are important carbon sinks, and their conservation efforts are vital for the EU's vision of achieving climate neutrality by 2050(2). However, the increasing demand for forest services and products, driven by the bioeconomy, poses challenges for sustainable forest management. Here we use fine-scale satellite data to observe an increase in the harvested forest area (49 per cent) and an increase in biomass loss (69 per cent) over Europe for the period of 2016-2018 relative to 2011-2015, with large losses occurring on the Iberian Peninsula and in the Nordic and Baltic countries. Satellite imagery further reveals that the average patch size of harvested area increased by 34 per cent across Europe, with potential effects on biodiversity, soil erosion and water regulation. The increase in the rate of forest harvest is the result of the recent expansion of wood markets, as suggested by econometric indicators on forestry, wood-based bioenergy and international trade. If such a high rate of forest harvest continues, the post-2020 EU vision of forest-based climate mitigation may be hampered, and the additional carbon losses from forests would require extra emission reductions in other sectors in order to reach climate neutrality by 2050(3).

TI  - Bioinformatic Identification of a Breast-Specific Transcript Profile
T2  - PROTEOMICS CLINICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To identify a breast-specific transcript profile for the first time, and present an updated bioinformatics strategy for searching tissue-specific transcripts and predicting their significance in cancer. Experimental Design The RNA-seq data of 49 311 transcripts in 88 human tissues from the GTEx, the Illumina Body Map, and the RIKEN FANTOM5 project are integrated to screen breast-specific transcripts. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, TGCA, and Kaplan-Meier Plotter are used to examine their expression in cancer tissues and values for prognosis prediction. Results Only 96 transcripts in human genome are breast-specific for women. Among them, ankyrin repeat domain 30A (ANKRD30A) and long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 993 (LINC00993) are further analyzed. The two transcripts are also breast-specific in 33 types of common female cancer and are often dysregulated in breast cancer tissues. Their expression is higher in the luminal breast cancer while significantly downregulated in triple-negative breast cancer. Moreover, the high expression levels of ANKRD30A and LINC0993 in breast cancer tissues indicate a better prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Breast-specific transcripts in human genome are rare and poorly understood currently. The data indicate that these breast-specific biomarkers are promising candidates for screening early cancer, assessing treatment response, monitoring recurrence, identifying metastatic tumor origin, and serving as potential targets for immunotherapy.

TI  - Monitoring long-term shoreline dynamics and human activities in the Hangzhou Bay, China, combining daytime and nighttime EO data
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Shorelines are vulnerable to anthropogenic activities including urbanization, land reclamation and sediment loading. Shoreline changes may be a reflection of the degradation of coastal ecosystems because of human activities. Understanding the shoreline dynamics is, therefore, a topic of global concern. Earth observation data, such as multi-temporal satellite images, are an important resource for assessing changes in coastal ecosystems. In this research, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to monitor and map historical shoreline dynamics in the Hangzhou Bay in China where the Qiantang River flows into the East China Sea. Specifically, we aimed to capture and quantify both the spatial and temporal shoreline changes and to assess the link between anthropogenic activities and shoreline changes on the integrity of this coastal area. We implemented a Tasselled Cap analysis (TCA) on Landsat imagery from 1985 to 2018 in GEE to calculate the wetness coefficient. We then applied Otsu method for automatic image thresholding on the wetness coefficient to detect waterbodies and shoreline changes. Further, we adopted the nighttime light data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) from 1992 to 2013 as a proxy of human activities. The results show that in the hotspot areas, the shoreline has moved by more than 5 km in the last decades, accounting for approximately 900 km(2) of land accretion. Within this area, the human activity, indicated by the intensity of nighttime light, increased significantly. The results of this work reveal the influence of human activities on the shoreline dynamics and can support policies that promote the sustainable use and conservation of coastal environments. Our methodology can be transferred and applied to other coastal zones in various regions and scaled up to larger areas.

TI  - The digital Earth Observation Librarian: a data mining approach for large satellite images archives
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout the years, various Earth Observation (EO) satellites have generated huge amounts of data. The extraction of latent information in the data repositories is not a trivial task. New methodologies and tools, being capable of handling the size, complexity and variety of data, are required. Data scientists require support for the data manipulation, labeling and information extraction processes. This paper presents our Earth Observation Image Librarian (EOLib), a modular software framework which offers innovative image data mining capabilities for TerraSAR-X and EO image data, in general. The main goal of EOLib is to reduce the time needed to bring information to end-users from Payload Ground Segments (PGS). EOLib is composed of several modules which offer functionalities such as data ingestion, feature extraction from SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data, meta-data extraction, semantic definition of the image content through machine learning and data mining methods, advanced querying of the image archives based on content, meta-data and semantic categories, as well as 3-D visualization of the processed images. EOLib is operated by DLR's (German Aerospace Center's) Multi-Mission Payload Ground Segment of its Remote Sensing Data Center at Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.

TI  - Relationships Among SST Variability, Physical, and Biological Parameters in the Northeastern Indian Ocean
T2  - ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study modelled physical and biological changes in the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, and the exclusive economic zone around Sri Lanka by examining the relationships between sea surface temperature (SST) and a range of biological and physical variables allowing prediction of the changes in the variables studied with changing temperature. Datasets were extracted from satellite data from 2003 to 2015. Boosted regression trees (BRT) were used to model the data and identify their (non-linear) relationships. Within the study region and based on the BRT model, nitrate, latent heat flux, wind speed, and chlorophylla(chla) concentration in open water were found to have negative relationships with SST, while air temperature and ozone mass mixing ratio had positive relationships. Seasonal peak values of wind speed and chlaconcentrations occurred from June to August. Peak SST and air temperature values occurred from March to May, peak nitrate and latent heat values from September to November, and peak ozone mass mixing ratios from December to February. The highly correlated ranges of air temperature, nitrate concentration, open water latent energy flux, surface wind speed, chlaconcentration, and ozone mass mixing ratio for SST above 28 degrees C were 299-300.5 K, >0.2 mu mol L-1, 120-160 W m(-2), 4-8 m s(-1), 0.1-1 mg m(-3), and 4.5-5.5 x 10(-8), respectively.

TI  - Advanced remote sensing techniques in flash flood delineation in Tabuk City, Saudi Arabia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods have been the most frequent, extensive, and dangerous type of worldwide natural crisis. Mountainous, urbanized, and arid land areas like Tabuk region of Saudi Arabia are highly vulnerable to flooding due to heavy and sudden rainstorms that affected the people, infrastructures, and ecological and biophysical environment. Immediately following such a disaster event, advanced techniques are very essential to delineate and assess the damage resulted from successful rescue and relief operations. In this article, the European Space Agency (ESA) freely accessed images were conducted from the earth observation synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor, the images were successfully practiced to delineate the deadly flood crisis took place in Tabuk City in January 2019. The Sentinel Application Platform for Sentinel-1 Toolbox (S1TBX) is used to support the display and analysis of the large archive of products from the ESA SAR mission. Level-1 ground range detected with high resolution of 20 m x 22 m image at 2019/01/30 T15:39:44 acquired and processed. A backscatter value of - 22.39 dub is selected to separate water from everything else. Only region of interest mask pixels are considered for the histogram analysis. Accordingly, the maximum threshold error is set to 0.255. RGB map created a binary mask of flooded, and non-flooded pixels show that a significant part of the area was in danger. The findings of the current methodology quantify the flooded surface area by almost 9 km(2)covers mainly the agricultural practices and the urban areas of the city of Tabuk. This study recommends that the future master plan of the Tabuk area should consider similar flooding risks. Finally, most arid lands like Tabuk are covered by sand that has similar backscatter as flooded land conditions. Therefore, the influence of this backscatter in flood mapping works should be assessed and exclusion techniques must be included to increase accuracy.

TI  - SCHOLARS IN DISGUISE: THE CHENG-ZHU NEO-CONFUCIAN REAPPRAISAL OF THE MERCHANT CLASS IN LATE MING
T2  - MING STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The phenomenon of the rise of merchants in late imperial China has been well examined in many studies, in which Confucian literati are shown to have made various adaptations to the new social reality. Wang Yangming's (1472-1529) School of Mind-Heart in particular, incorporated this development into its philosophical worldview so that the Confucian sagehood was deemed to be within the reach of merchants. However, the opposing Cheng-Zhu School of Principle has hitherto escaped focused investigation. This paper seeks to fill the lacuna by studying the writings of a Cheng-Zhu partisan, Li Guangjin (1549-1623), whose generous reappraisal of the merchants extended to the female agents as well. His obsession with scholarly pedigree and his belief in the efficacy of the transformative power of Confucian culture indicated that he never perceived the merchants as true merchants, but as scholars in disguise. He was daring to criticize and rework the authoritative writings of Sima Qian on money-makers for his own evaluation of men and women in trade. But his patriarchal views and support of the state cult of chastity nonetheless underscored his identity as an orthodox Cheng-Zhu Confucian.

M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Following SARS-CoV-2 emergence in China, a specific surveillance was implemented in France. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences retrieved through this surveillance suggests that detected initial introductions, involving non-clade G viruses, did not seed local transmission. Nevertheless, identification of clade G variants subsequently circulating in the country, with the earliest from a patient who neither travelled to risk areas nor had contact with travellers, suggests that SARS- CoV-2 might have been present before the first recorded local cases.

TI  - How Does Urban Spatial Structure Affect Economic Growth? Evidence from Landsat Data in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Employing Landsat data, quantitative indicators relating to urban spatial structure in China-including an urban compactness ratio and an urban elongation ratio-from 2007 to 2016 were selected and quantified. The panel data model indicated that urban compactness was negatively correlated with the urban GDP. Urban elongation was positively correlated with the urban GDP. But the urban elongation and the consumption of land resources cannot sustain urban economic growth in the long run. Therefore, to give full play to the economic benefits of spatial agglomeration and to curb the extensive elongation of urban spatial structure, there is an urgent need to reform the current urbanization mode and employ a market mechanism, changing the single government-regulated mode into a multi-subject cooperative mode.

TI  - David Stow: Christian educator in nineteenth century Scotland
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The educational work of David Stow evolved in three phases. He established a Sabbath school and helped to introduce both infant schooling and teacher training in Glasgow, Scotland in the nineteenth century. He helped to establish the Glasgow Normal Seminary and later he joined the Free Church of Scotland Normal Seminary. Stow was a committed Presbyterian Christian, and this motivated him and was at the centre of all of the three phases of his educational work. He was dedicated to the school education of the poor, similar to other educators of his time. He understood this mission to the poor as a means to rescue them from the corrupting influences in their urban settings. The corrupting influences would be replaced, however, by social control and the promotion of Christianity. This article presents an examination of the close links between his strongly held Christian beliefs, Christian worldview and his vision of schooling and teacher preparation.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing and GIS in Performance Evaluation of Irrigation Project at Disaggregated Level
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance evaluation of surface irrigation projects has been hitherto done at regional or project level due to the non-availability of a detailed spatial database of irrigation projects. Recent advancements in the capabilities of remote sensing techniques and Geographical Information System (GIS) have opened avenues of field level mapping and database creation for irrigation projects. In view of this, the application of remote sensing and GIS in command area mapping and detailed performance evaluation at the sub-project level (division level) was attempted, in the present study. The command area of Upper Wardha irrigation project in Amravati district of Maharashtra, India was mapped for irrigation infrastructures (canals, hydraulic structures, etc.), crop acreage, and other infrastructures (viz. road, railway, settlement, etc.) using high resolution Cartosat-1, IRS P6 LISS-IV data, and temporal IRS P6 LISS-III data. The performance of the irrigation project was evaluated using eight comparative indicators classified under three groups, namely agricultural performance, water-use performance, and physical performance. Remote sensing data along with field observed data were used to derive inputs for these performance indicators. The results indicate that the project has a positive impact on agriculture and economic growth of the region; however, water has been excessively used in some parts of the command area while supply has been inadequate in the tail region of the command. The water supply in the command area was reliable, however, not equally distributed among all the distributaries. The overall performance of the irrigation project was evaluated, and the divisions, which need immediate attention to improve the efficiency, were identified in this study.

TI  - Multispectral to Panchromatic Image Fusion Based on Morphological Extended-Half-Gradient
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening refers to the fusion of remotely sensed multispectral and panchromatic images which are characterized by different levels of spectral-spatial resolutions and acquired for the same location by optical remote sensing satellite sensors. In this paper, we propose a pansharpening algorithm based on morphological extended-half-gradient. Popular quality metrics employing two assessment methods, namely reduced resolution assessment and full resolution assessment, are used for performance measurement. For validating the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we compare its performance with that of morphological half-gradient-based fusion procedure and a few other popular image fusion algorithms. We also propose the best possible bias factor in the formulation of the proposed algorithm by experimentation on varied values. Three real datasets acquired by WorldView-4, SPOT-6 and QuickBird-2 are used in the experimentation. The results affirm that the proposed algorithm offers improved image fusion than using the morphological half-gradient. This successful demonstration of the proposed algorithm proves the potential of morphological image processing operations to be useful in the achievement of efficient pansharpening. This work also underlines the need for more computational efficiency in image fusion.

TI  - Recent influenza activity in tropical Puerto Rico has become synchronized with mainland US
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We used data from the Sentinel Enhanced Dengue Surveillance System (SEDSS) to describe influenza trends in southern Puerto Rico during 2012-2018 and compare them to trends in the United States. Methods Patients with fever onset <= 7 days presenting were enrolled. Nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza A and B viruses by PCR. Virologic data were obtained from the US World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Laboratories System and the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). We compared influenza A and B infections identified from SEDSS and WHO/NREVSS laboratories reported by US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) region using time series decomposition methods, and analysed coherence of climate and influenza trends by region. Results Among 23,124 participants, 9% were positive for influenza A and 5% for influenza B. Influenza A and B viruses were identified year-round, with no clear seasonal patterns from 2012 to 2015 and peaks in December-January in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons. Influenza seasons in HHS regions were relatively synchronized in recent years with the seasons in Puerto Rico. We observed high coherence between absolute humidity and influenza A and B virus in HHS regions. In Puerto Rico, coherence was much lower in the early years but increased to similar levels to HHS regions by 2017-2018. Conclusions Influenza seasons in Puerto Rico have recently become synchronized with seasons in US HHS regions. Current US recommendations are for everyone 6 months and older to receive influenza vaccination by the end of October seem appropriate for Puerto Rico.

TI  - Investigating the origin and pathways of atmospheric rivers in the world
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play an important role in the water cycle and destructive phenomena such as floods and storms. Thus, here the origin, structure, and pathway of ARs in the world were investigated considering the importance of the issue. To this end, the daily wind vector and jet stream data of the ERA-Interim were obtained with 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees spatial resolution for 1995-2019. Satellite images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GEOS) Water Vapor were used to examine the amount of precipitation caused by ARs. Also, graphical images were produced to study the origin, pathway, and expansion of ARs. The results indicated that jet streams play a major role in the genesis, direction, and pathway of ARs. Also, high-pressure (low-pressure) centers have a substantial role in the expansion (destination) of ARs. Regions such as west of the USA, west of southern headland of South America, northwest of Europe, the path of northeast Saudi Arabia to northeast Iran, Australia, and the distance between Japan and the east coast of Russia were the most affected regions of precipitation due to ARs. According to the results, there were seven major sources of ARs in the world, of which the most important one was located in southeast Asia. Regarding monthly distribution, January, September, and October had the highest occurrence of ARs. There was a minor difference in the number of ARs in two hemispheres. Only in the southern hemisphere did the ARs have a longer longitude. Investigating the number of occurrences of ARs indicated that in the highest state, three to four ARs were observed in the world simultaneously. Also, more than 90% of the ARs moved through the oceans.

TI  - Identification of landslide-prone slopes at Paglajhora area, Darjeeling Himalaya, India
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Paglajhora area, located in the southeastern part of the Kurseong town in the Darjeeling Himalaya region, India, experiences frequent slope failure especially in monsoon season. Due to the intricate disposition of major thrust zones (MCT, MBT, etc.), heavy rainfall, neotectonic and anthropogenic activities, etc., the cause of slope failure is not similar all over the area, which makes difficult to categorize the landslides based on their mode of failure. The present work is aimed to demarcate the landslide-prone areas from the surface displacement (horizontal) map derived by optical image correlation (OIC) technique applying normalized cross-correlation (NCC) algorithm of two temporal Landsat 8 OLI (level 1TP) images, supported by the ground field survey. Results indicate that the overall range of surface displacement (horizontal) rate in the study area varies from 0.4 to 8 m/year out of which the range 0.5-1.5 m/year being dominant classifying the slide type as slow-to-very slow earth flow with a velocity class varying from 3 to 2. Places showing relatively higher displacement values (3 to 8 m/year) match accurately with the already reported slide zones and the large exposed scarp surfaces noticed during the field surveys or distinguished from the satellite imagery. Areas with lower displacement rates (< 1.5 m/year) experience very slow earth flow, which are confirmed by the presence of cracks and steps on the major roads. Depths of shallow subsurface slip planes are established from dipole-dipole geo-electric surveys in few locations showing moderate surface velocity.

TI  - Assessing global Sentinel-2 coverage dynamics and data availability for operational Earth observation (EO) applications using the EO-Compass
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 scenes are increasingly being used in operational Earth observation (EO) applications at regional, continental and global scales, in near-real time applications, and with multi-temporal approaches. On a broader scale, they are therefore one of the most important facilitators of the Digital Earth. However, the data quality and availability are not spatially and temporally homogeneous due to effects related to cloudiness, the position on the Earth or the acquisition plan. The spatio-temporal inhomogeneity of the underlying data may therefore affect any big remote sensing analysis and is important to consider. This study presents an assessment of the metadata for all accessible Sentinel-2 Level-1C scenes acquired in 2017, enabling the spatio-temporal coverage and availability to be quantified, including scene availability and cloudiness. Spatial exploratory analysis of the global, multi-temporal metadata also reveals that higher acquisition frequencies do not necessarily yield more cloud-free scenes and exposes metadata quality issues, e.g. systematically incorrect cloud cover estimation in high, non-vegetated altitudes. The continuously updated datasets and analysis results are accessible as a Web application called EO-Compass. It contributes to a better understanding and selection of Sentinel-2 scenes, and improves the planning and interpretation of remote sensing analyses.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Turning Earth observation (EO) data consistently and systematically into valuable global information layers is an ongoing challenge for the EO community. Recently, the term 'big Earth data' emerged to describe massive EO datasets that confronts analysts and their traditional workflows with a range of challenges. We argue that the altered circumstances must be actively intercepted by an evolution of EO to revolutionise their application in various domains. The disruptive element is that analysts and end-users increasingly rely on Web-based workflows. In this contribution we study selected systems and portals, put them in the context of challenges and opportunities and highlight selected shortcomings and possible future developments that we consider relevant for the imminent uptake of big Earth data.

AB  - Environmental conditions influence human health and interact with other factors such as DNA, lifestyle, or the social environment. Earth observations from space provide data on the most diverse manifestations of these environmental conditions and make it possible to quantify them spatially. Using two examples - the availability of open and recreational space and the spatial distribution of air pollution - this article presents the potential of Earth observations for health studies. In addition, possible applications for health-related issues are discussed. To this end, we try to outline key points for an interdisciplinary approach that meets the conceptual, data technology, and ethical challenges.

TI  - The legacy of the Black Church: older African Americans' religiousness
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION SPIRITUALITY & AGING
M3  - Article
AB  - The pronounced ways religion manifests itself in African-American attitudes, beliefs, and behavior remains one of the most fascinating areas of social gerontology and the sociology of religion. Using Lincoln and Mamiya's discussion of the Black Church, we theorize that African Americans' worship and faith become full-bodied whether individuals are affiliated with black congregations or not. Embodiment of the 'black sacred cosmos' moves African Americans to a shared worldview that transcends immediate affiliation with a church. Older adults (N = 357) were interviewed in their homes. Most participants (N = 286) were selected from a random sample of the communitybased elders in a Northeastern city. "Snowball" sampling recruited 71 additional African American elders. Ages range from 60 to 101 with a mean of 74.1. African-Americans participating in black churches show only somewhat greater faith involvement than African-Americans in other churches when compared directly to one another. Regression analyses show religious involvement transcends African Americans' church affiliation. African Americans' worldview is a deeply rooted collective double-consciousness that can be inculcated and maintained outside black church congregations. Active affiliation with a black church seems to only slightly intensify the strength of older black people's worship practices and faith.

TI  - A prototype web-based analysis platform for drought monitoring and early warning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - It has long been recognized that an effective drought monitoring and early warning system, which provides functions for real-time condition monitoring and prediction, risk assessment, information dissemination and response recommendation, is very important for the preparedness for and mitigation of drought impacts. In this article, we review the currently existing drought monitor and early warning systems, discuss applicable remote sensing datasets and drought indicators and present the development of a web-based quasi-real-time Global Drought Monitoring & Analysis Platform (Web-GDMAP). The Web-GDMAP is built upon a series of indicators derived from multi-source satellite remote sensing data and various other sources of data. From a technical perspective, the Web-GDMAP system includes a series of components from data storage, model implementation and distribution, to client-side visualization and user intuitive interaction. From a theoretical perspective, the Web-GDMAP system integrates multi-indicators on different aspects of drought, including anomalies in precipitation, anomalies in land surface thermal and vegetation conditions, water deficit of soil and plants, etc. Several case studies on applying the developed Web-GDMAP in the Asian region are demonstrated. Further improvements and perspectives are discussed.

TI  - Sea-ice information and forecast needs for industry maritime stakeholders
T2  - POLAR GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Profound changes in Arctic sea-ice, a growing desire to utilize the Arctic's abundant natural resources, and the potential competitiveness of Arctic shipping routes, all provide for increased industry marine activity throughout the Arctic Ocean. This is anticipated to result in further challenges for maritime safety. Those operating in ice-infested waters require various types of information for sea-ice and iceberg hazards. Ice information requirements depend on regional needs and whether the stakeholder wants to avoid ice all together, operate near or in the Marginal Ice Zone, or areas within the ice pack. An insight into user needs demonstrates how multiple spatial and temporal resolutions for sea-ice information and forecasts are necessary to provide information to the marine operating community for safety, planning, and situational awareness. Although ship-operators depend on sea-ice information for tactical navigation, stakeholders working in route and capacity planning can benefit from climatological and long-range forecast information at lower spatial and temporal resolutions where the interest is focused on open-water season. The advent of the Polar Code has brought with it additional information requirements, and exposed gaps in capacity and knowledge. Thus, future satellite data sources should be at resolutions that support both tactical and planning activities.

TI  - Detection of sentinel lymph node in laparoscopic surgery for uterine cervical cancer using carbon nanoparticles
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) has been widely confirmed the efficiency in sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for various solid tumors. This study aims to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of CNPs during laparoscopic surgery for cervical cancer. Methods We analyzed 45 women with stage IB1-IIA1 cervical cancer who underwent SLN mapping using CNPs during laparoscopic surgery. The effectiveness of CNPs was evaluated by the detection rate and accuracy parameters. Factors associated with SLN laterality and SLNs localizations were analyzed. Results The overall and bilateral detection rate was 93.3% (42/45) and 60.0% (27/45), respectively. Elevated body mass index was associated with decreased bilateral detection rate (P = .015). A total of 225 SLNs were harvested, with a mean number of 5.0 +/- 3.6. A total of 81.3% of SLNs were in expected localizations including external iliac (39.1%), internal iliac (25.8%), and obturator (16.4%) regions, while 18.7% in unusual localizations including common iliac (10.7%), parametrial (7.6%), and presarcal (0.4%) regions. None positive lymph node was found in non-SLNs with a false-negative rate of 0%. Conclusion Laparoscopic SLN mapping with CNPs appears to be simple and efficient for patients with early-stage cervical cancer.

TI  - Combined use of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 to monitor water surface area dynamics using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting the water surface area and its temporal changes is essential in water resource management. Multispectral satellite data are applied extensively to monitor the surface water dynamics because of their repeated coverage. This letter monitors waterbody dynamics in a high temporal resolution from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images by using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Water index, automatic threshold and postprocessing of noise elimination are used to extract the water pixels from the background. Taking a part of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River () as a case study, the surface water dynamics are estimated by 47 dates from February 2017 to November 2019. The popular JRC Global Surface Water database includes 8 qualified monthly maps for the study area in 2017 and 2018, while our results display 32 maps covering 18 months. The surface water dynamic maps obtain an overall accuracy of 92.5% (using random sample points) and 82.0% (using manual-drawing thematic map). Also, water occurrence is calculated based on the water dynamics to indicate the permanent, seasonal and flooding areas. The high temporal dynamics of surface water are meaningful for the analysis of ephemeral lake and inundation extent.

TI  - Forest growing stock volume estimation using optical remote sensing over snow-covered ground: a case study for Sentinel-2 data and the Russian Southern Taiga region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes an approach to forest growing stock volume (GSV) estimation based on remotely sensed optical data in red and near-infrared (NIR) bands collected during the period of persistent snow cover. The approach was applied to Sentinel-2 reflectance measurements over forest with snow-covered understory in the north-eastern part of Russian Kostroma region. An in-house dataset with a forest stand-level GSV data was used to approximate GSV-reflectance relationship based on a power function for spruce-dominated, pine-dominated and birch-dominated forests. Highest coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.84 was obtained for spruce-dominated forest and red band. A cross-validation was performed to estimate the accuracy of a stand-level GSV estimation based on the obtained GSV-reflectance relationship model and Sentinel-2 data. Best results were achieved for pine-dominated forest and NIR band: R-2 = 0.66; root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 58 m(3)/ha. This GSV estimation approach was validated with an independent dataset of field survey-based GSV measurements at the sample plot level. Validation showed R-2 values comparable to cross-validation results but higher RMSE. Overall Sentinel-2 data tested was found to be informative for GSV estimation; however performance of the described approach varied significantly depending on forest type, spectral band, GSV values range and spatial aggregation level.

TI  - Dynamics of the Estuarine Turbidity Maximum Zone from Landsat-8 Data: The Case of the Maroni River Estuary, French Guiana
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) zone occurs in river estuaries due to the effects of tidal dynamics, density-driven residual circulation and deposition/erosion of fine sediments. Even though tropical river estuaries contribute proportionally more to the sediment supply of coastal areas, the ETM in them has been hardly studied. In this study, surface suspended particulate matter (SPM) determined from OLI (Operational Land Imager)-Landsat 8images was used to gain a better understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the ETM of the tropical Maroni estuary (located on the Guianas coast, South America). A method to estimate the remotely-sensed ETM location and its spatiotemporal evolution between 2013 and 2019 was developed. Each ETM was defined from an envelope of normalized SPM values > 0.6 calculated from images of the estuary. The results show the influence of the well-marked seasonal river discharge and of tides, especially during the dry season. The ETM is located in the middle estuary during low river-flow conditions, whereas it shifts towards the mouth during high river flow. Neap-spring tidal cycles result in a push of the ETM closer to the mouth under spring-tide conditions or even outside the mouth during the rainy season. An increase in SPM, especially since 2017, coincident with an extension of the ETM, is shown to reflect the periodic influence of mud banks originating from the mouth of the Amazon and migrating along the coast towards the Orinoco (Venezuela). These results demonstrate the advantages of ocean color data in an exploratory study of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the ETM of a tropical estuary, such as that of the Maroni.

M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We present 2 cases of penile cancer in which the inguinal lymph node was not palpable and inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) could be safely avoided by conducting dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (DSNB). The first case was in a 54-year-old man complaining of penile tumor for at least 3 months. We performed partial penectomy and DSNB. The pathological diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), pT2-3. There was no cancer metastasis in sentinel nodes (0/2). There has been no recurrence for 6 years after operation. The second case was 65-year-old man suffering from penile tumor for at least 6 months. We performed partial penectomy and DSNB. The pathological diagnosis was SCC,pT2. There was no cancer metastasis in sentinel nodes (0/3). There has been no recurrence for 1 year after operation. ILND has been recommended for intermediate and high-risk penile cancer even in patients with non-palpable inguinal lymph nodes. However,the complication of ILND is very high. DSNB has the potential to avoid ILND if there is no cancer metastasis in sentinel nodes.

TI  - Understanding the factors associated with long-term reconstructed turbidity in Lake Diefenbaker from Landsat-imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity affects a variety of aquatic ecosystem processes. Turbidity events are dominated by suspended sediment in many systems. High levels of suspended sediment in lakes can occur during periods of high inflows from turbid tributaries or suspension of sediment from lake beds. This study reconstructed historic turbidity levels using Landsat-imagery on Lake Diefenbaker (LD), a large river-reservoir constructed in the late 1960's on the naturally turbid South Saskatchewan River (SSR). We examined the factors that were associated with it. Reconstructed turbidity levels, from Landsat-images, were similar to actual turbidity. The SSR flow and wind speed explained 64%, 54% and 69% of the variability in estimated turbidity levels at the riverine zone, the transition zone and the entire reservoir, respectively. The decrease in estimated turbidity from June to October and down the length of the reservoir is likely associated with the decline in the SSR flow and the settling of suspended sediments. The relationship between estimated turbidity and wind speed may be associated with the resuspension of bottom sediment at the upper reach of LD. Wind speed and direction were related to estimated turbidity at the lacustrine zone (r(adj)(2) = 0.19, P < 0.05), which may be attributed to the persistence of sediments. We observed high turbidity in 2002 that exceeded other estimates of turbidity. Since 2002 was preceded by a prolonged drought, the high estimate turbidity may be related to an increase in sediment loads from the SSR flow and an increase in shoreline erosion from a rise in LD's water level. Hence, extreme events (drought and flooding) are associated with high turbidity in LD. As the Canadian Prairies continues to undergo climate change, lakes located in this region are predicted to experience more frequent extreme events. These extreme eventswill cause further deterioration of water quality. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper studies the relationship between land tenure for smallholder agriculture and deforestation. We combine high resolution satellite data on deforestation with rich household and commune-level, biannual panel data from Vietnam. We study two margins of tenure security, whether a household has any land title (extensive) and the share of a household's land held in title (intensive). Using a household-fixed effects model, we find the increases in crop production and land investment associated with holding land title are driven by the intensive margin. We then aggregate the survey data to the commune-level and find evidence that marginal increases in extensive tenure (share of households with any land title) increase deforestation holding constant the average intensive tenure (average share of land held in tenure among those with land title). We find some evidence that increasing the intensive margin of tenure (holding constant the extensive tenure) decreases deforestation. These results present a more nuanced view of the tenure-deforestation relationship than is prevalent in the existing literature.

TI  - Investigation of Aerosol Climatology, Optical Characteristics and Variability over Egypt Based on Satellite Observations and In-Situ Measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Egypt experiences high rates of air pollution, which is a major threat to human health and the eco-environment and therefore needs to be tackled by defining major causes to hinder or mitigate their impacts. The major driving forces of air pollution are either of local and/or regional origin. In addition, seasonal aerosols may be natural, such as dust particles transported from the western desert, or anthropogenic aerosols which are transported from industrial areas and smoke particles from seasonal biomass burning. Monitoring the optical properties of aerosols and their pattern in the atmosphere on a daily basis requires a robust source of information and professional analytical tools. This research explored the potential of using time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data to comprehensively investigate the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and variability for the period 2012-2018 on a daily basis. The data show that spring, summer and autumn seasons experienced the highest anomaly originating from regional and national sources. The high AOD in spring associated with a low angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE) indicates the presence of coarse particles which naturally originate from desert dust or sea spray. In contrast, the high AE in summer and autumn demonstrated the dominance of fine anthropogenic aerosols such as smoke particles from local biomass burning. The observation of a high number of fire incidents over Egypt in October and November 2018, during the months of rice crop harvesting, showed that these incidents contribute to the presence of autumn aerosols across the country. In-situ measurements of Particulate Matter (PM10) from local stations from an environmental based network as well as the AERONET AOD were used to validate the MODIS AOD, providing a high correlation coefficient of r = 0.73.

TI  - Bergapten modulates ovalbumin-induced asthma
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Prior studies on the anti-inflammatory compound bergapten have shown promise in averting allergic airway hyperresponsiveness. This study sought to establish its possible role in modulating an immunologically-induced airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in an ovalbumin model of asthma. Asthma is characterised by inflammation and constriction of the airway passages. Therapy is aimed at bronchodilation and reducing inflammation. Histamine is an inflammatory mediator and involved in immune reactions. It is released from mast cells which are important sentinel cells of the innate immune system involved in the inflammatory response. In the asthma model, ovalbumin solution (2 mg ovalbumin) was administered i.p. as a sensitisation dose on day 1 and on day 14 as a booster dose to sensitise the immune system. This was followed by a 10-day challenge on days 21 - 30 using aerosolised ovalbumin (1% w/v dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) at a cut-off latency of 10 min. Bergapten was administered at doses of 3 - 30 mg kg(-1) p.o. 1 h prior to each challenge. Times to pre-convulsive dyspnoea were recorded. Guinea-pigs were sacrificed and lungs harvested for histological and antioxidant studies. In determining the effect of bergapten on histamine, an isolated guinea pig ileum preparation by the administration of bergapten (1 - 10 mu g ml(-1)) in the presence of histamine. Bergapten increased times to pre-convulsive dyspnoea in the ovalbumin challenge and reduced pathological damage to bronchial tissue. The deposition of collagen around bronchioles was minimised. Antioxidant studies showed higher catalase and superoxide dismutase activity in groups treated with bergapten. Bergapten produced a rightward shift on the Schild plot analysis with a slope of 1.4 and a pA(2) value of 9.3 was obtained in the isolated tissue experiment which confirms that bergapten acts as an antagonist on histaminic H-1 receptors. Bergapten modulates inflammation in ovalbumin-induced asthma and antagonises histamine at the H-1 receptor. (C) 2020 The Authors.

T2  - REPORTS OF PRACTICAL ONCOLOGY AND RADIOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the method and present one center's experience in applying the SNOLL technique to patients with non-palpable suspicious breast lesions.Materials and methods: 371 patients with suspected malignant lesions or diagnosed non-palpable breast cancer were subjected to a preoperative SNOLL procedure. The day before the surgery, they were administered two radiotracers to localize the tumor in the breast and the sentinel node. The following day, with the help of a handheld gamma probe the breast conserving surgery was performed.Results: All 371 patients (100%) had their suspected occult breast lesions resected. Histo-pathological examination revealed cancer in 339 patients all these patients had their sentinel nodes examined. The intraoperative tests showed the sentinel node to be metastatic in 35 patients, who were then given a simultaneous axillary lymphadenectomy. Another 7 patients were diagnosed with positive lymph nodes in the final pathology and had to undergo a second operation. Reoperations compelled by positive surgical margins were performed in 26 cases.Conclusions: SNOLL as a good technique of intraoperative localization, enables to remove a nonpalpable breast cancer together with sentinel lymph node in a single surgical procedure. It seems to be a optional method to be used in patients treated with breast conserving therapy. (C) 2020 Greater Poland Cancer Centre. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Wetland Monitoring Using SAR Data: A Meta-Analysis and Comprehensive Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite providing vital ecosystem services, wetlands are increasingly threatened across the globe by both anthropogenic activities and natural processes. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has emerged as a promising tool for rapid and accurate monitoring of wetland extent and type. By acquiring information on the roughness and moisture content of the surface, SAR offers unique potential for wetland monitoring. However, there are still challenges in applying SAR for mapping complex wetland environments. The backscattering similarity of different wetland classes is one of the challenges. Choosing the appropriate SAR specifications (incidence angle, frequency and polarization), based on the wetland type, is also a subject of debate and should be investigated more thoroughly. The geometric distortion of SAR imagery and loss of coherency are other remaining challenges in applying SAR and its processing techniques for wetland studies. Hence, this study provides a systematic meta-analysis based on compilation and analysis of indexed research studies that used SAR for wetland monitoring. This meta-analysis reviewed 172 papers and documented an upward trend in usage of SAR data, increasing usage of multi-sensor data, increasing integration of C- and L- bands over other configurations and higher classification accuracy with multi-frequency and multi-polarized SAR data. The highest number of wetland research studies using SAR data came from the USA, Canada and China. This meta-analysis highlighted the current challenges and solutions for wetland monitoring using SAR sensors.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of land-use and land-cover changes in Kainji Lake National Park, Nigeria
T2  - FORESTIST
M3  - Article
AB  - There is paucity of information on the rates at which most protected areas in Nigeria are being depleted as population soars. In order to formulate realistic: management policies, reliable data on land use/land cover are indispensable.We evaluated the changes int the forest covers of Kainji Lake National Park (KLNP) using multi-temporal remote :sensing data. Landsat IM, EIM+, and OLVIC images of live age-series were analyzed using ArcGlS 10.5. A Normalized Difference Vegetation Index analysis was performed, and vegetation covers were distinguished. The rates of change were x-rayed and future projections made. rive land-use and land-cover classes (forest. savannah. swamp/water body, bare land, and built-up area) were distinguished. The results revealed that the area experienced considerable changes in vegetation covers. It was evident that from 1988 to 2018, the Borgu sector increased in forest and bare land by 10.728.18 ha (2.4%) and 19,540.83 ha (4.3%) at 0.08% and 0.14% per annum, respectively, whereas savannah and swamp/water body decreased by 27,134.28 ha (6.09) and 3,104.73 ha (01%) at annual rates of 0.2096 and 0.02%, respectively. In the Zugurma sector, forest and bare land increased by 7,247.21 ha (5.3%) and 44,341.74 ha (37.5%) al 0.18% and 1.08% per annum, respectively, whereas swamp decreased by 51,583.95 ha (37.8%) al 1.76% per annum. These changes were due to increases in anthropogenic activities in these parks, which negatively impacted the swamps and grassland. There were depletions along borders shared between the park and surrounding communities, and this poses degradation threats if not stemmed. A stricter protection measure is advocated. The park management must explore ixissible alter nat iVeti for area management.

TI  - Mega Regions and Pandemics
T2  - TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has put the relationship between spatial structure and disease exposure into relief. Here, we propose that mega regions - clusters of metropolitan regions like the Acela Corridor in the United States are more exposed to diseases earlier in pandemics. We review standard accounts for the benefits and costs of locating in such regions before arguing that pandemic risk is higher there on average. We test this mega region exposure theory with a study of the US urban system. Our results indicate that American mega regions have born the early brunt of the disease, and that three mega regions are hotspots. From this standpoint, the extent more than the intensity of New York's urbanization may be implicated in its COVID-19 experience. We conclude that early pandemic risk is a hitherto unrecognised diseconomy operating in mega regions.

TI  - Estimating Proportion of Vegetation Cover at the Vicinity of Archaeological Sites Using Sentinel-1 and-2 Data, Supplemented by Crowdsourced OpenStreetMap Geodata
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring vegetation cover is an essential parameter for assessing various natural and anthropogenic hazards that occur at the vicinity of archaeological sites and landscapes. In this study, we used free and open access to Copernicus Earth Observation datasets. In particular, the proportion of vegetation cover is estimated from the analysis of Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical images, upon their radiometric and geometric corrections. Here, the proportion of vegetation based on the Radar Vegetation Index and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is estimated. Due to the medium resolution of these datasets (10 m resolution), the crowdsourced OpenStreetMap service was used to identify fully and non-vegetated pixels. The case study is focused on the western part of Cyprus, whereas various open-air archaeological sites exist, such as the archaeological site of "Nea Paphos" and the "Tombs of the Kings". A cross-comparison of the results between the optical and the radar images is presented, as well as a comparison with ready products derived from the Sentinel Hub service such as the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Urban and Sentinel-2 Scene classification data. Moreover, the proportion of vegetation cover was evaluated with Google Earth red-green-blue free high-resolution optical images, indicating that a good correlation between the RVI and NDVI can be generated only over vegetated areas. The overall findings indicate that Sentinel-1 and -2 indices can provide a similar pattern only over vegetated areas, which can be further elaborated to estimate temporal changes using integrated optical and radar Sentinel data. This study can support future investigations related to hazard analysis based on the combined use of optical and radar sensors, especially in areas with high cloud-coverage.

TI  - Grossing Breast Cancer Specimens: A Comprehensive Review
T2  - AJSP-REVIEWS AND REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Grossing breast specimens presents a unique challenge in the anatomic pathology laboratory, because the approach varies with the type of specimen received, the preoperative diagnosis, and the administration of neoadjuvant therapy. Furthermore, careful attention to preanalytic variables, such as time of fixation, is required. The specimen often lacks orienting anatomic landmarks, and accurately documenting margins in 3 dimensions requires a deliberate approach that is easily understood for future reference. This article will provide a comprehensive source for grossing commonly received breast specimens, ranging from surgical biopsies to modified radical mastectomies and will describe the proper care of preanalytical measures to avoid compromise of biomarkers, methods to ensure adequate sampling of tissue for diagnosis, and assessment of tumor burden following neoadjuvant treatment.

TI  - Peri-urban pesticide contamination risk index
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The massive use of pesticides in the production of food and raw materials generates growing world concern due to the numerous evidences of their negative effects on health and the environment. In countries where detailed information of agricultural pesticide use near to urban areas is not available, it is necessary have a simple methodology that does not require data that are difficult to obtain in order to create an ecological indicator of the risk of pesticide contamination at the peri-urban level. The objective of this research is to generate a peri-urban pesticide contamination risk index using satellite information and accessible scientific pesticide data. The Peri-urban Pesticide Contamination Risk Index (PUPCRI) is composed of an indicator of the toxicity of the set of pesticides used in each crop, and two factors that quantify the surface occupied by agricultural activity and the tree surface in the urban periphery. The Environmental Risk Index has been used to calculate the toxicity of herbicides, insecticides and fungicides used in soybean, corn and wheat crops. Through the classification of Sentinel 2 satellite images, data was obtained of arable land, soybean, corn and wheat crops, and tree cover, in different peri-urban rings, with a maximum distance of two kilometers from the urban edge. The PUPCRI index was tested in 20 cities pertaining to the region with the highest agricultural productivity in Argentina. The results show that most of the cities have high to very high indices of exposure to pesticides, mainly due to the proximity of agricultural activity to the urban edge and the lack of tree cover. The PUPCRI index allows a quick and simple analysis of the potential risk of exposure to the use of crop pesticides in the urban periphery.

TI  - Crop proximity index for monitoring of peri-urban land use in agro-industrial crop regions
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The agro-industrial production of genetically modified organisms uses great amounts of pesticides, close to cities, which generates growing concern due to the numerous evidence of their negative effects on health and the environment. In a context of the lack, or inaccessibility, of official data on crop dynamics and pesticide use, environmental indicators using satellite data are needed for the proper monitoring of peri-urban areas. The objective of this research is to make a crop proximity index using satellite information to assess and monitor peri-urban agro-industrial activity. Twenty cities in Argentina and ten in the United States were selected. The CPI index is designed to evaluate a city and its peri-urban areas as a whole by taking account of the land uses and factors that can potentially influence the proximity to agro-industrial activity to the population living in those cities. Agriculture factor was weighted by proximity or remoteness using perimeter rings from the urban edge. All the necessary data for the calculation of the CPI index were obtained through the classification and processing of Sentinel 2 satellite images with software and the Google Earth Engine platform. The results show a worrying situation, 90% of cities in Argentina and 80% in the United States have a negative CPI. Most of the cities examined are extremely close to extensive areas of crops, that use a high amount of pesticides and which do not have the protection of trees or buffer zones.

T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGIE-RELIEF PROCESSUS ENVIRONNEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic and topographic factors control the distribution of forests across the globe. The present study investigated the impacts of these factors on spatial distribution of sub-tropical (scrub and pine) and moist temperate forests in Pakistan. The study used Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Sentinel-2 images and climatic data to quantify the impacts of climatic and topographic factors on distribution of forests. The data was statistically analyzed using correlation coefficient (R), liner regression and decision tree. Results specified six forest types during stratification. These types were significantly related to topographic (elevation) and climatic factors. Correlation coefficient (R) indicated strong positive relationship with elevation (R= 0.02) followed by annual mean temperature (R= 0.76). Similarly, annual precipitation indicated positive relation with R value of 0.53. Stepwise linear regression model showed that elevation, precipitation seasonality and annual temperature range were strongly significant with overall R-2 of 0.85. Decision trees were developed to explore passible interactions of predictors to determine imperative factors. Results of decision trees of both growing methods (Chi-squared Automatic interaction Detection (CHAID) and Classification and Regression Trees (CRT)) showed elevation was the most important factor that predicted particular forest type. Moreover, other factors such as temperature of the driest quarter, annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality and slope Were identified as important factors in CRT. The present study concluded that forest types were strongly influenced by climate and topography. However, elevation was the best predictor, has significant relative importance and can he used for detailed forest stratification.

TI  - Mapping soil profile depth, bulk density and carbon stock in Scotland using remote sensing and spatial covariates
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon is an important factor in land management decision making, climate change mitigation and landscape planning. In Scotland, where approximately one-quarter of the soils are peat, this information has usually been obtained using field survey and mapping, with digital soil mapping only carried out recently. Here a method is presented that integrates legacy survey data, recent monitoring work for peatland restoration surveys, spatial covariates such as topography and climate, and remote sensing data. The aim of this work was to provide estimates of the depth, bulk density and carbon concentration of Scotland's soils in order to allow more effective carbon stock mapping. A neural network model was used to integrate the existing data, and this was then used to generate a map of soil property estimates for carbon stock mapping at 100-m resolution over Scotland. Accuracy assessment indicated that the depth mapping to the bottom of the organic layer was achieved with anr(2)of .67, whereas carbon proportion and bulk density were estimated with anr(2)of .63 and .79, respectively. Modelling of these three properties allowed estimation of soil carbon in mineral and organic soils in Scotland to a depth of 1 m (3,498 megatons) and overall (3,688 megatons). HighlightsScotland's soil organic carbon was mapped using a digital soil mapping approach. This provides a high-resolution map available for scientists, regulatory bodies and policymakers. The method largely agreed with previous work but improved the spatial resolution of the mapping. Significant soil carbon stocks are held in both organic (peat) and non-peat soils.

TI  - Moral Order in Yoruba Worldview and the Impact of Belief in the Divinities
T2  - BLACK THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - For the Yoruba, God, the divinities and the community define morality whereas in Aquinas the order of morality is eternal law, natural law and positive laws. This order of morality fits into a Christian moral order, such that morality begins from God and all other levels of law follow without contradicting the eternal law. For the Yoruba, the moral order is different; there is the Eternal law, Natural law, Cultural law with provision for the divinities and Community laws. The implication of this moral order in Yoruba morality is that cultural laws sometimes take precedence over natural law, making it possible for divinities to prescribe laws over and above natural laws. This paper compares the moral order in Aquinas' morality and that of the Yoruba. This paper helps scholars situate the history and context of moral order in the worldview of the Yoruba in order to better appreciate the implications.

TI  - New Insights for Understanding the Structural Deformation Style of the Strike-Slip Regime along the Wadi Shueib and Amman-Hallabat Structures in Jordan Based on Remote Sensing Data Analysis
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents new findings that contribute to the understanding of the deformational style of the Wadi Shueib Structure (WSS) and the Amman-Halabat Structure (AHS) and their relationship with the regional tectonic regime of the Dead Sea Transform Fault (DSTF). Our research utilized Landsat-8 OLI imagery for the automatic extraction of lineaments, and our lineament mapping was facilitated by processing and digital image enhancement using principal component analysis (PCA). Our data revealed a relatively higher density of lineaments along the extension of the major faults of the WSS and AHS. However, a relatively lower density of lineaments was shown in areas covered by recent deposits. Two major lineament trends were observed (NNE-SSW and NW-SE) in addition to a minor one (NE-SW), and most of these lineaments are parallel to the orientation of the WSS and AHS. We offer the supposition that the DSTF has merged into the major faults of the WSS and AHS. We further suppose that these faults were reactivated as a restraining bend composed of active strike-slip fault branches that developed due to the NNW-SSE-trending Dead Sea transpressional stress field. Depending on the relationship between the direction of the WSF and AHF strands and the regional tectonic displacement along the DSTF, thrust components are present on faults with horsetail geometry, and these movements are accompanied by folding and uplifting. Thus, the major faults of the WSS and AHS represent a contractional horsetail geometry with associated folding and thrusting deformation.

TI  - A Soft Computing Approach for Selecting and Combining Spectral Bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce a soft computing approach for automatically selecting and combining indices from remote sensing multispectral images that can be used for classification tasks. The proposed approach is based on a Genetic-Programming (GP) framework, a technique successfully used in a wide variety of optimization problems. Through GP, it is possible to learn indices that maximize the separability of samples from two different classes. Once the indices specialized for all the pairs of classes are obtained, they are used in pixelwise classification tasks. We used the GP-based solution to evaluate complex classification problems, such as those that are related to the discrimination of vegetation types within and between tropical biomes. Using time series defined in terms of the learned spectral indices, we show that the GP framework leads to superior results than other indices that are used to discriminate and classify tropical biomes.

TI  - Change Detection from Remote Sensing to Guide OpenStreetMap Labeling
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing amount of openly available, meter-scale geospatial vertical aerial imagery and the need of the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project for continuous updates bring the opportunity to use the former to help with the latter, e.g., by leveraging the latest remote sensing data in combination with state-of-the-art computer vision methods to assist the OSM community in labeling work. This article reports our progress to utilize artificial neural networks (ANN) for change detection of OSM data to update the map. Furthermore, we aim at identifying geospatial regions where mappers need to focus on completing the global OSM dataset. Our approach is technically backed by the big geospatial data platform Physical Analytics Integrated Repository and Services (PAIRS). We employ supervised training of deep ANNs from vertical aerial imagery to segment scenes based on OSM map tiles to evaluate the technique quantitatively and qualitatively. Data Set License:ODbL

TI  - Temperature Profiles From Two Close Lidars and a Satellite to Infer the Structure of a Dominant Gravity Wave
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gravity waves (GW) are a crucial coupling mechanism for the exchange of energy and momentum flux (MF) between the lower, middle, and upper layers of the atmosphere. Among the remote instruments used to study them, there has been a continuous increment in the last years in the installation and use of lidars (light detection and ranging) all over the globe. Two of them, which are only night operating, are located in Rio Gallegos (-69.3 degrees W, -51.6 degrees S) and Rio Grande (-67.8 degrees W, -53.8 degrees S), in the neighborhood of the austral tip of South America. This is a well-known GW hot spot from late autumn to early spring. Neither the source for this intense activity nor the extent of its effects have been yet fully elucidated. In the last years, different methods that combine diverse retrieval techniques have been presented in order to describe the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of observed GW, their propagation direction, their energy, and the MF that they carry. Assuming the presence of a dominant GW in the covered region, we develop here a technique that uses the temperature profiles from two simultaneously working close lidars to infer the vertical wavelength, ground-based frequency, and horizontal wavelength along the direction joining both instruments. If in addition within the time and spatial frame of both lidars there is also a retrieval from a satellite like SABER (Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry), then we show that it is possible to infer also the second horizontal wavelength and therefore reproduce the full 3-D GW structure. Our method becomes verified with an example that includes tests that corroborate that both lidars and the satellite are sampling the same GW. The improvement of the Rio Gallegos lidar performance could lead in the future to the observation of a wealth of cases during the GW high season. Between 8 and 14 hr (depending on the month) of continuous nighttime data could be obtained in the stratosphere and mesosphere in simultaneous soundings from both ground-based lidars.

TI  - Volcanogenic talc-copper deposits of Darhib-Abu Jurdi area, Egypt: Petrogenesis and remote sensing characterization
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic talc deposits were developed as an integral part of a volcanogenic massive sulfide system in Darhib-Abu Jurdi bimodal-mafic type submarine volcanics in the South Eastern Desert of Egypt. These Pan-African metavolcanics were erupted in a rift-related environment and experienced low-grade greenschist metamorphism. They host talc-malachite mineralization, mainly within E-W trending alteration zones along the major latitudinal shear planes. These mineralized alteration zones contain economic talc deposits as well as averages of 1.7% Cu and 0.46% Zn; the maximum may exceed 11% Cu. Sentinel-2, ASTER, and Landsat-8 dataset in conjunction with a portable TerraSpec Halo mineral identifier device (ASD) were employed in detecting and mapping these mineralized alteration zones within the Darhib-Abu Jurdi metavolcanics. Petrography, mineralogy, and geochemistry of these deposits and host volcanics enabled to put constraints on their petrogenesis and evolution as a submarine hydrothermal vent system. Mineralogical characteristics of pervasive chloritization stringer zone, hypogene primary sulfide ore zone, and supergene oxidized zone are addressed and discussed. Talc deposits were formed at Darhib-Abu Jurdi area as the main gangue phase via (a) direct precipitation on seafloor by interaction of silica-saturated hydrothermal fluids with Mg-rich seawater, (b) precipitation with actinolite/tremolite at shallow depth beneath the sulfide ore lenses due to penetration of Mg-rich seawater into hydrothermal conduit, and (c) replacement of pre-existing tremolite, actinolite, chlorite, and septechlorite.

TI  - Detection of Very Small Tree Plantations and Tree-Level Characterization Using Open-Access Remote-Sensing Databases
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly fragmented land property hinders the planning and management of single species tree plantations. In such situations, acquiring information about the available resources is challenging. This study aims to propose a method to locate and characterize tree plantations in these cases. Galicia (Northwest of Spain) is an area where property is extremely divided into small parcels. European chestnut (Castanea sativa) plantations are an important source of income there; however, it is often difficult to obtain information about them due to their small size and scattered distribution. Therefore, we selected a Galician region with a high presence of chestnut plantations as a case study area in order to locate and characterize small plantations using open-access data. First, we detected the location of chestnut plantations applying a supervised classification for a combination of: Sentinel-2 images and the open-access low-density Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, obtained from the untapped open-access LiDAR Spanish national database. Three classification algorithms were used: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost. We later characterized the plots at the tree-level using the LiDAR point-cloud. We detected individual trees and obtained their height applying a local maxima algorithm to a point-cloud-derived Canopy Height Model (CHM). We also calculated the crown surface of each tree by applying a method based on two-dimensional (2D) tree shape reconstruction and canopy segmentation to a projection of the LiDAR point cloud. Chestnut plantations were detected with an overall accuracy of 81.5%. Individual trees were identified with a detection rate of 96%. The coefficient of determination R(2)value for tree height estimation was 0.83, while for the crown surface calculation it was 0.74. The accuracy achieved with these open-access databases makes the proposed procedure suitable for acquiring knowledge about the location and state of chestnut plantations as well as for monitoring their evolution.

TI  - A New Method for Reconstructing Absolute Water Vapor Maps From Persistent Scatterer InSAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Repeat-pass spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has increasingly been used to produce precipitable water vapor (PWV) maps at a high spatial resolution. Since the InSAR principle is based on building the difference between the observations at two acquisition times, a large part of the atmospheric phase is lost. Using PWV data from a global positioning system (GPS) network overlapping with the InSAR coverage or data from numerical atmospheric models and reanalysis data, a combining solution produces absolute PWV maps. The lack of dense GPS networks, the coarse spatial resolution of reanalysis data, and the inaccuracy of the models restrict the combined solution. Therefore, this article presents a new approach to reconstruct absolute PWV maps using persistent scatterer InSAR data in the presence of a single reference data point or a maximum of three. By applying this approach to Envisat InSAR data in the Dead Sea region and comparing the maps to 15 reference MERIS PWV maps, the results show an average of 92% spatial correlation, 1.2-mm absolute mean and 1.7-mm standard deviation. Sentinel-1 data as well show a strong spatial correlation (90.3%) with the model data with an average standard deviation of 1.6 mm.

TI  - Combination of sentinel lymph node mapping and uterine frozen section examination to reduce side-specific lymphadenectomy rate in endometrial cancer: a Turkish Gynecologic Oncology Group study (TRSGO-SLN-002)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective This study aimed to find out whether side-specific pelvic lymphadenectomy can be omitted without compromising diagnostic efficacy according to "reflex frozen section" analysis of the uterus in case of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping failure. Methods Patients who underwent surgery for endometrial cancer with an SLN algorithm were stratified as low-risk or high-risk according to the uterine features on the final pathology reports. Two models for low-risk patients were defined to omit side-specific pelvic lymphadenectomy: strategy A included patients with endometrioid histology, grade 1-2, and <50% myometrial invasion irrespective of the tumor diameter; strategy B included all factors of strategy A with the addition of tumor diameter <= 2 cm. Theoretical side-specific pelvic lymphadenectomy rates were calculated for the two strategies, assuming side-specific pelvic lymphadenectomy was omitted if low-risk features were present on reflex uterine frozen examination, and compared with the standard National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) SLN algorithm. Results 372 endometrial cancer patients were analyzed. 230 patients (61.8%) had endometrioid grade 1 or 2 tumors with <50% myometrial invasion (strategy A), and in 123 (53.4%) of these patients the tumor diameter was <= 2 cm (strategy B); 8 (3.5%) of the 230 cases had lymphatic metastasis. None of them were detected by side-specific pelvic lymphadenectomy and metastases were limited to SLNs in 7 patients. At least one pelvic side was not mapped in 107 (28.8%) cases in the entire cohort, and all of these cases would require a side-specific pelvic lymphadenectomy based on the NCCN SLN algorithm. This rate could have been significantly decreased to 11.8% and 19.4% by applying reflex frozen section examination of the uterus using strategy A and strategy B, respectively. Conclusion Reflex frozen section examination of the uterus can be a feasible option to decide whether side-specific pelvic lymphadenectomy is necessary for all the patients who failed to map with an SLN algorithm. If low-risk factors are found on frozen section examination, side-specific pelvic lymphadenectomy can be omitted without compromising diagnostic efficacy for lymphatic spread.

TI  - Automatic nighttime sea fog detection using GOES-16 imagery
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately detecting sea fog is important for oil and gas operations in the Grand Banks, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada. Although the Grand Banks is one of the foggiest places in the world, there is no remote sensing technique specifically developed for fog detection in this region. Therefore, an automatic approach was proposed in this study to detect Nighttime Sea Fog (NSF) and distinguish it from clear sky and ice cloud. To this end, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system-16 (GOES-16) imagery along with several ancillary datasets were employed. Selecting the Optimum Threshold Value (OTV) for identifying NSF in satellite images acquired at different times was also extensively discussed. The NSF maps obtained by the proposed method for 25 advection fog events in the study area were compared to surface-based weather observations (i.e., visibility data) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) global fog/low cloud products. The Probability of Detection (POD), False Alarm Rate (FAR), Hanssen-Kuiper Skill Score (KSS), and Equitable Threat Score (ETS) were 0.80, 0.08, 0.72, and 0.57, respectively, demonstrating the potential of the proposed NSF detection algorithm. Additionally, the results showed that the proposed method was better at discriminating Grand Banks fog than NOAA's algorithm in terms of both visual and statistical accuracies.

TI  - Retrieving soil moisture in rainfed and irrigated fields using Sentinel-2 observations and a modified OPTRAM approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil water content plays an important role in driving the exchange of latent and sensible heat between the atmosphere and land surface through transpiration and evaporation processes, regulating key physiological processes affecting plants growth. Given the high impact of water scarcity on yields, and of irrigated agriculture on the overall withdrawal rate of freshwater, it is important to define models that help to improve water resources management for agricultural purposes, and to optimize rainfed crop yield. Recent advances in satellite-based remote sensing have led to valuable solutions to estimate soil water content based on microwave or optical/thermal-infrared data. This study aims at improving soil water content estimation at high spatial and temporal resolution, by means of the Optical Trapezoid Model (OPTRAM) driven by Copernicus Sentinel-2 data. Two different model variations were considered, based on linear and nonlinear parameters constraints, and validated against in situ soil water content measurements made with time domain reflectometry (TDR) on irrigated maize in central Italy and on rainfed maize and pasture in northern Italy. For the first site the non-linear model shows a better correlation between measured and estimated soil water content values (r = 0.80) compared to the linear model (r = 0.73). In oth cases the modeled soil moisture tends to overestimate the measured values at medium to high water content level, while both models underestimate soil moisture at low water content level. Estimated versus measured normalized surface soil water for rainfed pasture plots from nonlinear OPTRAM parametrized based on irrigated maize parameterization (SIM1), and site-specific parametrization for rainfed pasture (SIM2), indicate that both models (SIM1 and SIM2) are comparable for rotational grazing pasture (RMSEsim1 = 0.0581 vs. RMSEsim2 = 0.0485 cm3 cm-3) and the continuous grazing pasture (RMSEsim1 = 0.0485 vs. RMSEsim2 = 0.0602 cm3 cm-3), while for the rainfed maize plots SIM1 shows lower RMSE (average for all plots RMSE = 0.0542 cm3 cm-3) compared to the site-specific calibration model (SIM2 - average for all plots RMSE = 0.0645 cm3 cm-3). Finally, OPTRAM estimations are close to in situ measurement values while Surface Soil Moisture at 1 km (SSM1 km) tends to underestimate the measurements during maize crop growing season. Soil moisture retrieval from high-resolution Sentinel-2 optical images allows water stress conditions to be effectively mapped, supporting decision making in irrigation scheduling and other crop management.

TI  - Conversations and Beyond Religious/Spiritual Care Needs Among Clinical Mental Health Patients in the Netherlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines religious/spiritual (R/S) care needs and their possible determinants among mental health patients in the Netherlands. Patients in a Christian (CC,n= 100) and a secular (SC,n= 101) mental health clinic completed a questionnaire. Analysis revealed three factors on the R/S care needs measure: (1) "R/S conversations," (2) "R/S program and recovery," and (3) "R/S similar outlook on life." The presence of R/S care needs was predicted by the following: site (CC versus SC), R/S involvement, and religious strain. Most commonly, unmet R/S care needs were explanation about R/S and illness by the practitioner, prayer with a nurse, conversations about religious distress with a nurse, conversation when R/S conflicts with treatment, help in finding a congregation, and contact between chaplain and practitioner. "R/S similar outlook on life" was equally important to patients with and without R/S involvement. Patients appreciate a match in worldview with health professionals, either religious or secular.

TI  - Monitoring Land Surface Deformation Associated with Gold Artisanal Mining in the Zaruma City (Ecuador)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground mining can produce subsidence phenomena, especially if orebodies are surficial or occur in soft rocks. In some countries, illegal mining is a big problem for environmental, social and economic reasons. However, when unauthorized excavation is conducted underground, it is even more dangerous because it can produce unexpected surficial collapses in areas not adequately monitored. For this reason, it is important to find quick and economic techniques able to give information about the spatial and temporal development of uncontrolled underground activities in order to improve the risk management. In this work, the differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) technique, implemented in the SUBSOFT software, has been used to study terrain deformation related to illegal artisanal mining in Ecuador. The study area is located in Zaruma (southeast of El Oro province), a remarkable site for Ecuadorian cultural heritage where, at the beginning of the 2017, a local school collapsed, due to sinkhole phenomena that occurred around the historical center. The school, named "Inmaculada Fe y Alegria", was located in an area where mining activity was forbidden. For this study, the surface deformations that occurred in the Zaruma area from 2015 to 2019 were detected by using the Sentinel-1 data derived from the Europe Space Agency of the Copernicus Program. Deformations of the order of five centimeters were revealed both in correspondence of known exploitation tunnels, but also in areas where the presence of tunnels had not been verified. In conclusion, this study allowed to detect land surface movements related to underground mining activity, confirming that the DInSAR technique can be applied for monitoring mining-related subsidence.

TI  - Harnessing the Complete Repertoire of Conventional Dendritic Cell Functions for Cancer Immunotherapy
T2  - PHARMACEUTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - The onset of checkpoint inhibition revolutionized the treatment of cancer. However, studies from the last decade suggested that the sole enhancement of T cell functionality might not suffice to fight malignancies in all individuals. Dendritic cells (DCs) are not only part of the innate immune system, but also generals of adaptive immunity and they orchestrate the de novo induction of tolerogenic and immunogenic T cell responses. Thus, combinatorial approaches addressing DCs and T cells in parallel represent an attractive strategy to achieve higher response rates across patients. However, this requires profound knowledge about the dynamic interplay of DCs, T cells, other immune and tumor cells. Here, we summarize the DC subsets present in mice and men and highlight conserved and divergent characteristics between different subsets and species. Thereby, we supply a resource of the molecular players involved in key functional features of DCs ranging from their sentinel function, the translation of the sensed environment at the DC:T cell interface to the resulting specialized T cell effector modules, as well as the influence of the tumor microenvironment on the DC function. As of today, mostly monocyte derived dendritic cells (moDCs) are used in autologous cell therapies after tumor antigen loading. While showing encouraging results in a fraction of patients, the overall clinical response rate is still not optimal. By disentangling the general aspects of DC biology, we provide rationales for the design of next generation DC vaccines enabling to exploit and manipulate the described pathways for the purpose of cancer immunotherapy in vivo. Finally, we discuss how DC-based vaccines might synergize with checkpoint inhibition in the treatment of malignant diseases.

TI  - Apparent evidence for Hawking points in the CMB Sky
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents strong observational evidence of numerous previously unobserved anomalous circular spots, of significantly raised temperature, in the cosmic microwave background sky. The spots have angular radii between 0.03 and 0.04 rad (i.e. angular diameters between about 3 degrees and 4 degrees). There is a clear cut-off at that size, indicating that each anomalous spot would have originated from a highly energetic point-like source, located at the end of inflation - or else point-like at the conformally expanded Big Bang, if it is considered that there was no inflationary phase. The significant presence of these anomalous spots, was initially noticed in the Planck 70 GHz satellite data by comparison with 1000 standard simulations, and then confirmed by extending the comparison to 10 000 simulations. Such anomalous points were then found at precisely the same locations in the WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) data, their significance was confirmed by comparison with 1000 WMAP simulations. Planck and WMAP have very different noise properties and it seems exceedingly unlikely that the observed presence of anomalous points in the same directions on both maps may come entirely from the noise. Subsequently, further confirmation was found in the Planck data by comparison with 1000 FFP8.1 MC simulations (with l <= 1500). The existence of such anomalous regions, resulting from point-like sources at the conformally stretched-out big bang, is a predicted consequence of conformal cyclic cosmology, these sources being the Hawking points of the theory, resulting from the Hawking radiation from supermassive black holes in a cosmic aeon prior to our own.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - NCCN Virtual Annual Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Locoregional management of early-stage breast cancer has been trending toward less-extensive axillary resections, based on increasing evidence showing that patients with 1 or 2 positive sentinel nodes and/or micrometastases can safely be managed with sentinel node biopsy alone, thereby avoiding complete axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) in the significant majority of patients. Because of the 15% to 20% lymphedema risk associated with cALND, increasing efforts are being made to avoid the procedure when evidence suggests that more limited procedures are safe, as reflected by acceptable locoregional recurrence rates. Axillary radiotherapy (RT) has been shown to be an effective alternative to ALND for patients fitting criteria from the pivotal AMAROS trial: patients with T1/T2 disease and are clinically node-negative, who undergo either breast-conserving therapy or mastectomy. Considerations for RT begin with the question of nodal involvement, with treatment planned accordingly. With more neoadjuvant therapy being used, there are nuances in locoregional management that clinicians must now appreciate, both in terms of ALND and axillary RT.

TI  - PUBLIC-PRIVATE INTERACTION IN CHILD WELFARE: LESSONS FOR CRITICAL SOCIAL WORK FROM CHILE AND THE UNITED STATES
T2  - TRABAJO SOCIAL GLOBAL-GLOBAL SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the public-private partnership that exists in Chile and in the United States to collaborate on issues of child welfare. By comparing both countries, we look at ideologies and economic issues that have historically shaped the contemporary perspective of public-private partnerships in child welfare. Additionally, we probe the role of social work in this area to see its current position within the public and private sectors in child welfare provision. Some conclusions are that neoliberalism and a residual worldview about childhood have shaped this public-private partnership. Also, social work has historically played a relevant role in advocacy and development of child policies and in both countries, private sector primarily implements child welfare policies and public sector funds them. Some of the lessons for critical social work include the importance of promoting a change in the way we address social phenomena in child welfare, and demanding an effective installation of the human rights approach to guide public-private partnerships on child welfare in both countries.

TI  - Cross-Calibration of MODIS Reflective Solar Bands With Sentinel 2A/2B MSI Instruments
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a 36-band spectroradiometer that measures the Earth's surface from 0.4 to 14.4 mu m at three spatial resolutions, 250 m (two bands), 500 m (five bands), and 1000 m (29 bands). The wide-scale use of the science products derived from the two MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua spacecrafts is a result of their excellent on-orbit performance, calibration stability, and accuracy through the life of the mission, making them a benchmark against which the performance of newer instruments is frequently evaluated. The recently launched multispectral instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel 2A and Sentinel 2B spacecrafts are part of the European Union's Copernicus program designed to acquire high spatial resolution imagery in the reflective spectrum from 0.4 to 2.2 mu m . One of the popular techniques to evaluate the on-orbit calibration is by comparing the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance with an independent (well-calibrated) sensor while viewing a pseudoinvariant desert target, such as Libya 4. In this work, the TOA reflectances from Terra and Aqua MODIS and Sentinel 2A and Sentinel 2B MSI are compared using the same-day scenes from Libya 4. The corrections for spectral response function mismatch and the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) are formulated and applied to obtain an effective TOA reflectance difference between the spectrally matching bands of these sensors. The availability of off-nadir MODIS overpass pairs with MSI facilitates the comparison across the entire MODIS scan-angle range and in turn an on-orbit evaluation of the response versus scan-angle (RVS) corrections is performed. Additionally, each MODIS instrument is used as a transfer mechanism to evaluate the calibration differences between the two MSIs, with an agreement to within 1% observed between the two MSIs. The radiometric calibration differences between Terra MODIS and the two MSIs at nadir is generally within 4%, with only the red-band pair (Terra MODIS band 1 and MSI band 4) showing disagreement beyond 4%. In general, the reflectance ratios are in better agreement with Aqua MODIS than with Terra MODIS. A better agreement between MODIS and the two MSIs is observed at nadir, indicating some residual effects associated with the BRDF correction that are observed in the off-nadir scene pairs. Also included in this article is a description of the various uncertainties associated with this cross-calibration.

TI  - Management of Regional Nodal Melanoma
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Regional nodal melanoma management has changed substantially over the past 2 decades alongside advances in systemic therapy. Significant data from retrospective studies and from 2 randomized controlled trials show no survival benefit to completion lymph node dissection compared with observation in sentinel lymph node-positive melanoma patients. Observation is becoming the standard recommendation in these patients, whereas patients with clinically detected lymph nodes are still recommended to undergo lymph node dissection. Promising early results from a neoadjuvant approach inform the ongoing evolution of melanoma management. Recruiting patients to clinical trials is paramount to attaining evidence-based practice changes in melanoma.

TI  - Flood Damage Area Detection Method by Means of Coherency Derived from Interferometric SAR Analysis with Sentinel-A SAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood damage area detection method by means of coherency derived from interferometric SAR analysis with Sentinel-A SAR is proposed. One of the key issues for flooding area detection is to estimate it as soon as possible. The flooding area due to heavy rain, typhoon, severe storm, however, is usually covered with clouds. Therefore, it is not easy to detect with optical imagers onboard remote sensing satellite. On the other hand, Synthetic Aperture Radar: SAR onboard remote sensing satellites allows to observe the flooding area even if it is cloudy and rainy weather conditions. Usually, flooding area shows relatively small back scattering cross section due to the fact that return signal from the water surface is quite small because of dielectric loss. It, however, is not clear enough of the flooding area detected by using return signal of SAR data from the water surface. The proposed method uses coherency derived from interferometric SAR analysis. Through experiment, it is found that the proposed method is useful to detect the flooding area clearly.

TI  - Context-dependent contributions to sentinel behaviour: audience, satiation and danger effects
T2  - ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
M3  - Article
AB  - In group-living species, particularly cooperative breeders, all group members contribute to various behaviours but there is considerable variation between and within individuals in their contributions. While it is well established that there is variation due to differences in the costs and benefits for individuals of different sex, age and dominance status, shorter-term social, internal and environmental factors are also likely to be important. Sentinel behaviour, where individuals adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates forage, offers an opportunity to test hypotheses about context-dependent differences in contributions to group behaviour. Here we used field experiments to manipulate the conspecific audience, satiation state and perceived danger level of dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula, to investigate how sentinel contributions are modulated by individual context. In addition to standard measures of sentinel behaviour (likelihood of becoming a sentinel, number of bouts, bout duration), we considered within-bout behaviour in terms of surveillance calls and attentiveness (head-scanning rate and distraction levels). We found that the presence of a neighbouring forager (audience) decreased sentinel contributions, while individuals increased their sentinel investment when satiated and experiencing an increased danger level. Changes in head-scanning rate provided evidence for an interaction between the effect of satiation and danger levels, demonstrating that sentinel attentiveness was influenced by changes in context. Our results demonstrate that sentinel behaviour is strongly context dependent, with effects seen in initial bout and bout quantity decisions, as well as within-bout characteristics, and that individual contributions to group behaviours can vary depending on social, internal and environmental factors.

TI  - Coupling coordination analysis of urbanization and eco-environment in Yanqi Basin based on multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - While multi-source remote sensing technology has the advantage of accurate and objective quantification, an understanding of the coupling and coordination between regional urbanization and ecological environment is the basis for achieving regional sustainable development. This paper builds the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) based on Landsat data and Tiangong-2 WIS, using multi-source remote sensing data to comprehensively evaluate the coupling and coordination relationship between urbanization and ecological environment with a coupling coordination degree model in China's typical arid area of Yanqin Basin during 2000-2018. The results show the RSEI index has a certain rationality and superiority in assessing the ecological environment. In 2000-2018, the ecological environment of the Yanqi Basin was optimized, the RSEI index increased by 23.06%, and the overall ecological environment was at a good level (0.6-0.8). At the same time, the urbanization level of each town had been significantly improved in Yanqi Basin. Through the urban center of gravity transfer model, it was found that direction of urban development shifted to the southwest direction by 7.49 km, which is basically consistent with the position of poor ecological environment. Finally the current urbanization and ecological environment coupling relationship in urban areas of Yanqi Basin was found to exhibit a sluggish rate of urbanization with a moderate imbalance between urbanization with ecological environment. Therefore, when making decisions for planning the regional economic development, the concept of ecological relationships should be integrated to effectively protect and achieve a healthy and sustainable development of the region.

TI  - The NASA Hydrological Forecast System for Food and Water Security Applications
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many regions in Africa and the Middle East are vulnerable to drought and to water and food insecurity, motivating agency efforts such as the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) to provide early warning of drought events in the region. Each year these warnings guide life-saving assistance that reaches millions of people. A new NASA multimodel, remote sensing-based hydrological forecasting and analysis system, NHyFAS, has been developed to support such efforts by improving the FEWS NET's current early warning capabilities. NHyFAS derives its skill from two sources: (i) accurate initial conditions, as produced by an offline land modeling system through the application and/or assimilation of various satellite data (precipitation, soil moisture, and terrestrial water storage), and (ii) meteorological forcing data during the forecast period as produced by a state-of-the-art ocean-land-atmosphere forecast system. The land modeling framework used is the Land Information System (LIS), which employs a suite of land surface models, allowing multimodel ensembles and multiple data assimilation strategies to better estimate land surface conditions. An evaluation of NHyFAS shows that its 1-5-month hindcasts successfully capture known historic drought events, and it has improved skill over benchmark-type hindcasts. The system also benefits from strong collaboration with end-user partners in Africa and the Middle East, who provide insights on strategies to formulate and communicate early warning indicators to water and food security communities. The additional lead time provided by this system will increase the speed, accuracy, and efficacy of humanitarian disaster relief, helping to save lives and livelihoods.

TI  - Investigation of wind speed effect on different mounted PV systems using satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Renewable energy utilization has been increasing at the same rate of the increasing the consumption of energy in all countries. The best use of the available energy and the search for different energy sources have been an important field of study all around the world after highly increasing of energy demand. Hence, today, generating energy from solar cells also called photovoltaics (PV) has become essential field of renewable energy. This energy source is also one of the fastest growing technology, converting direct sunlight to electricity. In this article, optimum tilt angles were examined by changing monthly, seasonal, and annually, which were obtained from PV panels installed in Bursa city of Turkey. It was found that the solar radiation increased by 22.21% for monthly, 21.17% for seasonal, and 16.44% for yearly. So, it was necessary to vary the tilt angle of the PV panels at least seasonal (four times a year). In addition, the cooling effect of the wind on the cell temperatures, electrical energy generation, and energy efficiency of the different mounted PV panels with the optimum tilt angle on a monthly basis was theoretically examined. Consequently, the wind cooling was shown to be very effective on cell temperatures and energy efficiency under wind cooling effect was more than 4.8% during a year. Another finding of this study was that the energy efficiency and generated electrical energies of free standing PV panels were higher than sloped-roof PV panels.

TI  - Urbanization, land use transformation and spatio-environmental impacts: Analyses of trends and implications in major metropolitan regions of Ghana
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization induces spatial and environmental changes. Monitoring and understanding the nature of these changes is crucial to achieving sustainable urban development imperatives. To this end, this paper examines the evolution and spatio-environmental impacts of rapid urbanization in two major metropolitan regions of Ghana-Accra-City Region and the Greater Kumasi Sub-Region. The analysis uses Landsat satellite data and landscape metrics to examine land use transitions and to characterize the emergent landscapes over the last three decades. The results show that built-up land has increased significantly in these metropolitan regions largely at the expense of environmental land cover classes. The expansion process follows a general trend where the historical-core zones were initially sites of rapid land cover conversion to built-up, with settlements in the suburban and peripheral zones expanding in recent years and becoming integrated into the conterminous urban areas of the metropolitan regions. The analysis also uncovered a unique, dynamic and complex process whereby the urban-open-space class, being in a permanent state of flux, mediates transitions between built-up land and vegetation and vice versa. The metric-based land use transformation analysis shows that the landscape of the metropolitan regions has fragmented because of an increased expansion and aggregation of patches of built-up land in the core areas and leapfrog, sprawling expansion in the outlying suburban and peripheral zones. The paper concludes on the need for integrative urban growth management strategies that brings together spatial planning and environmental resource governance to avert the negative consequences on the natural environment of unfettered urban expansion.

TI  - Characterization of microseepage-induced diagenetic changes in the Upper-Red Formation, Qom region, Iran. Part I: Outcrop, geochemical, and remote sensing studies
T2  - MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the footprints of hydrocarbon microseepage in the Upper-Red Formation covering the Alborz petroleum reservoir in the Saveh-Qom basin, Iran. The adopted multidisciplinary approach combines field observation and sampling, detailed petrographical and geochemical analysis, and remote sensing mapping using Sentinel-2 and ASTER satellite data. The study revealed significant changes in the microseepage-affected zones when contrasted to unaffected lithofacies and led to the establishment of a new array of mineralogical and geochemical indicators for the phenomenon. These comprise partial bleaching of the red-beds, secondary goethite coatings, diagenetic clay minerals (e.g. illite-smectite, chlorite), and pervasive calcite, silica, and gypsum cementations. In terms of geochemistry, the major oxides, particularly the ratio of CaO + K2O/Na2O + MgO + CaO + K2O proved to be a reliable index for distinguishing microseepage-prone areas. Based on isotopic studies, a combination of three sources of carbon, comprising oxidized hydrocarbons, was recognized in the carbonate cements; yet the strata were shown to be moderately flushed by percolating fluids. Satellite remote sensing was successful in mapping reservoir-scale footprints of the microseepage systems. It indicated that the extent of the induced alterations, and thereby the outline of the underlying reservoir, is much larger than previously known. Overall, the secondary changes were shown to be a function of the geochemistry of the hostrock, the local environmental variables (i.e. climate and hydrogeology), and the 3D architecture of the trap. The substantiated indicators carry direct implications for onshore microseepage targeting and hold high potential to help reduce the exploration and development risks in frontier and mature basins.

TI  - Combining multisource satellite data to estimate storage variation of a lake in the Rift Valley Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Integration of remote sensing data sets from multiple satellites is tested to simulate water storage variation of Lake Ziway, Ethiopia for the period 2009-2018. Sixty Landsat ETM+/OLI images served to trace temporal variation of lake surface area using a water extraction index. Time series of lake levels were acquired from two altimetry databases that were validated by in-situ lake level measurements. Coinciding pairs of optical satellite based lake surface area and radar altimetry based lake levels were related through regression and served for simulating lake storage variation. Indices for extracting lake surface area from images showed 91-99 % overall accuracy. Lake water levels from the altimetry products well agreed to in-situ lake level measurements with R-2 = 0.92 and root mean square error of 11.9 cm. Based on this study we conclude that integrating satellite imagery and radar altimetry is a viable approach for frequent and accurate monitoring of lake water volume variation and for long-term change detection. Findings indicate water level reduction (4 cm/annum), surface area shrinkage (0.08km(2)/annum) and water storage loss (20.4Mm(3)/annum) of Lake Ziway (2009-2018).

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Pixel and Object Based Classification Approach for Rapid Landslide Delineation with the Aid of Open Source Tools in Garhwal Himalaya
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are the natural geomorphic processes that are essential for the landscape development. Loss of tremendous amount of life, natural resources as well as property has made this phenomenon a natural disaster. Number of researches have been done to understand this phenomenon and how to overcome this calamity with the aid of upcoming modern information services and technological advancements. Despite all these, there are still certain undocumented slope failure events due to inaccessibility and lack of a proper database. With the advancement of satellite remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS), it has certainly become easier to monitor and prepare landslide database especially in rough and rugged terrain of the Himalaya for delineation of risk zones. Free availability of high-resolution images and an open source efficient software have certainly been proved advantageous for this purpose. This paper aims at quick and accurate landslide inventory mapping, using high resolution Sentinel 2 data along with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), over which unsupervised and object-based image analysis (OBIA) was done to extract landslide features in an efficient manner. Both these processes were achieved with the aid of open source SAGA (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses) software. The performances of these classifications were analyzed for their quantitative reliability in extracting the landslide features in two different areas (test area 1 and 2). In this, the object based image classification outstands, with the overall accuracy percentage difference of 17.11% higher than pixel-based classification approach in test area 1 and about 21% higher in test area 2.

TI  - Associated Features with Non-Sentinel Lymph Node Involvement in Early Stage Breast Cancer Patients who Have Positive Macrometastatic Sentinel Lymph Node
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Elie main goal of this study is to determine the clinico-pathological factors that correlate non-sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) involvement in clinically negative breast cancer (BC) patients with positive macrometastaric sentinel lymph node (SLN) in order to derive future evidence to define a subgroup where completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) might not be recommended.Materials and Methods: Total 289 SLN biopsies were performed in clinically node negative BC patients between March 2014 and April 2017. Seventy patients who performed cALND due to positive macromerasratic SLN were retrospectively selected and classified into two groups, according to non-SLN involvement (NSLNI). Clinico-pathological features of patients were examined computerized and documentary archives.Results: Extracapsular extension (ECE) of SLN, number of harvested SLNs, metastatic rate of SLNs, absence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and presence of multilocalization were significantly associated with the likelihood of non-SLN involvement after univariate analysis (p<0,05). Absence of DCIS and presence of multilocalization were found to be significant after multivariate analysis.Conclusion: Careful examination of clinico-pathological features can help to decide avoiding cALND if enough LNs are removed and the rate of SLN metastases is low, particularly in case DCIS accompanying invasive cancer in patients without multi localized tumour.

T2  - GRANULAR COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Collection of quality-labeled training samples in the area of remote sensing is very difficult, costly, time-consuming, and tedious due to various constraints. Classification of remote-sensing images is a challenging task due to the limited availability of quality-labeled samples for the training process. To solve the problem of labeled samples, various semi-supervised techniques have been designed and explored for the classification of remote-sensing images. Self-training is a popular semi-supervised method widely used for the training of supervised classifier with limited labeled and a large pool of unlabeled samples. However, the traditional self-training approach gives poor performance for the classification of remote-sensing images. The traditional self-training method selects samples only on the basis of maximum classification probability criterion which may not improve the classifier accuracy. The effectiveness of the classifiers trained in the self-training fashion depends on the selection of correct, diverse, and informative samples for the labeled training set. In this paper, granular computing concepts have been utilized to improve the self-training approach for the classification of the remote-sensing images. The proposed approach first groups the unlabeled samples into several numbers of granules. After that, a supervised classifier is trained with few labeled samples and the trained classifier is used to select the most confident granules set. The selected most confident granules help to add qualitative samples into the labeled set for the effective training of the classifiers. The experimental results with three benchmark remote-sensing data sets show that the proposed method has produced improvement in the classification accuracy.

TI  - Systemic adjuvant therapy for adult patients at high risk for recurrent melanoma: A systematic review
T2  - CANCER TREATMENT REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous melanoma is typically treated with wide local excision and, when appropriate, a sentinel node biopsy. Many patients are cured with this approach but for patients who have cancers with high risk features there is a significant risk of local and distant relapse and death. Interferon-based adjuvant therapy was recommended in the past but had modest results with significant toxicity. Recently, new therapies (immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies) have been found to be effective in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma and many of these therapies have been evaluated and found to be effective in the adjuvant treatment of high risk patients with melanoma. This systematic review of adjuvant therapies for cutaneous and mucosal melanoma was conducted for Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) as the basis of a clinical practice guideline to address the question of whether patients with completely resected melanoma should be considered for adjuvant systemic therapy and which adjuvant therapy should be used.

TI  - FROM ALPHABETICAL MYSTICISM TO THEOSOPHICAL KABBALAH: A RARE WITNESS TO AN INTERMEDIATE STAGE OF MOSES DE LEON'S THOUGHT
T2  - REVUE DES ETUDES JUIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates Moses de Leon's early kabbalistic thought through a cluster of his unsigned works in manuscript, some of which have only recently come to light, and others of which have not received any scholarly attention at all. The analysis of these works reveals an intermediate stage of his thought that bridges his earlier esoteric writing with the later, and more familiar, theosophical compositions that bear his name. The folia of these unsigned works are replete with speculations concerning the letters of the Hebrew alphabet and the names of God, through which de Leon expressed a unique blend of theology and angelology that was shaped, mainly, by Aristotelian paradigms. Scholars previously posited that de Leon, and other kabbalists active in roughly the same time and place, abruptly and mysteriously abandoned this worldview for a new one predicated on the theosophical foundation of a multiplicity of attributes or sephirot within the emanated Godhead. Through careful study of these works in manuscript, particularly a neglected work in MS Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibl., hebr. 47, the author recovers a transitional period in de Leon's thought, when he had not quite given up one conceptual paradigm for the other. A new historiographical account is then proposed, according to which Castilian kabbalists living in the generation of the Zohar absorbed the new theosophy slowly and tried to incorporate it into existing paradigms, resulting in unique hybrids, even as they also consolidated new modes of speculation. This article therefore provides an alternative account of a critical stage in the history of medieval kabbalah, one which concerns the fundamental stratum of the so-called Sepher ha-Zohar. In addition to deepening our knowledge of the conceptual humus from which the Zohar's foundational concepts germinated, the findings of this study force us to reconsider what we know about the appearance of the most canonical work in Kabbalistic literature.

TI  - A Novel Approach for Satellite-Based Turbulence Nowcasting for Aviation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The predictability of aviation turbulence is influenced by energy-intensive flow patterns that are significantly smaller than the horizontal grid scale of current numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The parameterization of these subgrid scale (SGS) processes is possible by means of an additional prognostic equation for the temporal change of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), whereby scale transfer terms are used. This turbulence scheme has been applied operationally for 5 years in the NWP model ICON (Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic). The most important of the source terms parameterizes the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, better known as clear air turbulence. This shear term was subjected to a nowcasting technique, is calculated with satellite data, and shifted forward in time using motion based on optical flow estimates and atmospheric motion vector (AMV). The nowcasts include turbulence altitude as determined by an adapted height assignment scheme presented here. The case studies illustrate that the novel approach for satellite-based turbulence nowcasting is a supplement to the NWP models.

TI  - Continuous Daily Evapotranspiration with Optical Spaceborne Observations at Sub-Kilometre Spatial Resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key parameter in the description of the energy and water fluxes over land. Continuous and spatially detailed ET simulations are thus required for a number of scientific and management-related purposes. These conditions are determined by the modelling approach and the composition of the forcing dataset. This study aimed at simulating daily ET in a diversity of climate and land cover conditions at a spatial resolution of similar to 1 km and higher. The modelling approach was based on the algorithm driving the ET product developed and set in operations in the framework of the Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis programme (LSA-SAF). The implemented algorithm allowed the ingestion of biophysical parameters derived from SPOT-V and PROBA-V observations developed by the Copernicus Global Land Programme, as well as other model parameters at a similar spatial resolution. The model was tested at an similar to 1 km spatial resolution in over 40 sites located in different climate and land cover contexts. The implementation at similar to 300 m was tested in the upper Biebrza basin, in Poland. The simulations correlated well with the validation dataset (r2 > 0.75 in 80% of sites) and exhibited root mean squared values lower than 1 mm/day in 80% of the cases. The results also pointed to the need for refining the accuracy of soil moisture data sources, especially in dry areas. The results showed the ability of the modelling approach and the SPOT-V/PROBA-V missions to support the generation of long ET time series. They also opened the gate to incorporate Sentinel-3 in ET continuous modelling.

TI  - THE SHADOW OF THE SUBMERGED ONES
T2  - LITERATURA E SOCIEDADE
M3  - Article
AB  - The division between the drowned and the saved is the key division of Primo Levi's worldview. The "internal submerged" (Di Castro) present in every survivor unfolds in the submerged as Doppelganger, an internal voice oscillating between the metaphor of a persecutory shadow (present in his poetry) and the representation of his brotherly friend Alberto. The urgency of the testimony is faced with the question of how to represent the drowned, the only ones who could return a truly comprehensive testimony. However, the writer finds a "surviving word" (Derrida) to probe the facets of shame, interrogate the ghosts of guilt and outline the "grey zone". Despite this insurmountable wound, Levi refuses the idea of a deserved privilege, nor does he need the comfort of divine providence: several factors contributed to his salvation, but the forces at work are chance and luck. Since Fortuna, as Robert Gordon points out, is a mythical force that our culture has always used to deal with the incomprehensible and uncontrollable reality, in the case of the survivor it fills the distressing absence of explanations; in Levi it becomes a support point to combat the feeling of guilt and to compose the literary representation of events. Survival is, therefore, something "strange". Origin, evolution, adaptation, natural selection, clash between order and chaos converge in the short story "Carbono" and demonstrate that, after all, the pole of greatest attraction of all his production is the question: who survives and why?

TI  - A Multi-Scale Approach to Predict the Fractional Cover of Medusahead (<i>Taeniatherum Caput-Medusae</i>)
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Medusahead is an aggressive, winter annual that is of dire concern for the health and sustainability of western rangelands in the United States. Medusahead reduces plant diversity, alters ecosystem function, and reduces carrying capacities for both livestock and wildlife. The species has competitive advantages over cheatgrass and native grasses that causes an increased amount of fine fuels deposited on western rangelands. The Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington in the United States represent a typical example of a region being challenged by the expansion of this weed. The costs of the invasion are high and financial constraints can limit successful management. Managers need the ability to identify medusahead across entire landscapes, so they can work towards effective and efficient management approaches. Remote sensing offers the ability to measure vegetation cover at large spatial scales, which can lead to a better understanding of the invasive characteristics of problematic species like medusahead. For instance, research has been successful in creating large-scale distribution maps of cheatgrass over western rangelands. Many applications rely on the phenological characteristics of a target plant which can present problems in separating two species with similar phenologies (i.e. cheatgrass & medusahead). A medusahead-specific map gives managers the flexibility to prioritize and direct management needs when attempting to control the spread of medusahead into non-invaded areas. This study integrated GPS acquired field locations from three study sites (Sites S, C, & N) and imagery from two remote sensing platforms (1-m aerial imagery & 30-m Landsat), to model and predict fractional cover of medusahead over 37,000+ ha of rangelands in the Channeled Scabland region of eastern Washington. Using a multi-scaled approach, this research showed that regression tree algorithms can model the complex spectral response of senesced medusahead using late summer Landsat scenes. The predictive performances resulted in a R-2 of 0.80 near the model's training site (Site S) and an average R-2 of 0.68 away from the training site (Sites C & N). This research provides a non-phenological approach to produce accurate large-scale, distribution maps of medusahead which can aid land managers who are challenged by its invasion.

TI  - A Novel Rayleigh Dynamical Model for Remote Sensing Data Interpretation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article introduces the Rayleigh autoregressive moving average (RARMA) model, which is useful to interpret multiple different sets of remotely sensed data, from wind measurements to multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sequences. The RARMA model is indeed suitable for continuous, asymmetric, and nonnegative signals observed over time. It describes the mean of Rayleigh-distributed discrete-time signals by a dynamic structure including autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) terms, a set of regressors, and a link function. After presenting the conditional likelihood inference for the model parameters and the detection theory, in this article, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed to evaluate the finite signal length performance of the conditional likelihood inferences. Finally, the new model is applied first to sequences of wind speed measurements, and then to a multitemporal SAR image stack for land-use classification purposes. The results in these two test cases illustrate the usefulness of this novel dynamic model for remote sensing data interpretation.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXIC EXPOSURES USING COMPANION ANIMALS AS AN INDICATOR OF HUMAN TOXICITY: A CASE REPORT AND DISCUSSION
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - , Abstract-Background: Hundreds of years ago, humans realized that animals could be used as surrogate indicators of toxic environmental exposures, as a tool to measure risk to human health. The classic example is coal miners bringing canaries into coal mines. The respiratory rate and metabolism of the animal resulted in toxic signs of injurious gases in the environment before humans were injured. Occasionally, modern diagnosis of cryptic toxic exposures can be aided by the discovery of such features in the history. Objectives: We introduce this review using a case of inhalational mercury toxicity involving humans and companion animals-household dogs and cats. The death of exposed pets prior to the mounting of symptoms in the exposed humans was advance warning of the near-fatal presentation to come. Our objective was to review and characterize the state of the literature on companion animals as sentinel species. Discussion: We reviewed 748 articles, which resulted in 25 selected for inclusion in this narrative review. We detail examples of companion animals (household dogs, cats, and birds) affected by toxic exposures in acute and chronic ways-acting as harbingers of impending human toxicity in acute or chronic settings. Mercury, lead, Teflon, herbicide, and asbestos exposures present with predictable signs and symptoms in companion animals prior to presenting in humans. Identifying the toxidrome in a companion animal allows for subclinical identification of exposure and consequences in the human that permits early treatment and intervention. Conclusions: Companion animals, when similarly exposed to toxic substances as humans regarding route, dose, and chronicity often mount symptoms and signs in advance of humans. This phenomenon allows the clinician to identify occult exposure, test, and treat while human dis

TI  - Development and characterization of a handheld radiation detector for radio-guided surgery
T2  - RADIATION MEASUREMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current state-of-the-art breast surgery uses radioactive brachytherapy sources to indicate the center of the tumor and possibly a few points on the periphery as seen on mammography. Since such guidance is very coarse, tumor free margins are not achievable in many cases and a re-excision procedure is often required. Better radiation guidance (radio-guidance) could come from labelling cancer cells directly with a radionuclide, such as the agent CLR1404. The agent CLR1404 is taken up by breast cancer cells but not normal cells and, labelled with radioactive I-123, could image the whole tumor, not just points. Tc-99m-labelled nanoparticles are used to locate sentinel lymph nodes. Simultaneous detection and differentiation of the photon energies 159 keV from I-123 and 141 keV from Tc-99m requires a radiation detector with high energy resolution and sufficient efficiency. This report involves the design, development and characterization of such a handheld radiation detector. Following the design and integration of the detector, the main characteristics of the detector, such as energy resolution, photopeak efficiency and response at different source-to-detector distances were investigated experimentally. Energy resolution of the detector was found to be less than 10 keV (FWHM) at energies below 159 keV, which allowed discerning the radiation from the two radionuclides. Energy spectra of the radioactive sources acquired experimentally were compared to those simulated in Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code (MCNP6X). The detector developed was found to be promising for radiation-guided surgery applications.

TI  - Feasibility of Using the Two-Source Energy Balance Model (TSEB) with Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 Images to Analyze the Spatio-Temporal Variability of Vine Water Status in a Vineyard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In viticulture, detailed spatial information about actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and vine water status within a vineyard may be of particular utility when applying site-specific, precision irrigation management. Over recent decades, extensive research has been carried out in the use of remote sensing energy balance models to estimate and monitor ET(a)at the field level. However, one of the major limitations remains the coarse spatial resolution in the thermal infrared (TIR) domain. In this context, the recent advent of the Sentinel missions of the European Space Agency (ESA) has greatly improved the possibility of monitoring crop parameters and estimating ET(a)at higher temporal and spatial resolutions. In order to bridge the gap between the coarse-resolution Sentinel-3 thermal and the fine-resolution Sentinel-2 shortwave data, sharpening techniques have been used to downscale the Sentinel-3 land surface temperature (LST) from 1 km to 20 m. However, the accurate estimates of high-resolution LST through sharpening techniques are still unclear, particularly when intended to be used for detecting crop water stress. The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of the two-source energy balance model (TSEB) using sharpened LST images from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 (TSEB-PTS2+3) to estimate the spatio-temporal variability of actual transpiration (T) and water stress in a vineyard. T and crop water stress index (CWSI) estimates were evaluated against a vine water consumption model and regressed with in situ stem water potential (psi(stem)). Two different TSEB approaches, using very high-resolution airborne thermal imagery, were also included in the analysis as benchmarks for TSEB-PTS2+3. One of them uses aggregated TIR data at the vine+inter-row level (TSEB-PTairb), while the other is based on a contextual method that directly, although separately, retrieves soil and canopy temperatures (TSEB-2T). The results obtained demonstrated that when comparing airborne T(rad)and sharpened S2+3 LST, the latter tend to be underestimated. This complicates the use of TSEB-PT(S2+3)to detect crop water stress. TSEB-2T appeared to outperform all the other methods. This was shown by a higherR(2)and slightly lower RMSD when compared with modelled T. In addition, regressions between T and CWSI-2T with psi(stem)also produced the highestR(2).

TI  - Earth remote sensing imagery classification using a multi-sensor super-resolution fusion algorithm
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth remote sensing data fusion is intended to produce images of higher quality than the original ones. However, the fusion impact on further thematic processing remains an open question because fusion methods are mostly used to improve the visual data representation. This article addresses an issue of the effect of fusion with increasing spatial and spectral resolution of data on thematic classification of images using various state-of-the-art classifiers and features extraction methods. In this paper, we use our own algorithm to perform multi-frame image fusion over optical remote sensing images with different spatial and spectral resolutions. For classification, we applied support vector machines and Random Forest algorithms. For features, we used spectral channels, extended attribute profiles and local feature attribute profiles. An experimental study was carried out using model images of four imaging systems. The resulting image had a spatial resolution of 2.3.4 and 5 times better than for the original images of each imaging system, respectively. As a result of our studies, it was revealed that for the support vector machines method, fusion was inexpedient since excessive spatial details had a negative effect on the classification. For the Random Forest algorithm, the classification results of a fused image were more accurate than for the original low-resolution images in 90% of cases. For example, for images with the smallest difference in spatial resolution (2 times) from the fusion result, the classification accuracy of the fused image was on average 4% higher. In addition, the results obtained for the Random Forest algorithm with fusion were better than the results for the support vector machines method without fusion. Additionally, it was shown that the classification accuracy of a fused image using the Random Forest method could be increased by an average of 9% due to the use of extended attribute profiles as features. Thus, when using data fusion, it is better to use the Random Forest classifier, whereas using fusion with the support vector machines method is not recommended.

T2  - ANNALI ITALIANI DI CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE: To summarize and compare the most recent data from the literature to clarify the management of male breast cancer.METHODS: A review article.RESULTS: Diagnosis and Treatment of Male Breast Cancer have been derivative for years. Nowadays MBC is a nosological entity in its own right with biological, molecular and clinical features that require a multidisciplinary approach and the involvement of specific skills. Multimodal treatment involves surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It is evident that the outcome of the MBC is worse than the female one. MBC is often diagnosed in advanced stages. Screening programs in the male population need to be strengthened to obtain an earlier diagnosis. It is necessary to know even more in depth the endocrine-metabolic and behavioral risk factors related to the neoplasm. Finally in the coming years it is reasonable to expect an improvement in multigenic tests: the sensitivity of these methods could predict the risk of recurrence even more precisely. This could lead to substantial changes in the choice and duration of treatment with results that could be surprising.

TI  - Aboriginal artefacts on the continental shelf reveal ancient drowned cultural landscapes in northwest Australia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article reports Australia's first confirmed ancient underwater archaeological sites from the continental shelf, located off the Murujuga coastline in north-western Australia. Details on two underwater sites are reported: Cape Bruguieres, comprising > 260 recorded lithic artefacts at depths down to -2.4 m below sea level, and Flying Foam Passage where the find spot is associated with a submerged freshwater spring at -14 m. The sites were discovered through a purposeful research strategy designed to identify underwater targets, using an iterative process incorporating a variety of aerial and underwater remote sensing techniques and diver investigation within a predictive framework to map the submerged landscape within a depth range of 0-20 m. The condition and context of the lithic artefacts are analysed in order to unravel their depositional and taphonomic history and to corroborate their in situ position on a pre-inundation land surface, taking account of known geomorphological and climatic processes including cyclone activity that could have caused displacement and transportation from adjacent coasts. Geomorphological data and radiometric dates establish the chronological limits of the sites and demonstrate that they cannot be later than 7000 cal BP and 8500 cal BP respectively, based on the dates when they were finally submerged by sea-level rise. Comparison of underwater and onshore lithic assemblages shows differences that are consistent with this chronological interpretation. This article sets a foundation for the research strategies and technologies needed to identify archaeological targets at greater depth on the Australian continental shelf and elsewhere, building on the results presented. Emphasis is also placed on the need for legislation to better protect and manage underwater cultural heritage on the 2 million square kilometres of drowned landscapes that were once available for occupation in Australia, and where a major part of its human history must lie waiting to be discovered.

TI  - Nomogram Predicting the Likelihood of Parametrial Involvement in Early-Stage Cervical Cancer: Avoiding Unjustified Radical Hysterectomies
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We aimed to establish a tool predicting parametrial involvement (PI) in patients with early-stage cervical cancer and select a sub-group of patients who would most benefit from a less radical surgery. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients from two prospective multicentric databases-SENTICOL I and II-from 2005 to 2012. Patients with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO 2018 IA with lympho-vascular involvement to IIA1), undergoing radical surgery (hysterectomy or trachelectomy) with bilateral sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping with no metastatic node or PI on pre-operative imaging, were included. Results: In total, 5.2% patients (11/211) presented a histologic PI. After univariate analysis, SLN status, lympho-vascular space invasion, deep stromal invasion and tumor size were significantly associated with PI and were included in our nomogram. Our predictive model had an AUC of 0.92 (IC95% = 0.86-0.98) and presented a good calibration. A low risk group, defined according to the optimal sensitivity and specificity, presented a predicted probability of PI of 2%. Conclusion: Patients could benefit from a two-step approach. Final surgery (i.e. radical surgery and/or lymphadenectomy) would depend on the SLN status and the probability PI calculated after an initial conization with bilateral SLN mapping.

TI  - The Opening of the Literary Canon: Concha Alos's Narrative for a SFL Class C1 Level
T2  - ALABE-REVISTA DE INVESTIGACION SOBRE LECTURA Y ESCRITURA
M3  - Article
AB  - Literature together with cinema, theater, documentary, and music, is a useful instrument for teaching and learning - both guided and autonomous - of a foreign language. In this paper we present a didactic proposal addressed to students of Spanish as a Foreign Language (SFL) of level C1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). Didactic intervention starts from the exploitation of some fragments of El Caballo Rojo, a novel published by Concha Alos in 1966. Likewise, this work is part of the recovery of texts forgotten by the canon and the vindication of an author absent from the History of recent Spanish Literature. In this way, the first part of the article reflects on the limitations of the literary corpus in relation to what is called literature written by women. In the second part, a didactic intervention for a SFL classroom will be articulated and developed.

TI  - Uncovering Dryland Woody Dynamics Using Optical, Microwave, and Field Data-Prolonged Above-Average Rainfall Paradoxically Contributes to Woody Plant Die-Off in the Western Sahel
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dryland ecosystems are frequently struck by droughts. Yet, woody vegetation is often able to recover from mortality events once precipitation returns to pre-drought conditions. Climate change, however, may impact woody vegetation resilience due to more extreme and frequent droughts. Thus, better understanding how woody vegetation responds to drought events is essential. We used a phenology-based remote sensing approach coupled with field data to estimate the severity and recovery rates of a large scale die-off event that occurred in 2014-2015 in Senegal. Novel low (L-band) and high-frequency (Ku-band) passive microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD), and optical MODIS data, were used to estimate woody vegetation dynamics. The relative importance of soil, human-pressure, and before-drought vegetation dynamics influencing the woody vegetation response to the drought were assessed. The die-off in 2014-2015 represented the highest dry season VOD drop for the studied period (1989-2017), even though the 2014 drought was not as severe as the droughts in the 1980s and 1990s. The spatially explicit Die-off Severity Index derived in this study, at 500 m resolution, highlights woody plants mortality in the study area. Soil physical characteristics highly affected die-off severity and post-disturbance recovery, but pre-drought biomass accumulation (i.e., in areas that benefited from above-normal rainfall conditions before the 2014 drought) was the most important variable in explaining die-off severity. This study provides new evidence supporting a better understanding of the "greening Sahel", suggesting that a sudden increase in woody vegetation biomass does not necessarily imply a stable ecosystem recovery from the droughts in the 1980s. Instead, prolonged above-normal rainfall conditions prior to a drought may result in the accumulation of woody biomass, creating the basis for potentially large-scale woody vegetation die-off events due to even moderate dry spells.

TI  - Estimating Impacts of Dam Development and Landscape Changes on Suspended Sediment Concentrations in the Mekong River Basin's 3S Tributaries
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mekong River Basin (MRB) is undergoing rapid dam development, which is altering the river suspended sediment concentration (SSC). In this study, we used satellite remote sensing records spanning 31 years to detect SSC changes (SSC prediction r2=0.78, RMSE=21.2 mg/L) due to dam development. We focused on the 3S basin of the MRB. We also used satellite data on nighttime lights, which reflect human settlement patterns, and land cover to explain SSC patterns. Our technique allowed for quantification of SSC changes due to dam construction (e.g., +120 mg/L near basin outlet), reservoir sediment trapping (e.g., -108 mg/L), deforestation, and human settlement (e.g., +117 mg/L near impacts). Our technique also demonstrated how the SSC of the 3S rivers compared to that of the Mekong mainstem over time (e.g., from similar to 13% to 100% greater). Our comprehensive analyses of SSC records with dam development indicate that SSC changes will continue with ongoing dam and landscape development in the MRB. From a hydrologic perspective, SSC monitoring will be imperative for effective sediment and water management. Our satellite-based approach answers critical sediment needs of improved monitoring and adaptive management throughout the MRB and other global locations for practitioners who are engaged in real-world management of their river basins.

TI  - Arctic multiyear sea ice variability observed from satellites: a review
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In comparison with seasonal sea ice (first-year ice, FY ice), multiyear (MY) sea ice is thicker and has more opportunity to survive through the summer melting seasons. Therefore, the variability of wintertime MY ice plays a vital role in modulating the variations in the Arctic sea ice minimum extent during the following summer. As a response, the ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions may be significantly affected by the variations in the MY ice cover. Satellite observations are characterized by their capability to capture the spatiotemporal changes of Arctic sea ice. During the recent decades, many active and passive sensors onboard a variety of satellites (QuikSCAT, ASCAT, SSMIS, ICESat, CryoSat-2, etc.) have been used to monitor the dramatic loss of Arctic MY ice. The main objective of this study is to outline the advances and remaining challenges in monitoring the MY ice changes through the utilization of multiple satellite observations. We summarize the primary satellite data sources that are used to identify MY ice. The methodology to classify MY ice and derive MY ice concentration is reviewed. The interannual variability and trends in the MY ice time series in terms of coverage, thickness, volume, and age composition are evaluated. The potential causes associated with the observed Arctic MY ice loss are outlined, which are primarily related to the export and melting mechanisms. In addition, the causes to the MY ice depletion from the perspective of the oceanic water inflow from Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and the water vapor intrusion, as well as the roles of synoptic weather, are analyzed. The remaining challenges and possible upcoming research subjects in detecting the rapidly changing Arctic MY ice using the combined application of multisource remote sensing techniques are discussed. Moreover, some suggestions for the future application of satellite observations on the investigations of MY ice cover changes are proposed.

TI  - Surface Slip Distribution Along the West Helanshan Fault, Northern China, and Its Implications for Fault Behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution topographic data sets have now become increasingly available, which allows for remotely measuring and analyzing offset features and their associated slip distributions at a very high resolution along a fault, hence providing important insights into the fault behavior. The West Helanshan Fault is a Holocene active right-lateral strike-slip fault located at the junction of the Tibetan Plateau, Alashan, and Ordos blocks. In this study, a 2-m-resolution DEM of the West Helanshan Fault was built from the WorldView-3 stereo satellite images (0.5 m). Combined with the high-resolution topography acquired from the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images based on the Structure from Motion (SfM) method, a total of 180 lateral offsets and 201 vertical displacements were acquired along similar to 50 km of the fault. By statistical analysis of the offset observations and constructing the cumulative slip profiles, we conclude that large paleoearthquakes have produced characteristic slip accumulation along the fault with a right-lateral slip of similar to 3 m and a vertical slip of similar to 1 m, rupturing at least two segments of the fault simultaneously, which corresponds to a moment magnitude of M-w 7.1 similar to 7.5. The cumulative slip profiles suggest that the fault has likely propagated northward over its lifetime, and the south segment may be the most mature section of the fault where larger coseismic slip of earthquake ruptures may occur. The ratio of lateral to vertical displacement has remained constant (similar to 3:1) through multiple successive events, indicating that the fault has maintained the same kinematic style over the last few thousands of years.

TI  - Land Cover Changes and Flows in the Polish Baltic Coastal Zone: A Qualitative and Quantitative Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting land cover changes requires timely and accurate information, which can be assured by using remotely sensed data and Geographic Information System(GIS). This paper examines spatiotemporal trends in land cover changes in the Polish Baltic coastal zone, especially the urbanisation, loss of agricultural land, afforestation, and deforestation. The dynamics of land cover change and its impact were discussed as the major findings. The analysis revealed that land cover changes on the Polish Baltic coast have been consistent throughout the 1990-2018 period, and in the consecutive inventories of land cover, they have changed faster. As shown in the research, the area of agricultural land was subject to significant change, i.e., about 40% of the initial 8% of the land area in heterogeneous agriculture was either developed or abandoned at about equal rates. Next, the steady growth of the forest and semi-natural area also changed the land cover. The enlargement of the artificial surface was the third observed trend of land cover changes. However, the pace of land cover changes on the Baltic coast is slightly slower than in the rest of Poland and the European average. The region is very diverse both in terms of land cover, types of land transformation, and the pace of change. Hence, the Polish national authorities classified the Baltic coast as an area of strategic intervention requiring additional action to achieve territorial cohesion and the goals of sustainable development.

TI  - NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY OF A MOUNTAIN FOREST ECOSYSTEM AS AFFECTED BY CLIMATE AND TOPOGRAPHY
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - Response of terrestrial ecosystems to changing climate has become an issue of central importance for land managers and policymakers. Climate extremes and trends have a strong control on productivity of semi-arid mountain ecosystems. Located in a transition zone from continental type climate to relatively mild Black Sea type climate in Turkey, the Ilgaz Mountains with their rich biodiversity, provide a unique opportunity to evaluate vulnerability of a typical semi-arid mountain ecosystem to climate change. Therefore, we evaluated spatio-temporal variation of annual net primary productivity (NPP) of llgaz Mountains predicted by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as affected by topography and climate between 2000 and 2010. The annual MODIS NPP ranged from 500 to 912 g.m(-1).y(-1). Elevation, slope aspect, and vegetation type were significantly correlated with MODIS NPP The MODIS NPP was highly sensitive to droughts, and the mean MODIS NPP generally decreased across the study pixels in the study period. The response of MODIS NPP to climate was highly site- and time-specific. Multiple interactions among climate, plant composition, and topography were the principal determinants of the temporal pattern as well as drought sensitivity of MODIS NPP to climate between 2000 and 2010. Quality control charts showed that MODIS NPP decreased sharply in 2003 and 2007 droughts. The results obtained in this study contributed to our understanding of the interactions among climate, topography, and vegetation composition in a typical mountain ecosystem.

AB  - The effect of surface temperature on the state of the vegetation in the forest of Polylepis spp and to relate it is the objective of this research. As methodology 9 satellite images of the Landsat 8 OLI / TIRS Sensor were used, evaluated using remote sensing, applying Pearson r correlation and statistical t student hypothesis. The following results were obtained: the relationships during the 9 months of the year 2018 - - 2019 between LST - NDVI r = 0.11, t = 0.29; LST - NDWI r = -0.43, t = 1.27; LST - SAVI r = 0.13, t = 0.34 and LST - MSI r = 0.56, t = 1.77; the average ratio of 9 images classified in Jenks Natural Breaks values between LST - NDVI r = 0.99, t = 47.12; LST - NDWI r = -0.98, t = 28.93; LST - SAVI r = -0.99, t = 65.39 and LST - MSI r = 0.99, t = 30.39; and the effect of "TVX" for NDVI (East: -0.0778 / 0.0549; West: 0.6434 / -0.0120), NDWI (West: -0.6128 / -0.0463; East: 0.3057 / 0.0474), SAVI (West: 0.4089 / 0.0232; East: -0.0073 / -0.0011) and MSI (East: 0.5565 / 0.1856; West: 1.3993 / 0.0362). In conclusion, it is confirmed that during the 9 months that the monitoring lasted, there was no statistical correlation and that on average of the 9 images classified in Jenks Natural Breaks there is a correlation; TVX confirmed the influence of surface temperature on the state of vegetation within the forest over time.

TI  - Impacts of Vegetation and Topography on Land Surface Temperature Variability over the Semi-Arid Mountain Cities of Saudi Arabia
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) can fully reflect the water-heat exchange cycle of the earth surface that is important for the study of environmental change. There is little research on LST in the semi-arid region of Abha-Khamis-Mushyet, which has a complex topography. The study used LST data, retrieved from ASTER data in semi-arid mountain areas and discussed its relationship with land use/land cover (LULC), topography and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The results showed that the LST was significantly influenced by altitude and corresponding LULC type. In the study area, during the summer season, extreme high-temperature zones were observed, possibly due to dense concrete surfaces. LST among different types of land use differed significantly, being the highest in exposed rocky areas and built-up land, and the lowest in dense vegetation. NDVI and LST spatial distributions showed opposite trends. The LST-NDVI feature space showed a unique ABC obtuse-angled triangle shape and showed an overall negative linear correlation. In brief, the LST could be retrieved well by the emissivity derived NDVI TES method, which relied on upwelling, downwelling, and transmittance. In addition, the LST of the semi-arid mountain areas was influenced by elevation, slope zenith angle, aspect and LULC, among which vegetation and elevation played a key role in the overall LST. This research provides a roadmap for land-use planning and environmental conservation in mountainous urban areas.

T2  - CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The accuracy of the staging, along with the reproductibility of intraoperative lymph car-tography, and lymph node biopsy in patients with malignant melanoma was unanimously validated in the last decade. This technique allows the discovery of lymph node micrometastses with the help of immunohistochemical methods. The goal of the present study is to present the experience of our clinic in identification and biopsy protocol of the lymph node.Methods: A year-long retrospective analysis was running between March 2019 - December 2019 con-cerning 57 patients with cutaneous melanoma on which detection and excisional biopsy of the lymph node was performed. The procedure was performed by the double method using vital dye and a ra-dio-active tracer. Demographic information was filed, as well as data on location of primary tumors, tumor histology, and radioactivity level.Results: The mean Breslow thickness of primary skin melanomas was 2.7 mm. At least one lymph node was identified in 56 of the 57 patients included in the study. Among those, 15 (26%) had at least one metastatic node. The mean number of excised lymph nodes per patient was 1.6.Conclusions: The cartography and biopsy of lymph nodes need the involvement of a complex multi-disciplinary team made of nuclear medicine, surgery, and anatomopathology specialists. This way one provides both a correct staging of the patient with melanoma and access to adjuvant innovative therapies, thus considerably improving the prognosis.

TI  - Water vapor variability in the Atacama Desert during the 20th century
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on integrated water vapor (IWV) which is the main source for precipitation, fog and dew formation in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. In order to study its long-term variability, a consistent meteorological record is needed. Here, we utilize the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' reanalysis ERA-20C which provides IWV among other atmospheric variables over the course of the entire 20th century (1900-2010). In this two fold study, we first present a validation of ERA-20C IWV for the Atacama and the bordering southeast Pacific region. Comparisons to satellite observations, i.e. the Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite data record and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer measurements, for overlapping time periods prove the suitability of ERA-20C to study IWV variability. Assessment of the observation feedback in ERA-20C reveals a higher uncertainty for the beginning of the 20th century when fewer observations are assimilated. Nevertheless, departures of the assimilated observations do not show a systematic bias in space or time supporting suitability of ERA-20C for long-term investigations. In the second part of the study, we describe the IWV variability over the course of the 20th century. Deviations from the long-term mean greater than 30% are found on an inter-annual time scale over the continental Atacama. Furthermore, we investigate potential drivers of the IWV variability such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. The relationship between the local IWV and these large scale indices depends on region and season. For instance, during austral summer, La Nina conditions yield overall greater IWV variability in the Atacama allowing both drier and even more pronounced wetter extremes than El Nino conditions.

TI  - Comparison of Different Cropland Classification Methods under Diversified Agroecological Conditions in the Zambezi River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Having updated knowledge of cropland extent is essential for crop monitoring and food security early warning. Previous research has proposed different methods and adopted various datasets for mapping cropland areas at regional to global scales. However, most approaches did not consider the characteristics of farming systems and apply the same classification method in different agroecological zones (AEZs). Furthermore, the acquisition of in situ samples for classification training remains challenging. To address these knowledge gaps and challenges, this study applied a zone-specific classification by comparing four classifiers (random forest, the support vector machine (SVM), the classification and regression tree (CART) and minimum distance) for cropland mapping over four different AEZs in the Zambezi River basin (ZRB). Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data and derived indices were used and synthesized to generate thirty-five layers for classification on the Google Earth Engine platform. Training samples were derived from three existing landcover datasets to minimize the cost of sample acquisitions over the large area. The final cropland map was generated at a 10 m resolution. The performance of the four classifiers and the viability of training samples were analysed. All classifiers presented higher accuracy in cool AEZs than in warm AEZs, which may be attributed to field size and lower confusion between cropland and grassland classes. This indicates that agricultural landscape may impact classification results regardless of the classifiers. Random forest was found to be the most stable and accurate classifier across different agricultural systems, with an overall accuracy of 84% and a kappa coefficient of 0.67. Samples extracted over the full agreement areas among existing datasets reduced uncertainty and provided reliable calibration sets as a replacement of costly in situ measurements. The methodology proposed by this study can be used to generate periodical high-resolution cropland maps in ZRB, which is helpful for the analysis of cropland extension and abandonment as well as intensity changes in response to the escalating population and food insecurity.

TI  - Survival outcomes in endometrial cancer patients having lymphadenectomy, sentinel node mapping followed by lymphadectomy and sentinel node mapping alone: Long-term results of a propensity-matched analysis
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Sentinel node mapping (SLNM) has replaced lymphadenectomy for staging surgery in apparent early-stage endometrial cancer (EC). Here, we evaluate long-term survival of three different approaches of nodal assessment in EC.Methods. This is a multi-institutional retrospective study evaluating long-term outcomes (at least 3 years) of EC patients having lymphadenectomy, SLNM followed by lymphadenectomy and SLNM alone. In order to reduce possible confounding factors we applied a propensity-matched algorithm. Survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models.Results. Applying a propensity score matching algorithm we selected 180 patients having SLNM (90 SLNM vs. 90 SLNM followed by lymphadenectomy). Additionally, a control group of 180 patients having lymphadenectomy was selected using the same criteria. Overall, 10% of patients were diagnosed with positive nodes. Low volume disease was observed in 16 cases (5 micrometastasis and 11 isolated tumor cells). Patients having SLNM followed by lymphadenectomy had a higher possibility to be diagnosed with a stage IIIC disease in comparison to lymphadenectomy alone (p=0.02); while we did not observe difference in the diagnostic value of SLNM followed by lymphadenectomy and SLNM (p=0.389). Median follow-up time was 69 months (range, 7-206). The survival analysis comparing the three techniques did not show statistical differences in terms of disease-free (p=0.570, log-rank test) and overall survival (p=0.911, log-rank test); Similarly, they did not impact on survival outcomes after stratification by low, intermediate and high risk patients.Conclusions. Our study highlighted that SLNM provides similar long-term oncologic outcomes than lymphadenectomy. Further evidence is warranted to assess the prognostic value of low-volume disease detected by ultrastaging in patients following SLNM. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Classification of Sea Ice Types in Sentinel-1 SAR Data Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new algorithm for classification of sea ice types on Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data using a convolutional neural network (CNN) is presented. The CNN is trained on reference ice charts produced by human experts and compared with an existing machine learning algorithm based on texture features and random forest classifier. The CNN is trained on two datasets in 2018 and 2020 for retrieval of four classes: ice free, young ice, first-year ice and old ice. The accuracy of our classification is 90.5% for the 2018-dataset and 91.6% for the 2020-dataset. The uncertainty is a bit higher for young ice (85%/76% accuracy in 2018/2020) and first-year ice (86%/84% accuracy in 2018/2020). Our algorithm outperforms the existing random forest product for each ice type. It has also proved to be more efficient in computing time and less sensitive to the noise in SAR data. The code is publicly available.

TI  - Evaluation of the TRMM Product for Monitoring Drought over Paraiba State, Northeastern Brazil: A Statistical Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural phenomenon that originates from the absence of precipitation over a certain period and is capable of causing damage to societal development. With the advent of orbital remote sensing, rainfall estimates from satellites have appeared as viable alternatives to monitor natural hazards in ungauged basins and complex areas of the world; however, the accuracies of these orbital products still need to be verified. Thus, this work aims to evaluate the performance of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite rainfall estimates in monitoring the spatiotemporal behavior of droughts at multiple temporal scales over Paraiba State based on the standardized precipitation index (SPI) over 20 years (1998-2017). For this purpose, rainfall data from 78 rain gauges and 187 equally spaced TRMM cell grids throughout the region are used, and accuracy analyses are performed at the single-gauge level and in four mesoregions at eight different time scales based on 11 statistical metrics calculations divided into three different categories. The results show that in the mesoregions close to the coast, the satellite-based product is less accurate in capturing the drought behavior regardless of the evaluated statistical metrics. At the temporal scale, the TRMM is more accurate in identifying the pattern of medium-term droughts; however, there is considerable spatial variation in the accuracy of the product depending on the performance index. Therefore, it is concluded that rainfall estimates from the TRMM satellite are a valuable source of data to identify drought behavior in a large part of Paraiba State at different time scales, and further multidisciplinary studies should be conducted to monitor these phenomena more accurately based on satellite data.

TI  - Macadamia Orchard Planting Year and Area Estimation at a National Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of tree crop orchard age and historical crop area are important to develop yield prediction algorithms, and facilitate improving accuracy in ongoing crop forecasts. This is particularly relevant for the increasingly productive macadamia industry in Australia, where knowledge of tree age, as well as total planted area, are important predictors of productivity, and the area devoted to macadamia orchards is rapidly increasing. We developed a technique to aggregate more than 30 years of historical imagery, generate summary tables from the data, and search multiple combinations of parameters to find the most accurate planting year prediction algorithm. This made use of known planting dates of more than 90 macadamia blocks spread across multiple growing regions. The selected algorithm achieved a planting year mean absolute error of 1.7 years. The algorithm was then applied to all macadamia features in east Australia, as defined in an recent Australian tree crops map, to determine the area planted per year and the total cumulative area of macadamia orchards in Australia. The area estimates were refined by improving the resolution of the mapped macadamia features, by removing non-productive areas based on an optimal vegetation index threshold.

TI  - Space dynamics of the landscape of the State Park of Jalapao (TO) from 2000 to 2015
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape modification and habitat fragmentation have become major research topics. They are considered serious threats to biodiversity. The disturbance history of the area of Jalapao State Park (Parque Estadual do Jalapao - PEJ) was analysed given its characteristic as a Conservation Unit (CU) of integral protection inserted into the Cerrado biome. Thus, the objective of this research is to update the map of land use and cover of this CU and analyse the metrics that quantify habitat connectivity and fragmentation in the landscape ecologyfor 2015 based on the land use map for 2000. In order to plot the PEJ's 2015 map of land use, we used the scene 221/67 (orbit/point) of August 8, 2015, from the Landsat 8 satellite, OLI sensor, since it covered the entire study area and did not present cloud cover. In the digital image processing, radiometric correction, pre-classification, and association of classes of soil use were performed. Subsequently, a supervised classification was performed through visual interpretation. To verify map accuracy, the Kappa coefficient was calculated. Its value was 0.92. From the updated map, calculations of landscape ecology indexes were performed considering area, size, shape, border, and proximity of fragments. The procedures were performed using the software GIS ArcGIS 10.4 and the free extension Patch Analyst 5.2. Based on the maps of land use and cover, and indexes of landscape ecology, it is possible to verify that there were changes in the landscape. As for metrics, it can be concluded that the CU is fragmented (564 fragments) and has a high spatial heterogeneity, a complex form, and an irregular shape due to values of MPS, PSCoV and MSI.

TI  - A Probabilistic Assessment of Soil Erosion Susceptibility in a Head Catchment of the Jemma Basin, Ethiopian Highlands
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion represents one of the most important global issues with serious effects on agriculture and water quality, especially in developing countries, such as Ethiopia, where rapid population growth and climatic changes affect widely mountainous areas. The Meskay catchment is a head catchment of the Jemma Basin draining into the Blue Nile (Central Ethiopia) and is characterized by high relief energy. Thus, it is exposed to high degradation dynamics, especially in the lower parts of the catchment. In this study, we aim at the geomorphological assessment of soil erosion susceptibilities. First, a geomorphological map was generated based on remote sensing observations. In particular, we mapped three categories of landforms related to (i) sheet erosion, (ii) gully erosion, and (iii) badlands using a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM). The map was validated by a detailed field survey. Subsequently, we used the three categories as dependent variables in a probabilistic modelling approach to derive the spatial distribution of the specific process susceptibilities. In this study we applied the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt). The independent variables were derived from a set of spatial attributes describing the lithology, terrain, and land cover based on remote sensing data and DEMs. As a result, we produced three separate susceptibility maps for sheet and gully erosion as well as badlands. The resulting susceptibility maps showed good to excellent prediction performance. Moreover, to explore the mutual overlap of the three susceptibility maps, we generated a combined map as a color composite where each color represents one component of water erosion. The latter map yields useful information for land-use managers and planning purposes.

TI  - Fire risk perpetuates poverty and fire use among Amazonian smallholders
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires exacerbate carbon emissions, threaten biodiversity and cause welfare losses to local populations. Most fires accidentally ignite from mismanaged swidden and pasture fires. We provide evidence that fire risk in the Brazilian Amazon, the world's largest remaining tropical forest, perpetuates low yield and environmentally degrading agricultural activities. Using a combination of household interviews and remotely sensed data on fire occurrence in Eastern Amazon municipalities of Paragominas and Santarem, we show that smallholders in consolidated farm-forest frontier regions are locked into a vicious cycle that inhibits their adoption of fire-free practices. Households that invest in more capital-intensive fire-free agricultural technologies experience greater revenue losses from escaped fires than non-fire users. Changes in revenues are as sensitive to these fire impacts as they are to changes in physical capital investments. To overcome this fire-poverty trap, a "big push" of coordinated local incentives is needed. Policies mitigating fire risk may achieve a triple-win that reduces greenhouse gas emissions, forest degradation, and fosters inclusive economic development.

TI  - Assessment of PCDD/Fs, dioxin-like PCBs and PBDEs in Mediterranean striped dolphins
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Bio-accumulation of high levels of persistent organic pollutants represent a serious conservation concern for Mediterranean marine odontocetes. In this study, blubber samples from 10 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) stranded along the Italian coasts during 2015-2016 were analyzed. All specimens showed dl-PCBs > PBDEs >> PCDD/Fs. Median concentrations were 1820 ng/g l.w., 456 ng/g l.w. and 23.9 pg/g l.w., respectively. dl-PCBs accounted for 93.3% of total TEQs. PBDE concentrations suggest that the Mediterranean basin may be considered a hotspot for organobromine compounds. OCDD did not represent the greatest contributor to PCDD/Fs profile, most likely due to a change in dioxin environmental sources in the last two-three decades. Despite international regulations, the present study emphasized that POP exposure levels in Mediterranean striped dolphins have not declined significantly in recent years. Toxicological and risk assessment studies on this sentinel species may provide an early indication of potential adverse health effects on Mediterranean ecosystems.

TI  - Semi-Automatization of Support Vector Machines to Map Lithium (Li) Bearing Pegmatites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown great performance in geological remote sensing applications. The study area of this work was the Fregeneda-Almendra region (Spain-Portugal) where the support vector machine (SVM) was employed. Lithium (Li)-pegmatite exploration using satellite data presents some challenges since pegmatites are, by nature, small, narrow bodies. Consequently, the following objectives were defined: (i) train several SVM's on Sentinel-2 images with different parameters to find the optimal model; (ii) assess the impact of imbalanced data; (iii) develop a successful methodological approach to delineate target areas for Li-exploration. Parameter optimization and model evaluation was accomplished by a two-staged grid-search with cross-validation. Several new methodological advances were proposed, including a region of interest (ROI)-based splitting strategy to create the training and test subsets, a semi-automatization of the classification process, and the application of a more innovative and adequate metric score to choose the best model. The proposed methodology obtained good results, identifying known Li-pegmatite occurrences as well as other target areas for Li-exploration. Also, the results showed that the class imbalance had a negative impact on the SVM performance since known Li-pegmatite occurrences were not identified. The potentials and limitations of the methodology proposed are highlighted and its applicability to other case studies is discussed.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Distribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Pollution over Northeastern Mexico: Application of MERRA-2 Reanalysis Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol and meteorological remote sensing data could be used to assess the distribution of urban and regional fine particulate matter (PM2.5), especially in locations where there are few or no ground-based observations, such as Latin America. The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application, version 2 (MERRA-2) aerosol components to represent PM2.5 ground concentrations and to develop and validate an ensemble neural network (ENN) model that uses MERRA-2 aerosol and meteorology products to estimate the monthly average of PM2.5 ground concentrations in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA), which is the main urban area in Northeastern Mexico (NEM). The project involves the application of the ENN model to a regional domain that includes not only the MMA but also other municipalities in NEM in the period from January 2010 to December 2014. Aerosol optical depth (AOD), temperature, relative humidity, dust PM2.5, sea salt PM2.5, black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), and sulfate (SO42-) reanalysis data were identified as factors that significantly influenced PM2.5 concentrations. The ENN estimated a PM2.5 monthly mean of 25.62 mu g m(-3)during the entire period. The results of the comparison between the ENN and ground measurements were as follows: correlation coefficient R similar to 0.90; root mean square error = 1.81 mu g m(-3); mean absolute error = 1.31 mu g m(-3). Overall, the PM2.5 levels were higher in winter and spring. The highest PM2.5 levels were located in the MMA, which is the major source of air pollution throughout this area. The estimated data indicated that PM2.5 was not distributed uniformly throughout the region but varied both spatially and temporally. These results led to the conclusion that the magnitude of air pollution varies among seasons and regions, and it is correlated with meteorological factors. The methodology developed in this study could be used to identify new monitoring sites and address information gaps.

AB  - We track a remarkably bright and persistent auroral cusp spot emission in the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere polar cap, well inside the main auroral oval, for approximately 11 hr on 16 and 17 June 2012. The auroral emissions are presented in both the Lyman-alpha and Lyman-Birge-Hopfield bands, as observed by the Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager on board two of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Programme spacecraft, and supported by detections of precipitating particles by the same spacecraft. The auroral observations are accompanied by patterns of field aligned currents, obtained from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment, along with ionospheric convection patterns from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network. These data provide unprecedented coverage of a cusp spot, unusually seen in both electron and proton aurora. The location and movement of the auroral emissions, current systems, and ionospheric convection patterns are extremely distorted under the northward toY-component-dominated interplanetary magnetic field. The cusp spot emission region is associated with the sunward flow region of the ionosphere. Ion dispersion signatures are detected on traversal of the region of brightest proton auroral emissions. Proton-excited Lyman-alpha emissions are most evident following impulses of high solar wind density. The auroral emissions, field-aligned current patterns, and ionospheric convection are consistent with a model of a compressed magnetosphere under strongly northward interplanetary magnetic field, following an impact of an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection and associated magnetic cloud at the magnetopause, inducing high-latitude lobe reconnection that progresses increasingly tailward during the presented interval.

TI  - Classification of Oil Slicks and Look-Alike Slicks: A Linear Discriminant Analysis of Microwave, Infrared, and Optical Satellite Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We classify low-backscatter regions observed in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements of the surface of the ocean as either oil slicks or look-alike slicks (radar false targets). Our proposed classification algorithm is based on Linear Discriminant Analyses (LDAs) of RADARSAT-1 measurements (402 scenes off the southeast coast of Brazil from July 2001 to June 2003) and Meteorological-Oceanographic (MetOc) data from other earth observation sensors: Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT). Oil slicks are sea-surface expressions of exploration and production oil, ship- and orphan-spills. False targets are associated with environmental phenomena, such as biogenic films, algal blooms, upwelling, low wind, or rain cells. Both categories have been interpreted by domain-experts: mineral oil (n=350; 45.5%) and petroleum free (n=419; 54.5%). We explore nine size variables (area, perimeter, etc.) and three types of MetOc information (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, and wind speed) that describe the 769 samples analyzed. Seven attribute-domain combinations are tested with three non-linear transformations (none, cube root, log(10)), with and without MetOc, adding to 39 attribute subdivisions. Classification accuracies are independent of data transformation and improve when selected size attributes are combined with MetOc, leading to overall accuracies of similar to 80% and sound levels of sensitivity (similar to 90%), specificity (similar to 80%), positive (similar to 80%) and negative (similar to 90%) predictive values. The effectiveness of this data-driven attempt supports further commercial or academic implementation of our LDA algorithm.

TI  - AEROSOL CLASSIFICATION FOR TUCUMAN AERONET STATION, ARGENTINA
T2  - ANALES AFA
M3  - Article
AB  - On November 15th, 2017, a new sunphotometer was installed for sensing and studying aerosols at National Meteorological Service headquarters in the City of Tucuman (26,787 degrees S; 65,207 degrees O), and was integrated to the AERONET / NASA network. The north-central region of the country is mostly affected by both local and transported biomass burning events. In this work, a statistical study is carried out with the first available measurements done between November 2017 and December 2018. This analysis shows the averaged values of the aerosol optical properties, the Angstrom coefficient and the aerosol type. In addition, an aerosol transport event during the month of September 2018 is studied, highlighting high values of aerosol optical thickness of 0.45 at 440 nm and an Angstrom coefficient of 1.95, indicating the presence of smoke in the local atmosphere.

TI  - Combining Numerical Weather Predictions and Satellite Data for PV Energy Nowcasting
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing presence of photovoltaic (PV) generation in the energy mix demands improved forecasting tools which can be updated in an almost continuous basis. Satellite-based information lends itself naturally to this purpose and here it is used to nowcast hourly PV energy production for horizons up to six hours over Peninsular Spain and two islands, Majorca in the Mediterranean Sea and Tenerife in the Atlantic Ocean. This paper compares a single model-based on same-day numerical weather prediction (NWP) with hourly refreshed models which either only use satellite-based measurements or which combine both NWP same-day forecasts and satellite data. As shown in the experiments, the satellite-NWP combination gives very good nowcasting results, clearly superior to those achievable separately by either approach.

TI  - Sensitivity and uncertainty quantification for the ECOSTRESS evapotranspiration algorithm - DisALEXI
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a measure of plant water use that is utilized regionally for drought detection and monitoring, and locally for agricultural water resource management. Understanding the uncertainty associated with this measurement is vital for science predictions and analysis and for water resource management decision making. In this manuscript, the uncertainty in disaggregated Atmosphere-Land Exchange (disALEXI) is quantified; disALEXI is an ET algorithm that utilizes land surface temperature (LST) derived from the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), as well ancillary inputs for landcover, elevation, vegetation parameters, and meteorological inputs. Since each of these inputs has an associated, and potentially unknown, uncertainty, in this study a Monte Carlo simulation based on a spatial statistical model is used to determine the algorithm's sensitivity to each of its inputs, and to quantify the probability distribution of algorithm outputs. Analysis shows that algorithm is most sensitive to LST (the input derived from ECOSTRESS). Significantly, the output uncertainty distribution is non-Gaussian, due to the non-linear nature of the algorithm. This means that ET uncertainty cannot be prescribed by accuracy and precision alone. Here, uncertainty was represented using five quantiles of the output distribution. The distribution was consistent across five different datasets (mean offset is 0.01 mm/day, and 95% of the data is contained within 0.3 mm/day). An additional two datasets with low ET, showed higher uncertainty (95% of the data is within 1 mm/day), and a positive bias (i.e., ET was overestimated by an average of 0.12 mm/day when ET was low).

TI  - Small Reservoirs, Landscape Changes and Water Quality in Sub-Saharan West Africa
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Small reservoirs (SRs) are essential water storage infrastructures for rural populations of Sub-Saharan West Africa. In recent years, rapid population increase has resulted in unprecedented land use and land cover (LULC) changes. Our study documents the impacts of such changes on the water quality of SRs in Burkina Faso. Multi-temporal Landsat images were analyzed to determine LULC evolutions at various scales between 2002 and 2014. Population densities were calculated from downloaded 2014 population data. In situ water samples collected in 2004/5 and 2014 from selected SRs were analyzed for Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) loads, an integrative proxy for water quality. The expansion of crop and artificial areas at the expense of natural covers controlled LULC changes over the period. We found a very significant correlation between SPM loads and population densities calculated at a watershed scale. A general increase between the two sampling dates in the inorganic component of SPM loads, concomitant with a clear expansion of cropland areas at a local scale, was evidenced. Results of the study suggest that two complementary but independent indicators (i.e., LULC changes within 5-km buffer areas around SRs and demographic changes at watershed scale), relevantly reflected the nature and intensity of overall pressures exerted by humans on their environment, and locally on aquatic ecosystems. Recommendations related to the re-greening of peripheral areas around SRs in order to protect water bodies are suggested.

TI  - TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub>Tropospheric Column Data: Regridding to 1 km Grid-Resolution and Assessment of their Consistency with In Situ Surface Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a regridding procedure applied to the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) tropospheric column data, derived from the Copernicus Sentinel 5 Precursor Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (S5P/TROPOMI). The regridding has been performed to provide a better comparison with punctual surface observations. It will be demonstrated that TROPOMI NO(2)tropospheric column data show improved consistency with in situ surface measurements once the satellite retrievals are scaled to 1 km spatial sampling. A geostatistical technique, i.e., the ordinary kriging, has been applied to improve the spatial distribution of Level 2 TROPOMI NO(2)data, which is originally sparse and uneven because of gaps introduced by clouds, to a final spatial, regular, sampling of 1 km x 1 km. The analysis has been performed for two study areas, one in the North and the other in the South of Italy, and for May 2018-April 2020, which also covers the period January 2020-April 2020 of COVID-19 diffusion over the Po Valley. The higher spatial sampling NO(2)dataset indicated as Level 3 data, allowed us to explore spatial and seasonal data variability, obtaining better information on NO(2)sources. In this respect, it will be shown that NO(2)concentrations in March 2020 have likely decreased as a consequence of the lockdown because of COVID-19, although the far warmest winter season ever recorded over Europe in 2020 has favored a general NO(2)decrease in comparison to the 2019 winter. Moreover, the comparison between NO(2)concentrations related to weekdays and weekend days allowed us to show the strong correlation of NO(2)emissions with traffic and industrial activities. To assess the quality and capability of TROPOMI NO(2)observations, we have studied their relationship and correlation with in situ NO(2)concentrations measured at air quality monitoring stations. We have found that the correlation increases when we pass from Level 2 to Level 3 data, showing the importance of regridding the satellite data. In particular, correlation coefficients of Level 3 data, which range between 0.50-0.90 have been found with higher correlation applying to urban, polluted locations and/or cities.

TI  - HIV-1 genetic diversity and recombinant forms among men who have sex with men at a sentinel surveillance site in Xi'an City, China
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - HIV-1 genetic distribution and recombinant patterns are important in understanding the HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM). In this study, 83 HIV-positive MSM infections were confirmed at a sentinel surveillance site in Xi'an city, China in 2018. HIV-1 genotypes were determined by phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 gag, pol and env gene fragments, including CRF07_BC (51.8%), CRF01_AE (30.1%), subtype B (3.6%), CRF55_01B (3.6%), CRF104_0107 (1.2%) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) (9.6%). Transmitted drug resistance mutations were detected in 2.4% (2/82) of HIV-infected MSM individuals. The phylogenetic analyses of near full-length genome (NFLG) of HIV-1 URFs were performed. A new circulating recombinant form (CRF), designated as CRF104_0107, was found in three epidemiologically unlinked individuals in Shaanxi province, China. The CRF104_0107 is composed of genomes CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC, with six recombinant breakpoints in the gag, pol, vif and vpr genes. This second-generation CRF has a breakpoint (HXB2 nt 3011) in common with CRF07_BC. The emergence of novel CRF and multiple URFs reflected HIV-1 genetic complexity among the local key populations in Xi'an city, China.

TI  - Applying career human agency theory to practice
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CAREER DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article elaborates the emerging career human agency theory and its applicability to career psychology practice. UsingBandura'shuman agency theory as a foundation, career human agency theory is a meta-theory that integrates key tenets from major theories in vocational and career psychology. It presents an endeavour of theoretical integration to conceive and understand career issues and vocational behaviours. The article provides a brief overview of career human agency theory, indicating its postmodern constructivist and constructionist worldview in conceptualizing life-career phenomena, while integrating life and career experiences into a dynamic and coherent whole. To this end, the four pillar theoretical principles and constructs of career human agency theory are reviewed, namely, career intentionality, career forethought, career self-reactiveness, and career self-reflectiveness. Furthermore, the article considers and explains the usefulness of the four constructs as they are applied to professional helping and self-helping processes that improve and enhance the vocational wellness of individuals, connecting career human agency theory to practice. In doing so, the article concludes with a case study illustration to demonstrate how these career human agency theory constructs and their related tenets and ideas can inform and guide career development practice and career counselling interventions, utilizing and strengthening agentic functioning in individuals' worklife wellbeing.

TI  - "Seeds for a New Life": Modernity and the Pacific Turn in the Progressive Era
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GILDED AGE AND PROGRESSIVE ERA
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the colonial era, the ideological and cultural usefulness of Asia has changed with evolving American needs. This article argues that the Progressive Era turn toward the Pacific world marked a new epoch and mode of transnational interchange as a diverse array of Americans traveled to China and Japan. Encounters with Asianness in situ would lead to a reinvention of the U.S. worldview in the late nineteenth century. The question at hand for certain Americans was how to become "modern," to germinate "seeds for a new life" that would ensure the prosperity and well-being of the United States amidst momentous global changes. Instead of being antimodernist, the fetishization of Asia served as a way to rein in and define modernity for American purposes. In the process, modernist Orientalism became a framework for imagining China and Japan and their cultural practices. Buddhism, in particular, was reconceptualized as a hybrid entity that seemed to be emblematic of the dawn of a new era. Ultimately, the flow of ideas and peoples between Asia and the United States enabled Americans to construct a global "modern" identity for themselves and to carve out a prominent role for the nation within the international community.

TI  - A Satellite Observation Data Transmission Scheduling Algorithm Oriented to Data Topics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The scheduling of Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) data transmission is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. With the development of remote sensing applications, a new special requirement named data transmission oriented to topics has appeared. It supposes that the data obtained from each observation activity by satellites belong to certain observation data topics, and every observation data topic has completeness and timeliness requirements. Unless all of the observation data belonging to one topic has been transmitted to the ground before the expected time, the value of the observation data will be decayed sharply and only a part of the rewards (or even no reward) for the data transmission will be obtained. Current researches do not meet the new data topic transmission requirements well. Based on the characteristics of the problem, a mathematic scheduling model is established, and a novel hybrid scheduling algorithm based on evolutionary computation is proposed. In order to further enhance the performance and speed up the convergence process of our algorithm, a domain-knowledge-based mutation operator is designed. Quantitative experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective to solve the satellite observation data topic transmission scheduling problem than that of the state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Distribution of Major Aerosol Types over China Based on MODIS Products between 2008 and 2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of aerosol-type distribution is critical to the evaluation of aerosol-climate effects. However, research on aerosol-type distribution covering all is limited. This study characterized the spatiotemporal distribution of major aerosol types over China by using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products from 2008 to 2017. Two aerosol-type classification methods were combined to achieve this goal. One was for relatively high aerosol load (AOD >= 0.2) using aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol relative optical depth (AROD) and the other was for low aerosol load (AOD < 0.2) using land use and population density information, which assumed that aerosols are closely related to local emissions. Results showed that the dominant aerosol-type distribution has a distinct spatial and temporal pattern. In western China, background aerosols (mainly dust/desert dust and continent aerosol) dominate with a combined occurrence ratio over 70% and they have slight variations on seasonal scale. While in eastern China, the dominant aerosols show strong seasonal variations. Spatially, mixed aerosols dominate most parts of eastern China in spring due to the influence of long-range transported dust from Taklamakan and Gobi desert and urban/industry aerosols take place in summer due to strong photochemical reactions. Temporally, mixed and urban/industry aerosols co-dominate eastern China.

TI  - Evaluation and Normalization of Topographic Effects on Vegetation Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalization of topographic effects on vegetation indices (VIs) is a prerequisite for their proper use in mountainous areas. We assessed the topographic effects on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and the near-infrared reflectance of terrestrial vegetation (NIRv) calculated from Sentinel-2. The evaluation was based on two criteria: the correlation with local illumination condition and the dependence on aspect. Results show that topographic effects can be neglected for the NDVI, while they heavily influence the SAVI, EVI, and NIRv: the local illumination condition explains 19.85%, 25.37%, and 26.69% of the variation of the SAVI, EVI, and NIRv, respectively, and the coefficients of variation across different aspects are, respectively, 8.13%, 10.46%, and 14.07%. We demonstrated the applicability of existing correction methods, including statistical-empirical (SE), sun-canopy-sensor with C-correction (SCS + C), and path length correction (PLC), dedicatedly designed for reflectance, to normalize topographic effects on VIs. Our study will benefit vegetation monitoring with VIs over mountainous areas.

TI  - Sensitivity of 89-190-GHz Microwave Observations to Ice Particle Scattering
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The sensitivity of microwave brightness temperatures (TBs) to hydrometeors at frequencies between 89 and 190 GHz is investigated by comparing Fengyun-3C(FY-3C) Microwave Humidity Sounder-2 (MWHS-2) measurements with radar reflectivity profiles and retrieved products from the Global Precipitation Measurement mission's Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). Scattering-induced TB depressions (Delta TBs), calculated by subtracting simulated cloud-free TBs from bias-corrected observed TBs for each channel, are compared with DPR-retrieved hydrometeor water path (HWP) and vertically integrated radar reflectivity Z(INT). We also account for the number of hydrometeors actually visible in each MWHS-2 channel by weighting HWP with the channel's cloud-free gas transmission profile and the observation slant path. We denote these transmission-weighted, slant-path-integrated quantities with a superscript asterisk (e.g., HWP*). The so-derived linear sensitivity of Delta TB with respect to HWP* increases with frequency roughly to the power of 1.78. A retrieved HWP* of 1 kg m(-2) at 89 GHz on average corresponds to a decrease in observed TB, relative to a cloud-free background, of 11 K. At 183 GHz, the decrease is about 34-53K. We perform a similar analysis using the vertically integrated, transmission-weighted slant-path radar reflectivity Z(INT)* and find that Delta TB also decreases approximately linearly with (Z(INT)*)(0.58). The exponent of 0.58 corresponds to the one we find in the purely DPR-retrieval- based Z(INT)-HWP relation. The observed sensitivities of Delta TB with respect to Z(INT)* and HWP* allow for the validation of hydrometeor scattering models.

AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is an essential climate variable (ECV) widely used for various ecological and climate models. However, all the current FAPAR satellite products correspond to instantaneous FAPAR values acquired at the satellite transit time only, which cannot represent the variations in photosynthetic processes over the diurnal period. Most studies have directly used the instantaneous FAPAR as a reasonable approximation of the daily integrated value. However, clearly, FAPAR varies a lot according to the weather conditions and amount of incoming radiation. In this paper, a temporal upscaling method based on the cosine of the solar zenith angle (SZA) at local noon (cos(SZA(noon))) is proposed for converting instantaneous FAPAR to daily integrated FAPAR. First, the diurnal variations in FAPAR were investigated using PROSAIL (a model of Leaf Optical Properties Spectra (PROSPECT) integrating a canopy radiative transfer model (Scattering from Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves, SAIL)) simulations with different leaf area index (LAI) values corresponding to different latitudes. It was found that the instantaneous black sky FAPAR at 09:30 AM provided a good approximation for the daily integrated black sky FAPAR; this gave the highest correlation (R-2 = 0.995) and lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.013) among the instantaneous black sky FAPAR values observed at different times. Secondly, the difference between the instantaneous black sky FAPAR values acquired at different times and the daily integrated black sky FAPAR was analyzed; this could be accurately modelled using the cosine value of solar zenith angle at local noon (cos(SZA(noon))) for a given vegetation scene. Therefore, a temporal upscaling method for typical satellite products was proposed using a cos(SZA)-based upscaling model. Finally, the proposed cos(SZA)-based upscaling model was validated using both the PROSAIL simulated data and the field measurements. The validated results indicated that the upscaled daily black sky FAPAR was highly consistent with the daily integrated black sky FAPAR, giving very high mean R-2 values (0.998, 0.972), low RMSEs (0.007, 0.014), and low rMAEs (0.596%, 1.378%) for the simulations and the field measurements, respectively. Consequently, the cos(SZA)-based method performs well for upscaling the instantaneous black sky FAPAR to its daily value, which is a simple but extremely important approach for satellite remote sensing applications related to FAPAR.

TI  - Performance study of affine transformation and the advanced clear-sky model to improve intra-day solar forecasts
T2  - JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar irradiance forecasting is one of the most efficient methods to handle the potential problems caused by the large and frequent photovoltaic fluctuations. For the satellite-based forecasting method, the atmospheric attenuation is paid lesser attention than other parts (notably the cloud effects). This study aims to explore the possibility of improving irradiance forecasting by using an advanced clear-sky model (i.e., the McClear model) and the running-window based affine transformation with local measurements. The McClear model notably aims at accounting for aerosol and water vapor intraday variabilities, in contrast with the European solar radiation atlas (ESRA) model based on climatological monthly means of Linke turbidity. The affine transformation with a running window of few days in the sliding past can serve as a correction procedure and has the potential to lower the impacts by inaccurate atmospheric estimation. Irradiance forecasting is carried out at lead times from 15 min to 3 h at an interval of 15 min, based on China's second-generation geostationary satellite Fengyun-4A. The measure-oriented and distribution-oriented approaches are used for a comprehensive verification. The results show that without affine transformation, the forecasting model with the McClear model outperforms that with the ESRA model, due to better estimations of atmospheric attenuation. On the other hand, affine transformation significantly improves the forecasting models. Overestimations still exist but are significantly reduced to the range of 2%-5.5%. After affine transformation, the forecasting models achieve very close performances no matter which clear-sky model is implemented, except that forecasts with the McClear model are much better calibrated at a high irradiance level (i.e., 900 W/m(2)).

TI  - Construct Channel Network Topology From Remote Sensing Images by Morphology and Graph Analysis
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Channel network topology plays an important role in hydrological analysis. This letter proposes an innovative method to construct it based only on remote sensing images. The method uses spectral water indexes and mask of large lakes and ocean areas derived from remote sensing data to generate the map of channels. Then, a morphological thinning algorithm is introduced to extract the initial skeleton of channels. Moreover, an iterative pruning process based on a graph algorithm is proposed to simplify the initial skeleton. Finally, according to the simplified skeleton and its adjacency matrix, a new connectivity graph can be constructed to describe the channel network topology. The proposed method can construct complete skeleton structure and the topology of channels with good connectivity in an automatic way. The output will facilitate detailed hydrological modeling and further applications.

TI  - A New Cross-Fusion Method to Automatically Determine the Optimal Input Image Pairs for NDVI Spatiotemporal Data Fusion
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal data fusion is a methodology to generate images with both high spatial and temporal resolution. Most spatiotemporal data fusion methods generate the fused image at a prediction date based on pairs of input images from other dates. The performance of spatiotemporal data fusion is greatly affected by the selection of the input image pair. There are two criteria for selecting the input image pair: the "similarity" criterion, in which the image at the base date should be as similar as possible to that at the prediction date, and the "consistency" criterion, in which the coarse and fine images at the base date should be consistent in terms of their radiometric characteristics and imaging geometry. Unfortunately, the "consistency" criterion has not been quantitatively considered by previous selection strategies. We thus develop a novel method (called "cross-fusion") to address the issue of the determination of the base image pair. The new method first chooses several candidate input image pairs according to the "similarity" criterion and then takes the "consistency" criterion into account by employing all of the candidate input image pairs to implement spatiotemporal data fusion between them. We applied the new method to MODIS-Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data fusion. The results show that the cross-fusion method performs better than four other selection strategies, with lower average absolute difference (AAD) values and higher correlation coefficients in various vegetated regions including a deciduous forest in Northeast China, an evergreen forest in South China, cropland in North China Plain, and grassland in the Tibetan Plateau. We simulated scenarios for the inconsistency between MODIS and Landsat data and found that the simulated inconsistency is successfully quantified by the new method. In addition, the cross-fusion method is less affected by cloud omission errors. The fused NDVI time-series data generated by the new method tracked various vegetation growth trajectories better than previous selection strategies. We expect that the cross-fusion method can advance practical applications of spatiotemporal data fusion technology.

TI  - Leaf Area Index Estimation Algorithm for GF-5 Hyperspectral Data Based on Different Feature Selection and Machine Learning Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an essential vegetation parameter that represents the light energy utilization and vegetation canopy structure. As the only in-operation hyperspectral satellite launched by China, GF-5 is potentially useful for accurate LAI estimation. However, there is no research focus on evaluating GF-5 data for LAI estimation. Hyperspectral remote sensing data contains abundant information about the reflective characteristics of vegetation canopies, but these abound data also easily result in a dimensionality curse. Therefore, feature selection (FS) is necessary to reduce data redundancy to achieve more reliable estimations. Currently, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been widely used for FS. Moreover, the same ML algorithm is usually conducted for both FS and regression in LAI estimation. However, no evidence suggests that this is the optimal solution. Therefore, this study focuses on evaluating the capacity of GF-5 spectral reflectance for estimating LAI and the performances of different combination of FS and ML algorithms. Firstly, the PROSAIL model, which coupled leaf optical properties model PROSPECT and the scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves (SAIL) model, was used to generate simulated GF-5 reflectance data under different vegetation and soil conditions, and then three FS methods, including random forest (RF), K-means clustering (K-means) and mean impact value (MIV), and three ML algorithms, including random forest regression (RFR), back propagation neural network (BPNN) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) were used to develop nine LAI estimation models. The FS process was conducted twice using different strategies: Firstly, three FS methods were conducted to search the lowest dimension number, which maintained the estimation accuracy of all bands. Then, the sequential backward selection (SBS) method was used to eliminate the bands having minimal impact on LAI estimation accuracy. Finally, three best estimation models were selected and evaluated using reference LAI. The results showed that although the RF_RFR model (RF used for feature selection and RFR used for regression) achieved reliable LAI estimates (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.828, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.839), the poor performance (R-2= 0.763, RMSE = 0.987) of the MIV_BPNN model (MIV used for feature selection and BPNN used for regression) suggested using feature selection and regression conducted by the same ML algorithm could not always ensure an optimal estimation. Moreover, RF selection preserved the most informative bands for LAI estimation so that each ML regression method could achieve satisfactory estimation results. Finally, the results indicated that the RF_KNN model (RF used as feature selection and KNN used for regression) with seven GF-5 spectral band reflectance achieved the better estimation results than others when validated by simulated data (R-2= 0.834, RMSE = 0.824) and actual reference LAI (R-2= 0.659, RMSE = 0.697).

TI  - Two-decade variations of fresh submarine groundwater discharge to Tolo Harbour and their ecological significance by coupled remote sensing and radon-222 model
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) comprises an insignificant proportion of the global hydrologic cycle, it contributes significantly to chemical fluxes into the coastal waters due to concentrated constituents in coastal groundwater. Large nutrient loadings derived from SGD can lead to a series of environmental and ecological problems such as algal blooms, resulting in water discoloration, severe dissolved oxygen depletion, and eventually beach closures and massive fish kills. Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between algal blooms and SGD obtained from direct measurement with seepage meters or from geo-tracer (i.e., radon and radium) based models; these traditional methods are time-consuming, laborious and point monitoring, and can hardly achieve a high spatiotemporal resolution SGD estimation, which is vital in revealing the effects of SGD to algal blooms over a long period. Alternatively, remote sensing methods for high spatiotemporal resolution SGD localization and quantification are applicable and effective. The temperature difference or anomaly between groundwater and coastal water extracted from satellite thermal images can be used as the indicator to localize and detect SGD especially its fresh component (or fresh SGD). In this study, multi-year (2005, 2011 and 2018) radon samples in Tolo Harbour were used to train regression models between in-situ radon (Rn) activity and the temperature anomaly by Landsat satellite thermal images. The models were used to estimate two-decade variations of fresh SGD in Tolo Harbour. The synergistic analysis between the time series of fresh SGD derived from regression models and high spatiotemporal resolution ecological metrics (chlorophyll-a, algal cell counts, and E.coli) leads to the findings that the increase of the fresh SGD associated with high nutrient concentrations is witnessed 10-20 days before the observations of algal bloom events. This study makes the first attempt to demonstrate the strong relation between the SGD and algal blooms over a vicennial span, and also provides a cost effective and robust technique to estimate SGD on a bay scale.

TI  - Role of Silviculture in the Formation of Norway Spruce Forests along the Southern Edge of Their Range in the Central Russian Plain
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - East European forests dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies(L.) H. Karst.) in the broad-leaved-coniferous zone should be considered as secondary communities formed under the influence of centuries-long activities (logging, fires and planting) and extended outside their natural range. The study raises an issue-how stable is the current state of Norway spruce forests in the center of the Russian plain and what is the effect of silviculture on the forest cover of the large urban agglomeration-the Moscow Region? Current study is based on multidisciplinary research and consequently concerns the age dynamics of spruce plantation forests, the species and typological diversity of mature spruce forests and spatial pattern of spruce forests along the south edge of their range. The composition and structure of Norway spruce plantations have been studied for various age classes and compared with mature natural spruce forests and pine plantations on the basis of field data. Remote sensing data and modeling approach were applied to estimate the spatial structure of spruce forests. It is found that mature plantations (over 80 years) become similar to natural forests in terms of structure and composition. The relationship between the distribution of spruce formations and the climatic and geomorphological conditions are confirmed. The proportion of spruce and spruce-aspen/birch communities follows the pattern of zones-the transition from the coniferous and broad-leaved forest zone to the broad-leaved forest zone. Despite the significant anthropogenic impact and the high proportion of plantations in the composition of Norway spruce forests (about 60-80%), their floristic and typological diversities correspond to such properties of zonal broad-leaved-coniferous communities. Over-matured plantations can provide valuable habitats for the re-establishment of native typological diversity. This makes it possible to use silviculture stands as an accelerated alternative to the natural recovery of disturbed habitats.

TI  - The Two-Year Radiometric Evaluation of Sentinel-3A OLCI via Intersensor Comparison With SNPP VIIRS
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The on-orbit calibration performance of the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel-3A satellite, launched on February 16, 2016, is evaluated via a radiometric intersensor comparison with reference to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite. Among the 21 OLCI bands (designated as "Oa" bands), which are reflective solar bands (RSBs), seven OLCI bands match up sufficiently well with the seven shortest wavelength SNPP VIIRS bands (M1-M7)-they are Oa02 at 412.5 nm, Oa03 at 442.5 nm, Oa04 at 490 nm, Oa06 at 560 nm, Oa08 at 665 nm, Oa12 at 754 nm, and Oa17 at 865 nm. The radiometric comparison adopts a "nadir-only" refinement of the simultaneous nadir overpass (SNO) approach and uses the official SNPP VIIRS RSB data processed by the Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS). The time-series result for bands Oa02, Oa03, Oa08, and Oa17, with spectral coverage that well represents the spectral range of OLCI, shows two-year stability at the level of 0.3% that supports nominally correct on-orbit calibration. The result for Oa08, Oa09, and Oa10, the three spectrally adjacent bands matching M5, demonstrates the effects of spectral mismatch-different radiometric ratio baselines and seasonally modulating patterns. Lastly, this result clarifies some key findings of earlier studies involving SNPP VIIRS and illustrates great potential for significantly more radiometric evaluation activities in the new era of Earth observations with many more powerful multispectral sensors coming into operation.

TI  - Modeling and Multi-Temporal Characterization of Total Suspended Matter by the Combined Use of Sentinel 2-MSI and Landsat 8-OLI Data: The Pertusillo Lake Case Study (Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The total suspended matter (TSM) variability plays a crucial role in a lake's ecological functioning and its biogeochemical cycle. Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Instrument (OLI) data offer unique opportunities for investigating certain in-water constituents (e.g., TSM and chlorophyll-a) owing to their spatial resolution (10-60 m). In this framework, we assessed the potential of MSI-OLI combined data in characterizing the multi-temporal (2014-2018) TSM variability in Pertusillo Lake (Basilicata region, Southern Italy). We developed and validated a customized MSI-based TSM model (R-2= 0.81) by exploiting ground measurements acquired during specific measurement campaigns. The model was then exported as OLI data through an intercalibration procedure (R-2= 0.87), allowing for the generation of a TSM multi-temporal MSI-OLI merged dataset. The analysis of the derived multi-year TSM monthly maps showed the influence of hydrological factors on the TSM seasonal dynamics over two sub-regions of the lake, the west and east areas. The western side is more influenced by inflowing rivers and water level fluctuations, the effects of which tend to longitudinally decrease, leading to less sediment within the eastern sub-area. The achieved results can be exploited by regional authorities for better management of inland water quality and monitoring systems.

TI  - Long-Term Grass Biomass Estimation of Pastures from Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The general consensus on future climate projections poses new and increased concerns about climate change and its impacts. Droughts are primarily worrying, since they contribute to altering the composition, distribution, and abundance of species. Grasslands, for example, are the primary source for grazing mammals and modifications in climate determine variation in the available yields for cattle. To support the agriculture sector, international organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations are promoting the development of dedicated monitoring initiatives, with particular attention for undeveloped and disadvantaged countries. The temporal scale is very important in this context, where long time series of data are required to compute consistent analyses. In this research, we discuss the results regarding long-term grass biomass estimation in an extended African region. The results are obtained by means of a procedure that is mostly automatic and replicable in other contexts. Zambia has been identified as a significant test area due to its vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change as a result of its geographic location, socioeconomic stresses, and low adaptive capacity. In fact, analysis and estimations were performed over a long time window (21 years) to identify correlations with climate variables, such as precipitation, to clarify sensitivity to climate change and possible effects already in place. From the analysis, decline in both grass quality and quantity was not currently evident in the study area. However, pastures in the considered area were found to be vulnerable to changing climate and, in particular, to the water shortages accompanying drought periods.

TI  - Short report: sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can also hurt me: understanding language interpreters' perceptions of stress/growth and needs in a pediatric medical setting
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - An increased focus on quality, trauma-informed patient care also warrants examination of providers' experiences of stress in medical settings. However, little is known about language interpreters' experiences of stress in the pediatric hospital setting, despite their involvement in acute and difficult patient encounters. This pilot study evaluated language interpreters' experiences and perceptions of stress in a large children's hospital. Descriptive and qualitative analyses, using a novel survey measure of interpreters' experiences, were performed to evaluate language interpreters' experiences with stressful patient encounters and identification of available and desired supports. All interpreters surveyed endorsed experiencing stress during challenging patient encounters in the hospital, though the majority also identified positive changes to their worldview as a result of their work. Results highlighted interpreters' strategies to cope with stress and perceived institutional needs to manage stressful encounters. Interpreters' experiences of stress in the pediatric hospital underscores needs for prevention and intervention efforts aimed at helping interpreters manage job-related stress. Preliminary, trauma-informed recommendations for working with and supporting interpreters are proposed.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability of Chlorophyll-A and Environmental Variables in the Panama Bight
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of synoptic satellite data of total chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and the environmental drivers that influence nutrient and light availability for phytoplankton growth allows us to understand the spatio-temporal variability of phytoplankton biomass. In the Panama Bight Tropical region (PB; 1-9 degrees N, 79-84 degrees W), the spatial distribution of Chl-a is mostly related to the seasonal wind patterns and the intensity of localized upwelling centers. However, the association between the Chl-a and different physical variables and nutrient availability is still not fully assessed. In this study, we evaluate the relationship between the Chl-a and multiple physical (wind, Ekman pumping, geostrophic circulation, mixed layer depth, sea level anomalies, river discharges, sea surface temperature, and photosynthetically available radiation) and chemical (nutrients) drivers in order to explain the spatio-temporal Chl-a variability in the PB. We used satellite data of Chl-a and physical variables, and a re-analysis of a biogeochemical product for nutrients (2002-2016). Our results show that at the regional scale, the Chl-a varies seasonally in response to the wind forcing and sea surface temperature. However, in the coastal areas (mainly Gulf of Panama and off central-southern Colombia), the maximum non-seasonal Chl-a values are found in association with the availability of nutrients by river discharges, localized upwelling centers and the geostrophic circulation field. From this study, we infer that the interplay among these physical-chemical drivers is crucial for supporting the phytoplankton growth and the high biodiversity of the PB region.

TI  - Assessment of tropical cyclone damage on dry forests using multispectral remote sensing: The case of Baja California Sur, Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclones (TCs) are extreme weather events that frequently occur along the coast of northwestern Mexico, but an assessment of dry forest damage on this area after their impact had not been investigated yet. Thus, the effect of strong winds and high precipitation rates were analyzed for the first time on the dry forests of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. An analysis was performed on the development of the TC Odile (2014) with winds above 200 km/h and TC Lidia (2017) with high precipitation rates in excess of 400 mm/day. The study used remote sensing tools to calculate changes in land areas from the vegetation indices and the non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV). The results showed a noticeable drop in the enhanced vegetation index (Delta EVI = 0.15) few days after Odile's landfall; after Lidia, the EVI values rose while the spatial distribution of changes on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and NPV showed the effect of large precipitation rates on vegetation damage. Intense winds from Odile triggered large changes in NDV-I with an increase of NPV. This study provides insight into the sensitivity of this ecosystem to strong winds and heavy rainfall on the magnitude of vegetation damage.

TI  - Plasmonic Nanobiosensing: from <i>in situ</i> plant monitoring to cancer diagnostics at the point of care
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nucleic acid biosensing technologies have the capability to provide valuable information in applications ranging from medical diagnostics to environmental sensing. The unique properties of plasmonic metallic nanoparticles have been used for sensing purposes and among them, plasmonic sensors based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) offer the advantages of sensitive and muliplexed detection owing to the narrow bandwidth of their characteristic Raman spectral features. This paper describes current applications that employ the unique SERS-based inverse molecular sentinel (iMS) nanobiosensors developed in our laboratory. Herein, we demonstrate the use of label-free iMS nanoprobes for detecting specific nucleic acid biomarkers in a wide variety of applications from cancer diagnostics to genetic monitoring for plant biology in renewable biofuel research.

TI  - Influence of Soil Properties on Maize and Wheat Nitrogen Status Assessment from Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil properties variability is a factor that greatly influences cereals crops production and interacts with a proper assessment of crop nutritional status, which is fundamental to support site-specific management able to guarantee a sustainable crop production. Several management strategies of precision agriculture are now available to adjust the nitrogen (N) input to the actual crop needs. Many of the methods have been developed for proximal sensors, but increasing attention is being given to satellite-based N management systems, many of which rely on the assessment of the N status of crops. In this study, the reliability of the crop nutritional status assessment through the estimation of the nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) from Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite images was examined, focusing of the impact of soil properties variability for crop nitrogen deficiency monitoring. Vegetation indices (VIs) and biophysical variables (BVs), such as the green area index (GAI_S2), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab_S2), and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC_S2), derived from S2 imagery, were used to investigate plant N status and NNI retrieval, in the perspective of its use for guiding site-specific N fertilization. Field experiments were conducted on maize and on durum wheat, manipulating 4 groups of plots, according to soil characteristics identified by a soil map and quantified by soil samples analysis, with different N treatments. Field data collection highlighted different responses of the crops to N rate and soil type in terms of NNI, biomass (W), and nitrogen concentration (Na%). For both crops, plots in one soil class (FOR1) evidenced considerably lower values of BVs and stress conditions with respect to others soil classes even for high N rates. Soil samples analyses showed for FOR1 soil class statistically significant differences for pH, compared to the other soil classes, indicating that this property could be a limiting factor for nutrient absorption, hence crop growth, regardless of the amount of N distributed to the crop. The correlation analysis between measured crop related BVs and satellite-based products (VIs and S2_BVs) shows that it is possible to: (i) directly derive NNI from CCC_S2 (R-2= 0.76) and either normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) for maize (R-2= 0.79) or transformed chlorophyll absorption ratio index (TCARI) for durum wheat (R-2= 0.61); (ii) indirectly estimate NNI as the ratio of plant nitrogen uptake (PNUa) and critical plant nitrogen uptake (PNUc) derived using CCC_S2 (R-2= 0.77) and GAI_S2 (R-2= 0.68), respectively. Results of this study confirm that NNI is a good indicator to monitor plants N status, but also highlights the importance of linking this information to soil properties to support N site-specific fertilization in the precision agriculture framework. These findings contribute to rational agro-practices devoted to avoid N fertilization excesses and consequent environmental losses, bringing out the real limiting factors for optimal crop growth.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Indications and Technique
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a key tool in the care of many patients with melanoma. The indications for the procedure have gradually become clearer over the 3 decades since the technique was developed. For appropriately selected patients, it carries enormous significance. Although it is a minimally invasive procedure, it does carry some risk. It is also a multidisciplinary procedure, requiring knowledge and experience from several specialties including nuclear medicine, surgery, and pathology.

TI  - A Kalman Filter Time Series Analysis Method for InSAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth orbiting satellites, such as Sentinel 1A-B, build up an ever-growing set of synthetic aperture radar images of the ground. This conceptually allows for real-time monitoring of ground displacements using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), notably in tectonically active regions such as fault zones or over volcanoes. We propose a Kalman filter for InSAR time series analysis (KFTS), an efficient method to rapidly update preexisting time series of displacement with data as they are made available, with limited computational cost. KFTS solves together for the evolution of phase change with time and for a parametrized model of ground deformation. Synthetic tests of the KFTS reveal exact agreement with the equivalent weighted least squares solution and a convergence of descriptive model parameter after the assimilation of about 1 year of data. We include the impact of sudden deformation events such as earthquakes or slow slip events on the time series of displacement. First tests of the KFTS on ENVISAT data over Mt. Etna (Sicily) and Sentinel 1 data around the Chaman fault (Afghanistan, Pakistan) show precise (0.05 mm) retrieval of phase change when data are sufficient. Otherwise, the optimized parametrized model is used to forecast phase change. Good agreement is found with classic time series analysis solution and GPS-derived time series. Accurate estimates are conditioned to the proper parametrization of errors so that models and observations can be combined with their respective uncertainties. This new tool is freely available to process ongoing InSAR time series.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Targeted therapies such as BRAF and MEK inhibitors and immunotherapies have been made available to treat melanoma. Objectives To provide an overview of the management of the French Stage III melanoma population after complete lymph node resection prior to new adjuvant therapies. Materials and Methods A subgroup data analysis. Results Data from 1,835 patients were analysed (15.58% Stage IIIA, 39.24% Stage IIIB, 43.92% Stage IIIC and 1.25% Stage IIID). Superficial spreading melanoma was the most frequent (70.98% in Stage IIIA for whom mutation analysis was performed; BRAF mutation was identified in up to 62% Stage IIIA patients). Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 88.46% of Stage IIIA patients, 42.36% of Stage IIIB, 53.97% of Stage IIIC and 34.78% of Stage IIID. Up to 80% of Stage IIIA patients had no adjuvant treatment follow-up. Ulceration (p = 0.004; RR: 2.98; 95% CI: 1.4-6.3) and age at diagnosis (p = 0.0002; RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02-1.06) were significant predictive factors for survival. Adjuvant interferon-alpha was administered in up to 13.04% of Stage IIID patients. Conclusion Only a small number of Stage III melanoma patients were treated with interferon-alpha in adjuvant settings. New adjuvant therapies are currently having an effect on clinical practice in France, increasing survival and decreasing cost.

TI  - 10 Years of Stellar Activity for GJ 1243
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The flaring M4 dwarf GJ 1243 has become a benchmark for studying stellar flare and starspot activity thanks to the exceptional photometric monitoring archive from the Kepler mission. New light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission for this star allow precise stellar activity characterization over more than a decade timescale. We have carried out the first flare and starspot analysis of GJ 1243 from over 50 days of data from TESS Sectors 14 and 15. Using 133 flare events detected in the 2 minute cadence TESS data, we compare the cumulative flare frequency distributions, and find the flare activity for GJ 1243 is unchanged between the Kepler and TESS epochs. Two distinct starspot groups are found in the TESS data, with the primary spot having the same rotational period and phase as seen in Kepler. The phase of the secondary spot feature is consistent with the predicted location of the secondary starspot and measurement of weak differential rotation, suggesting this secondary spot may be long-lived and stable in both latitude and longitude. As expected for this highly active star, the constant spot and flare activity reveal no sign of solar-like activity cycles over 10 yr. However, we highlight the unique ability for Kepler and TESS to use flare rates to detect activity cycles.

TI  - Deep Semantic Segmentation of Center Pivot Irrigation Systems from Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The center pivot irrigation system (CPIS) is a modern irrigation technique widely used in precision agriculture due to its high efficiency in water consumption and low labor compared to traditional irrigation methods. The CPIS is a leader in mechanized irrigation in Brazil, with growth forecast for the coming years. Therefore, the mapping of center pivot areas is a strategic factor for the estimation of agricultural production, ensuring food security, water resources management, and environmental conservation. In this regard, digital processing of satellite images is the primary tool allowing regional and continuous monitoring with low costs and agility. However, the automatic detection of CPIS using remote sensing images remains a challenge, and much research has adopted visual interpretation. Although CPIS presents a consistent circular shape in the landscape, these areas can have a high internal variation with different plantations that vary over time, which is difficult with just the spectral behavior. Deep learning using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is an emerging approach that provokes a revolution in image segmentation, surpassing traditional methods, and achieving higher accuracy and efficiency. This research aimed to evaluate the use of deep semantic segmentation of CPIS from CNN-based algorithms using Landsat-8 surface reflectance images (seven bands). The developed methodology can be subdivided into the following steps: (a) Definition of three study areas with a high concentration of CPIS in Central Brazil; (b) acquisition of Landsat-8 images considering the seasonal variations of the rain and drought periods; (c) definition of CPIS datasets containing Landsat images and ground truth mask of 256x256 pixels; (d) training using three CNN architectures (U-net, Deep ResUnet, and SharpMask); (e) accuracy analysis; and (f) large image reconstruction using six stride values (8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256). The three methods achieved state-of-the-art results with a slight prevalence of U-net over Deep ResUnet and SharpMask (0.96, 0.95, and 0.92 Kappa coefficients, respectively). A novelty in this research was the overlapping pixel analysis in the large image reconstruction. Lower stride values had improvements quantified by the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC curve) and Kappa, and fewer errors in the frame edges were also perceptible. The overlapping images significantly improved the accuracy and reduced the error present in the edges of the classified frames. Additionally, we obtained greater accuracy results during the beginning of the dry season. The present study enabled the establishment of a database of center pivot images and an adequate methodology for mapping the center pivot in central Brazil.

TI  - Lead toxicity on a sentinel species subpopulation inhabiting mangroves with different status conservation
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lead is a priority pollutant introduced in the aquatic environment by different sources commonly located in estuarine regions, such as ports, marinas and industries. Environmental agencies around the world set the maximum allowable concentration of lead in effluents, surface water and sediment, but few studies reported its accumulation and chronic toxicity in mangrove benthic invertebrates using concentrations believed to be safe. In the case of Brazilian mangrove environments, Ucides cordatus is a crab species of choice to be used in bioaccumulation studies. We have assessed biomarkers' responses (DNA strand breaks, micronucleated cells, metallothioneins, enzymatic activity of aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and neutral red retention time) and the total bioaccumulation in six tissues of U. cordatus crabs resident to mangrove areas under different conservation status during a 28-day period bioassay. We also investigated Pb subcellular partition and biomarkers' responses using a supposedly safe concentration (10 mu g L-1). During the Pb exposure, the highest concentration of Pb was observed in crab gills. Crabs also showed a high ability to allocate Pb in detoxified forms. Multivariate analysis pointed out that bioaccumulation (total, active and detoxified) is linked to biomarkers. Even in supposedly safe dosage, U. cordatus triggered its defense mechanisms expressing more metallothioneins and presented relevant cyto-genotoxic damage. Our data suggest the development of biological tolerance to Pb in crabs from polluted areas. Our results provided a new insight about lead toxicity even at concentrations considered environmentally safe, which could support new strategies to manage estuarine areas considering their respective conservation status.

TI  - The Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub: Protocol to Develop Extended COVID-19 Surveillance and Trial Platforms
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Routinely recorded primary care data have been used for many years by sentinel networks for surveillance. More recently, real world data have been used for a wider range of research projects to support rapid, inexpensive clinical trials. Because the partial national lockdown in the United Kingdom due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in decreasing community disease incidence, much larger numbers of general practices are needed to deliver effective COVID-19 surveillance and contribute to in-pandemic clinical trials.Objective: The aim of this protocol is to describe the rapid design and development of the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub (ORCHID) and its first two platforms. The Surveillance Platform will provide extended primary care surveillance, while the Trials Platform is a streamlined clinical trials platform that will be integrated into routine primary care practice.Methods: We will apply the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) metadata principles to a new, integrated digital health hub that will extract routinely collected general practice electronic health data for use in clinical trials and provide enhanced communicable disease surveillance. The hub will be findable through membership in Health Data Research UK and European metadata repositories. Accessibility through an online application system will provide access to study-ready data sets or developed custom data sets. Interoperability will be facilitated by fixed linkage to other key sources such as Hospital Episodes Statistics and the Office of National Statistics using pseudonymized data. All semantic descriptors (ie, ontologies) and code used for analysis will be made available to accelerate analyses. We will also make data available using common data models, starting with the US Food and Drug Administration Sentinel and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership approaches, to facilitate international studies. The Surveillance Platform will provide access to data for health protection and promotion work as authorized through agreements between Oxford, the Royal College of General Practitioners, and Public Health England. All studies using the Trials Platform will go through appropriate ethical and other regulatory approval processes.Results: The hub will be a bottom-up, professionally led network that will provide benefits for member practices, our health service, and the population served. Data will only be used for SQUIRE (surveillance, quality improvement, research, and education) purposes. We have already received positive responses from practices, and the number of practices in the network has doubled to over 1150 since February 2020. COVID-19 surveillance has resulted in tripling of the number of virology sites to 293 (target 300), which has aided the collection of the largest ever weekly total of surveillance swabs in the United Kingdom as well as over 3000 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serology samples. Practices are recruiting to the PRINCIPLE (Platform Randomised trial of INterventions against COVID-19 In older PeopLE) trial, and these participants will be followed up through ORCHID. These initial outputs demonstrate the feasibility of ORCHID to provide an extended national digital health hub.Conclusions: ORCHID will provide equitable and innovative use of big data through a professionally led national primary care network and the application of FAIR principles. The secure data hub will host routinely collected general practice data linked to other key health care repositories for clinical trials and support enhanced in situ surveillance without always requiring large volume data extracts. ORCHID will support rapid data extraction, analysis, and dissemination with the aim of improving future research and development in general practice to positively impact patient care.

TI  - A Hierarchical Deep-Learning Approach for Rapid Windthrow Detection on PlanetScope and High-Resolution Aerial Image Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest damage due to storms causes economic loss and requires a fast response to prevent further damage such as bark beetle infestations. By using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in conjunction with a GIS, we aim at completely streamlining the detection and mapping process for forest agencies. We developed and tested different CNNs for rapid windthrow detection based on PlanetScope satellite data and high-resolution aerial image data. Depending on the meteorological situation after the storm, PlanetScope data might be rapidly available due to its high temporal resolution, while the acquisition of high-resolution airborne data often takes weeks to a month and is, therefore, used in a second step for more detailed mapping. The study area is located in Bavaria, Germany (ca. 165 km(2)), and labels for damaged areas were provided by the Bavarian State Institute of Forestry (LWF). Modifications of a U-Net architecture were compared to other approaches using transfer learning (e.g., VGG19) to find the most efficient architecture for the task on both datasets while keeping the computational time low. A custom implementation of U-Net proved to be more accurate than transfer learning, especially on medium (3 m) resolution PlanetScope imagery (intersection over union score (IoU) 0.55) where transfer learning completely failed. Results for transfer learning based on VGG19 on high-resolution aerial image data are comparable to results from the custom U-Net architecture (IoU 0.76 vs. 0.73). When using both architectures on a dataset from a different area (located in Hesse, Germany), however, we find that the custom implementations have problems generalizing on aerial image data while VGG19 still detects most damage in these images. For PlanetScope data, VGG19 again fails while U-Net achieves reasonable mappings. Results highlight the potential of Deep Learning algorithms to detect damaged areas with an IoU of 0.73 on airborne data and 0.55 on Planet Dove data. The proposed workflow with complete integration into ArcGIS is well-suited for rapid first assessments after a storm event that allows for better planning of the flight campaign followed by detailed mapping in a second stage.

TI  - Elective Neck Dissection or Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Stage Oral Cavity Cancer Patients: The Dutch Experience
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been introduced as a diagnostic staging modality for detection of occult metastases in patients with early stage oral cancer. Comparisons regarding accuracy to the routinely used elective neck dissection (END) are lacking in literature. Methods: A retrospective, multicenter cohort study included 390 patients staged by END and 488 by SLNB. Results: The overall sensitivity (84% vs. 81%,p= 0.612) and negative predictive value (NPV) (93%,p= 1.000) were comparable between END and SLNB patients. The END cohort contained more pT2 tumours (51%) compared to the SLNB cohort (23%) (p< 0.001). No differences were found for sensitivity and NPV between SLNB and END divided by pT stage. In floor-of-mouth (FOM) tumours, SLNB had a lower sensitivity (63% vs. 92%,p= 0.006) and NPV (90% vs. 97%,p= 0.057) compared to END. Higher disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were found for pT1 SLNB patients compared to pT1 END patients (96% vs. 90%,p= 0.048). Conclusion: In the absence of randomized clinical trials, this study provides the highest available evidence that, in oral cancer, SLNB is as accurate as END in detecting occult lymph node metastases, except for floor-of-mouth tumours.

TI  - Detecting Matching Blunders of Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images via Graph Theory
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large radiometric and geometric distortion in multi-source images leads to fewer matching points with high matching blunder ratios, and global geometric relationship models between multi-sensor images are inexplicit. Thus, traditional matching blunder detection methods cannot work effectively. To address this problem, we propose two matching blunder detection methods based on graph theory. The proposed methods can build statistically significant clusters in the case of few matching points with high matching blunder ratios, and use local geometric similarity constraints to detect matching blunders when the global geometric relationship is not explicit. The first method (named the complete graph-based method) uses clusters constructed by matched triangles in complete graphs to encode the local geometric similarity of images, and it can detect matching blunders effectively without considering the global geometric relationship. The second method uses the triangular irregular network (TIN) graph to approximate a complete graph to reduce to computational complexity of the first method. We name this the TIN graph-based method. Experiments show that the two graph-based methods outperform the classical random sample consensus (RANSAC)-based method in recognition rate, false rate, number of remaining matching point pairs, dispersion, positional accuracy in simulated and real data (image pairs from Gaofen1, near infrared ray of Gaofen1, Gaofen2, panchromatic Landsat, Ziyuan3, Jilin1and unmanned aerial vehicle). Notably, in most cases, the mean false rates of RANSAC, the complete graph-based method and the TIN graph-based method in simulated data experiments are 0.50, 0.26 and 0.14, respectively. In addition, the mean positional accuracy (RMSE measured in units of pixels) of the three methods is 2.6, 1.4 and 1.5 in real data experiments, respectively. Furthermore, when matching blunder ratio is no higher than 50%, the computation time of the TIN graph-based method is nearly equal to that of the RANSAC-based method, and roughly 2 to 40 times less than that of the complete graph-based method.

TI  - Identification of Short-Rotation Eucalyptus Plantation at Large Scale Using Multi-Satellite Imageries and Cloud Computing Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new method to identify short-rotation eucalyptus plantations by exploring both the changing pattern of vegetation indices due to tree crop rotation and spectral characteristics of eucalyptus in the red-edge region is presented. It can be adopted to produce eucalyptus maps of high spatial resolution (30 m) at large scales, with the use of open remote sensing images from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), as well as a free cloud computing platform, Google Earth Engine (GEE). The method is composed of three main steps. First, a time series of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is constructed from Landsat data for each pixel, and a statistical hypothesis testing is followed to determine whether the pixel belongs to a tree plantation or not based on the idea that tree crops should be harvested in a specific period. Then, a broadleaf/needleleaf classification is applied to distinguish eucalyptus from coniferous trees such as pine and fir using the red-edge bands of Sentinel-2 data. Refinements based on superpixel are performed at last to remove the salt-and-pepper effects resulted from per-pixel detection. The proposed method allows gaps in the time series that are very common in tropical and subtropical regions by employing time series segmentation and statistical hypothesis testing, and could capture forest disturbances such as conversion of natural forest or agricultural lands to eucalyptus plantations emerged in recent years by using a short observing time. The experiment in Guangxi province of China demonstrated that the method had an overall accuracy of 87.97%, with producer's accuracy of 63.85% and user's accuracy of 66.89% for eucalyptus plantations.

TI  - Image captioning using DenseNet network and adaptive attention
T2  - SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the image captioning problem, it is difficult to correctly extract the global features of the images. At the same time, most attention methods force each word to correspond to the image region, ignoring the phenomenon that words such as "the" in the description text cannot correspond to the image region. To address these problems, an adaptive attention model with a visual sentinel is proposed in this paper. In the encoding phase, the model introduces DenseNet to extract the global features of the image. At the same time, on each time axis, the sentinel gate is set by the adaptive attention mechanism to decide whether to use the image feature information for word generation. In the decoding phase, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network is applied as a language generation model for image captioning tasks to improve the quality of image caption generation. Experiments on the Flickr30k and COCO datasets indicate that the proposed model exhibits significant improvement in terms of the BLEU and METEOR evaluation criteria.

T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing land use and land cover (LULC) change in Lake Ziway watershed is important to evaluate the degradation of ecosystems and their environmental processes caused by the ongoing increase in human pressures. The present study analyzed the long-term LULC dynamics in the Lake Ziway watershed, which covers 7300 km(2) in the Ethiopian Central Rift Valley region. Three Landsat Satellite Image Series - Landsat MSS (1973), Landsat TM (1989) and Landsat Enhanced ETM + (2018) - were the main input data from which three LULC maps were produced by employing Remote Sensing Techniques and Geographical Information Systems. The satellite data were supported by Google Earth and information gathered from informal discussions from local elderly people who are knowledgeable aboutthe area. The results over the last 45 years show that the major LULC changes in the study watershed have been the expansion of cultivated, agroforestry and settlement areas and the corresponding reduction in woodlands. Cultivation, agroforestry, and settlement LULC categories increased by 45%, 10.9%, and 141.4%, respectively. These changes are attributable to a combination of the ever increasing human population and the subsequent demands on environmental resources like agricultural lands, commercial and domestic fuelwood and charcoal. Other factors include poorly defined ownership arrangements and weak enforcement strategies on the existing land use policy. This has created open access mentalities among communities and intensified LULC changes in the watershed. Awareness raising and provision of technical training about conservation interventions should be provided to communities in the watershed.This study provides information for corrective measures to protect further degradation and irreversible losses that might happen to the biotic and abiotic resources in Lake Ziway watershed.

TI  - Toward Improved Accuracy of Remote Sensing Approaches for Quantifying Suspended Sediment: Implications for Suspended-Sediment Monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the high logistical and financial costs of direct measurements of riverine suspended sediment, remote sensing is increasingly used to supplement the direct-observation record. The accuracy of this method is poorly constrained, and its potential as a tool for understanding river sediment transport is thus limited. We introduce and apply global-scale methods for estimating depth-integrated suspended-sediment concentrations (SSCs) using Landsat 5 and 7 satellite imagery calibrated with 134,697 in situ SSC measurements. We account for river-to-river variability in the relationship between water optical properties and SSC by (a) categorizing rivers using unsupervised K-means clustering and/or (b) correcting calibration estimates for individual rivers using local in situ measurements of SSC, suspended-sediment grain size, and percent organic carbon (POC). In the absence of site-specific in situ SSC measurements, clustering rivers reduces the average relative error of SSC estimates from 97% to 73%. We show that as few as five site-specific in situ measurements combined with our algorithm further reduces average relative error to 49% and average relative at-a-station bias in SSC to 7%. Little additional improvement in accuracy or bias is gained by including measurements of percent sand or POC of the suspended sediment. Since only modest additional accuracy is gained after similar to 5-10 paired in situ SSC measurements and satellite observations, sampling campaigns should prioritize limited sampling at diverse locations rather than intensive sampling at a limited number of sites. In addition, we publish standalone calibrations for 151 rivers made solely with in situ SSC measurements local to those sites.

TI  - From the Ontological Turn to Relational and Political Ontology: A Review of Arturo Escobar's Proposal
T2  - CUADERNOS DE FILOSOFIA LATINOAMERICANA
M3  - Review
AB  - This article analyses Arturo Escobar's ontological approach according to the two main ways in which it is expressed, so as to identify its scope and limitations. The first way is rooted in the author's concept of relational ontology and the second one concerns so-called political ontology. The text is divided into four sections. The first section, focusing on Martin Heidegger, introduces the reader the meaning of the question of Being. So as to elucidate Escobar's proposal of relational ontology, the second section briefly expounds the academic position of the Colombian anthropologist, which looks at the ontological from the point of view of anthropology, upholding a criticism of the dualist nature/culture Western paradigm and, in turn, of decolonial theories that denounce Modernity and the validity of the colonialism of being. By means of the categories of territory and pluriverse, the third section touches upon a fundamental premise: that all thought about the political presupposes an ontology, that is, a worldview which explains what exists; this is how an ontological project is articulated, through relationality, with struggles that affirm the worlds and the rights of communities. The fourth and last section is an assessment of the scope and limits of Escobar's ontology, as well as of possible opportunities for future research.

TI  - Flood Risk Analysis and Assessment, Applications and Uncertainties: A Bibliometric Review
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Studies looking at flood risk analysis and assessment (FRA) reviews are not customary, and they usually approach to methodological and spatial scale issues, uncertainty, mapping or economic damage topics. However, most of these reviews provide a snapshot of the scientific state of the art of FRA that shows only a partial view, focused on a limited number of selected methods and approaches. In this paper, we apply a bibliometric analysis using the Web of Science (WoS) database to assess the historic evolution and future prospects (emerging fields of application) of FRA. The scientific production of FRA has increased considerably in the past decade. At the beginning, US researchers dominated the field, but now they have been overtaken by the Chinese. The Netherlands and Germany may be highlighted for their more complete analyses and assessments (e.g., including an uncertainty analysis of FRA results), and this can be related to the presence of competitive research groups focused on FRA. Regarding FRA fields of application, resilience analysis shows some growth in recent years while land planning, risk perception and risk warning show a slight decrease in the number of papers published. Global warming appears to dominate part of future FRA production, which affects both fluvial and coastal floods. This, together with the improvement of economic evaluation and psycho-social analysis, appear to be the main trends for the future evolution of FRA. Finally, we cannot ignore the increase in analysis using big data analysis, machine learning techniques, and remote sensing data (particularly in the case of UAV sensors data).

TI  - Construction and classification of coral reef geomorphic unit system based on high-resolution remote sensing: using 8-band Worldview-2 Image as an example
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reef ecosystem is one of the ecosystems with the highest primary productivity in the world. It plays an important role in maintaining marine biodiversity, preventing waves and consolidating beaches, and it is great resources for mankind. At the same time, the remote sensing geomorphological classification system of coral reefs is the necessary basis for the protection, management and sustainable development of coral reefs. However, there is no corresponding classification system taking coral coverage into account. Based on WorldView-2 high-resolution remote sensing image, we selected the reef of Zhaoshu Dao and Xisha Zhou in the north of Qilianyu Island, Xisha Islands, South China Sea as our study area. In this paper, coral coverage, regional geomorphic composition and hydrodynamic conditions are used to establish a coral reef geomorphic unit classification system suitable for remote sensing monitoring and are related to the survival of coral reefs. The method of object-oriented support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) were used to extract the coral reef geomorphic units, and the accuracy of the extraction results was evaluated. The results showed that both SVM and RF classification methods can extract reef geomorphic units, and the classification accuracy was 87.59% and 79.81%, respectively. Aiming at the problem of misclassification and omission in the process of classification, we modified the classification results according to the causes and distributions of coral reefs. And the accuracy of modified classification was 91.3%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.9041. They showed that the coral reef geomorphic unit classification system constructed in this paper can meet the need of information extraction of coral reefs to some extent.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study belongs to the biomonitoring program of soil qualities using a land snail,Cantareus aspersus, as bioindicator. The metal-soil contamination in some sites (National Park of El Kala (NPK), El Bouni, Sidi Amar, Nechmaya, and Guelma) located in Northeast Algeria were determined during two seasons (winter and spring 2015, 2016). Glutathione (GSH) content and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were significantly decreased in snails collected during spring as compared with those noticed during winter under bioclimate change. In addition, a significant difference between various sites was observed, depending on the proximity to pollution sources. The significant variation of biomarker levels is a function of the physic-chemical properties of soils when they positively correlated with EC, H, and OM, and negatively correlated with all metallic elements. Moreover, Fe and Al(2)O(3)are the most abundant in all the sites, and the most polluted site was found as that of El Bouni, followed by Sidi Amar, Nechmaya, and Guelma, since NPK is the less polluted site and considered a reference site. The tested biomarkers are sensitive oxidative parameters in snails exposed to pollution correlated significantly with the soil physic-chemical properties and metallic element contents in soil. Indeed,C. aspersuscould be used as sentinel species in field monitoring of Mediterranean climate regions.

TI  - Predictability of Seasonal Streamfiow and Soil Moisture in National Water Model and a Humid Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the potential predictability of streamflow and soil moisture in the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa (ACT) river basin in the southeastern United States. The study employs the state-of-the-art National Water Model (NWM) and compares the effects of initial soil moisture condition with those of seasonal climate anomalies on streamflow and soil moisture forecast skills. We have designed and implemented seasonal streamflow forecast ensemble experiments following the methodology suggested by Dirmeyer et al. The study also compares the soil moisture variability in the NWM with in situ measurements and remote sensing data from the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) satellite. The NWM skillfully simulates the observed streamflow in the ACT basin. The soil moisture variability is 46% smaller in the NWM compared with the SMAP data, mainly due to a weaker amplitude of the seasonal cycle. This study finds that initial soil moisture condition is a major source of predictability for the seasonal streamflow forecast. The contribution of the initial soil moisture condition is comparable or even higher than that of seasonal climate anomaly effects in dry seasons. In the boreal summer season, the initial soil moisture condition contributes to 65% and 48% improvements in the seasonal streamflow and soil moisture forecast skills, respectively. This study attributes a greater improvement in the streamflow forecast skill to the lag effects between the soil moisture and streamflow anomalies. The results of this study can inform the development and improvement of the operational streamflow forecasting system.

TI  - The Possibility of Applying Acoustic Emission and Dynamometric Methods for Monitoring the Turning Process
T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensuring optimal turning conditions has a huge impact on the quality and properties of the machined surface. The condition of the cutting tool is one of the factors to achieve this goal. In order to control its wear during the turning process, monitoring was used. In this study, the acoustic emission method and measure of cutting forces during turning were used for monitoring that process. The research was carried out on a universal lathe center (CU500MRD type) using a Kistler dynamometer with assembled removable insert CCET09T302R-MF by DIJET Industrial CO., LTD. A dynamometer allows to measure forces Fx (radial force), Fy (feed force) and Fz (cutting force). The turning process was performed on a shaft with 60 mm diameter made of 304L stainless steel. The AE research was carried at Physical Acoustics Corporation with the kit that includes: recorder USB AE Node, preamplifier, AE-sensor VS 150M and computer with dedicated software used for recording and analyzing AE data. The aim of this paper is to compare selected diagnostic methods: acoustic emission and cutting forces measurement for monitoring wear of cutting tool edge. Analysis of the research results showed that both selected methods of monitoring the turning process allowed the determination of the beginning of the tool damage process.

TI  - Adjuvant therapy with pegylated interferon-alfa2b vs observation in stage II B/C patients with ulcerated primary: Results of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 18081 randomised trial
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Subgroup analyses of two large EORTC adjuvant interferon-alpha2b (IFN alpha-2b) vs observation randomised trials demonstrated that a treatment benefit was observed only in patients with an ulcerated melanoma without palpable nodes (hazard ratio [HR] for recurrence-free survival [RFS] was 0.69). This was confirmed by a meta-analysis of 15 adjuvant IFN trials (HR: 0.79).Patients and methods: In the EORTC 18081 trial, sentinel node-negative stage II patients with an ulcerated primary melanoma were 1: 1 randomised between pegylated (PEG)-IFN alpha-2b at 3 mu g/kg/week subcutaneously and observation, for 2 years, or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity in spite of dose adjustments to maintain an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Main end-point was RFS. Secondary end-points included distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), overall survival, and safety (EudraCT Number: 2009-010273-20).Results: Between February 2013 and January 2017, only 112 patients were randomised, 56 in each arm. The trial was stopped early for lack of recruitment. At a 3.4-year median follow-up, the estimated HR for the PEG-IFN alpha-2b group compared with the observation group regarding RFS was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32-1.37), and the 3-year RFS rate was 80.0% (95% CI: 65.7-88.8%) and 72.9% (95% CI: 58.3-83.0%), respectively. DMFS was prolonged: HR: 0.39 (95% CI: 0.15-0.97), and the 3-year DMFS rate was 90.6% (95% CI: 78.9-96.0%) vs 76.4% (95% CI: 62.1-85.9%). One patient in the PEG-IFN alpha-2b group died compared with 4 in the observation group. Fifty-four patients started PEG-IFN alpha-2b treatment, 16 (29%) completed 2 years of treatment, 2 (4%) stopped due to recurrence, 23 (43%) due to toxicity and 14 (25%) due to other reasons.Conclusions: The EORTC 18081 PEG-IFN alpha-2b randomised trial, observed a similar HR (0.69) for RFS as the previous EORTC trials (0.69). In countries without access to new drugs, adjuvant (PEG)-IFN alpha-2b treatment is an option for patients with ulcerated melanomas without palpable nodes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integration of remote sensing data and in situ measurements to monitor the water quality of the Ismailia Canal, Nile Delta, Egypt
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ismailia Canal is one of the most important tributaries of the River Nile in Egypt. It is threatened by extinction from several sources of pollution, in addition to the intersection and nearness of the canal path with the Bilbayes drain and the effluent from the two largest conventional wastewater treatment plants in Greater Cairo. In this study, the integration of remote sensing and geospatial information system techniques is carried out to enhance the contribution of satellite data in water quality management in the Ismailia Canal. A Landsat-8 operational land imager image dated 2018 was used to detect the land use and land cover changes in the area of study, in addition to retrieving various spectral band ratios. Statistical correlations were applied among the extracted band ratios and the measured in situ water quality parameters. The most appropriate spectral band ratios were extracted from the NIR band (near infrared/blue), which showed a significant correlation with eight water quality metrics (CO3, BOD5, COD, TSS, TDS, Cl, NH4, and fecal coliform bacteria). A linear regression model was then established to predict information about these important water quality parameters along Ismailia Canal. The developed models, using linear regression equations for this study, give a set of powerful decision support frameworks with statistical tools to provide comprehensive, integrated views of surface water quality information under similar circumstances.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Assessment of Land Deformation as a Factor Contributing to Relative Sea Level Rise in Coastal Urban and Natural Protected Areas Using Multi-Source Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rise in sea level is expected to considerably aggravate the impact of coastal hazards in the coming years. Low-lying coastal urban centers, populated deltas, and coastal protected areas are key societal hotspots of coastal vulnerability in terms of relative sea level change. Land deformation on a local scale can significantly affect estimations, so it is necessary to understand the rhythm and spatial distribution of potential land subsidence/uplift in coastal areas. The present study deals with the determination of the relative vertical rates of the land deformation and the sea-surface height by using multi-source Earth observation-synthetic aperture radar (SAR), global navigation satellite system (GNSS), tide gauge, and altimetry data. To this end, the multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MT-InSAR) technique was used in order to exploit the most recent Copernicus Sentinel-1 data. The products were set to a reference frame by using GNSS measurements and were combined with a re-analysis model assimilating satellite altimetry data, obtained by the Copernicus Marine Service. Additional GNSS and tide gauge observations have been used for validation purposes. The proposed methodological approach has been implemented in three pilot cases: the city of Alexandroupolis in the Evros Delta region, the coastal zone of Thermaic Gulf, and the coastal area of Killini, Araxos (Patras Gulf) in the northwestern Peloponnese, which are Greek coastal areas with special characteristics. The present research provides localized relative sea-level estimations for the three case studies. Their variation is high, ranging from values close to zero, i.e., from 5-10 cm and 30 cm in 50 years for urban areas to values of 50-60 cm in 50 years for rural areas, close to the coast. The results of this research work can contribute to the effective management of coastal areas in the framework of adaptation and mitigation strategies attributed to climate change. Scaling up the proposed methodology to a continental level is required in order to overcome the existing lack of proper assessment of the relevant hazard in Europe.

TI  - Body education in the Kichwa Mandari Panga community. Worldview of the indigenous peoples in the body
T2  - EDUCACION FISICA Y CIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The following article describes and analyzes the body education observed in the Kichwa Mandari Panga community of the Ecuadorian Amazon, from a perspective focused on the recovery of knowledge of the original peoples of Latin America. It is based on the information obtained in the ethnographic work carried out in the community, in triangulation with different documents from communities of indigenous peoples. From this, the work tries to describe how the different representations of the body in the community, expressed in the Kichwa worldviews, are linked to certain bodily practices. In this way, the possibility of beginning to analyze the community's body education from its ancestral knowledge in dialogue with the knowledge of Physical Education is raised; an education of the body that assumes an intimate relationship with the environment and with the community, opposed to hegemonic approaches that consider people as individuals and the environment as a natural resource.

T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from MERIS onboard Envisat and MODIS onboard Terra and Aqua for 15-16 May 2010 were used to study powerful imprints of atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) on the western part the Black Sea surface. Two cold fronts crossed the sea following the warm front and caused the AGWs which modulated the sea surface. Imprints of AGWs appeared as stripes of alternating brightness, they had crest length more than a hundred kilometers and wavelength of units of kilometers. Wave amplitude of AGWs imprints, evaluated by a 90%-depth of light penetration into the sea at 490 nm z(90), the value inverse to the diffuse attenuation coefficient Kd_ 490, was units of decimeterxs. MODIS 250-m data of remote sensing reflectance, wind components and atmospheric pressure near the sea surface were obtained by processing the top of atmosphere data with the SeaDAS software package. Negative correlations of fluctuations of z(90) with fluctuations of wind stress and atmospheric pressure were found on the transects of more than ten kilometers. The impact of wind stress on the origination of AGW imprints was found to be determinant, while the impact of atmospheric pressure was not more than units of percent.

TI  - Machine learning algorithms for retrievals of aerosol and ocean color products from FY-3D MERSI-II instrument
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Heritage atmospheric correction (AC) and ocean inherent optical property (IOP) retrieval algorithms, such as those implemented in NASA's SeaDAS platform, often produce questionable results in complex environments, such as in turbid coastal and inland waters and for heavy aerosol loadings. We present new AC and ocean IOP retrieval algorithms for the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager - II (MERSI-II) onboard the FengYun-3D satellite that solve these problems. The algorithm development is based on extensive radiative transfer simulations for a coupled atmosphere-ocean system in conjunction with machine learning techniques (i.e. multi-layer neural networks) to retrieve ocean color products from MERSI-II sensor data. The final ocean color products include spectral remote sensing reflectances (R-rs(lambda) values), chlorophyll_a concentration (CHL), and IOPs, i.e. absorption by phytoplankton (a(ph)(lambda)), absorption by detritus and gelbstoff (a(dg)(lambda)), and particulate backscattering (b(bp)(lambda)). Spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) and cloud mask results are also provided. The new machine learning based algorithms are first tested using independent synthetic datasets and show very good performance. The average percentage error (APE) is less than 7% for the R-rs retrievals and less than 5.2% for the AOD retrievals with a 1% uncertainty added to the TOA reflectances. The ocean color products retrieved from MERSI-II sensor data are validated against AERONET-OC field measurements and show good quality. For Rrs retrievals, the APE is around 30% for blue and red bands and 22% for green band. For AOD retrievals, the APE is also around 23% - 30%, and for CHL retrievals, the APE is around 32%. The ocean color products retrieved from MERSI-II sensor data are also cross-validated with the corresponding ones retrieved from Aqua/MODIS data using both NASA SeaDAS package and our machine learning based (DC-SMART algorithms. The results show that these machine learning algorithms completely resolve the negative R-rs(lambda) issue that persists in heritage AC algorithms and significantly improve the quality of retrieved ocean color products, especially in coastal regions. The histograms of the retrieved R-rs, CHL, and ocean IOP products also show good agreement between MERSI-II and Aqua/MODIS ocean color retrievals. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Earth, World, and the Human <i>Samuel Beckett and the Ethics of Climate Crisis</i>
T2  - SAMUEL BECKETT TODAY/AUJOURD'HUI
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay reads the ungraspable relation to death in Beckett's works as a means to think through our contemporary era of climate crisis. Beckett's singular aesthetics of human finitude can be a powerful resource for thinking the unthinkable. By envisaging finitude in terms of the limits imposed on life by both space and time, this essay seeks to ground the existential framework of Beckett's oeuvre in terms of an always embedded self. Looking at the short story "The End," I show how such embeddedness may work to evade totalisation or abstraction in terms of a universal worldview, yet also how it poses problems for any privileging of materiality as such. Beckett's writings are thereby seen to produce a dynamic ethics between world and earth, the global and the local, life and death.

TI  - Lake Topography and Active Storage From Satellite Observations of Flood Frequency
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Topography is critical information for water resources management in lakes, and remote sensing provides a unique opportunity to estimate topography in ungauged regions. We introduce here a new method that estimates nearshore topography of water bodies based on a flood frequency map and time series of water levels by assuming the equivalence between flood frequency and water level exceedance probability at a given area. Test cases are performed for two lakes and 12 hydropower reservoirs using the proposed Flood2Topo app. This new application generates the bottom level pixel by pixel and level-area-active storage relationship directly from the topography map, without the need to fit functions. Flood extent estimates from the Landsat based Global Surface Water (GSW) data set, the current state-of-the-art, were used to run Flood2Topo, together with water levels from satellite altimetry and in situ gauges. Results show bottom level root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 18.5 and 146 cm for Lake Poopo (Bolivia) and Lake Curuai (Amazon basin), respectively. For reservoir active storage, RMSD normalized values ranged from 2% to 11% for 11 reservoirs (average NRMSD of 6.4%). The method can be applied to any seasonally flooded area using any data set. Considering the surface water occurrence map from the GSW data set, the method is applicable to 35.8% (86%) of the global seasonally flooded areas delimited by flood frequencies between 0 and 95% (99%) over 35 years. The flood frequency-based method is a promising tool for obtaining data for hydrodynamic simulations and monitoring of ungauged water bodies.

TI  - Comparison of spectral and spatial-based approaches for mapping the local variation of soil moisture in a semi-arid mountainous area
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on soil moisture (SM) is critical in various applications including agriculture, climate, hydrology, soil and drought. In this paper, various predictive relationships including regression (Multiple Linear Regression, MLR), machine learning (Random Forest, RF; Triangular regression, Tr) and spatial modeling (Inverse Distance Weighing, IDW and Ordinary kriging, OK) approaches were compared to estimate SM in a semi-arid mountainous watershed. In developing predictive relationship, Remote Sensing datasets including Landsat 8 satellite imagery derived surface biophysical characteristic, ASTER digital elevation model (DEM) derived surface topographical characteristic, climatic data recorded at the synoptic station and in situ SM data measured at Landsat 8 overpass time were utilized, while in spatial modeling, point-based SM measurements were interpolated. While 70%(calibration set) of the measured SM data were used for modeling, 30%(validation set) were used to evaluate modeling accuracy. Finally, the SM uncertainty maps were created for different models based on a bootstrapping approach. Among the environmental parameter sets, land surface temperature (LST) showed the highest impact on the spatial distribution of SM in the region at all dates. Mean R-2(RMSE) between measured and modeled SM on three dates obtained from the MLR, RF, IDW, OK, and Tr models were 0.70(1.97%), 0.72 (1.92%), 0.59(2.38%), 0.59(2.27%) and 0.71(1.99%), respectively. The results showed that RF and IDW produced the highest and lowest performance in SM modeling, respectively. Generally, the performance of RS-based models was higher than interpolation models for estimating SM due to the influence from combination of topographic parameters and surface biophysical characteristics. Modeled SM uncertainty with different models varies in the study area. The highest uncertainty in SM modeling was observed at the north part of the study area where the surface heterogeneity is high. Using RS data increased the accuracy of SM modeling because they can capture the surface biophysical characteristics and topographical properties heterogeneity. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim To evaluate the transferability between fire recurrence scenarios of post-fire vegetation cover models calibrated with satellite imagery data at different spatial resolutions within two Mediterranean pine forest sites affected by large wildfires in 2012. Location The northwest and east of the Iberian Peninsula. Methods In each study site, we defined three fire recurrence scenarios for a reference period of 35 years. We used image texture derived from the surface reflectance channels of WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 (at a spatial resolution of 2 m x 2 m and 20 m x 20 m, respectively) as predictors of post-fire vegetation cover in Random Forest regression analysies. Percentage vegetation cover was sampled in two sets of field plots with a size roughly equivalent to the spatial resolution of the imagery. The plots were distributed following a stratified design according to fire recurrence scenarios. Model transferability was assessed within each study site by applying the vegetation cover model developed for a given fire recurrence scenario to predict vegetation cover in other scenarios, iteratively. Results For both wildfires, the highest model transferability between fire recurrence scenarios was achieved for those holding the most similar vegetation community composition regarding the balance of species abundance according to their plant-regenerative traits (root mean square error [RMSE] around or lower than 15%). Model transferability performance was highly improved by fine-grained remote-sensing data. Conclusions Fire recurrence is a major driver of community structure and composition so the framework proposed in this study would allow land managers to reduce efforts in the context of post-fire decision-making to assess vegetation recovery within large burned landscapes with fire regime variability.

TI  - Esophageal foreign bodies: observational cohort study and factors associated with recurrent impaction
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aimEsophageal foreign bodies, including food bolus impaction, represent a common clinical problem. The prevalence of underlying esophageal disease depends on study design and degree of suspicion of a structural or functional esophageal abnormality. Aim of this study was to analyze factors associated with recurrent impaction.MethodsThe prospectively collected database at a University Hospital and Swallowing Center was reviewed from January 2012 to June 2019 to identify all patients admitted for esophageal foreign bodies. Patients who underwent an emergency endoscopic procedure represented the final study sample. Patient characteristics, including history of previous esophageal foreign bodies, and type of endoscopic procedure were collected.ResultsSixty-five patients, 41 males and 24 females with a median age of 59 years, underwent emergency endoscopy for esophageal foreign bodies during the study period. Food bolus was the most common foreign body (n = 43, 66%). Flexible endoscopy was successful in retrieving or pushing the foreign bodies in the stomach in 91% of patients. In 54% of patients, impaction was secondary to an underlying esophageal disorder, which was previously unrecognized in half of them. Recurrent impaction was more common in patients with esophageal disease (P < 0.011). Surgical therapy was required in 4 patients (6.1%).ConclusionsFood bolus impaction is a common sentinel event in patients with underlying esophageal disease and is associated with recurrent impaction. Diagnostic endoscopy with biopsies should possibly be performed at the first episode of impaction. Patients with negative biopsies should undergo barium swallow study and high-resolution esophageal manometry.

TI  - Plastic ingestion lead to reduced body condition and modified diet patterns in the rocky shore crab <i>Pachygrapsus transversus</i> (Gibbes, 1850) (Brachyura: Grapsidae)
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we aimed to identify impacts of plastic ingestion by the ecologically important rocky shore crab Pachygrapsus transversus. We sampled individuals from August 2019 to January 2020 in a reef environment and determined their body condition and diet diversity. In order to test our hypothesis that plastic retention in the foregut is able to decrease the condition factor, we compared it between contaminated and non-contaminated individuals. A correlation test of number of ingested plastic fibres against trophic diversity was made to corroborate the hypothesis that plastic ingestion modifies the feeding patterns. Our results demonstrated that contaminated individuals had lower body condition. Also, we confirmed that debris ingestion can influence feeding patterns. These outcomes were probably linked to starvation and nutrient loss effects. We discussed that this crab is a potential sentinel specie for addressing impacts of solid pollution and a candidate for monitoring plastic contamination in reef environments.

TI  - Surface Deformation Related to the 2019 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.1 and 6.4 Ridgecrest Earthquakes in California from GPS, SAR Interferometry, and SAR Pixel Offsets
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from Copernicus Sentinel-1A and 1B satellites operated by the European Space Agency and the Advanced Land Observation Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) satellite operated by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data from the Network of the Americas for the 4 July 2019 M-w 6.4 and 5 July (local; 6 July UTC) M-w 7.1 Ridgecrest earthquakes. We integrated geodetic measurements for the 3D vector field of coseismic surface deformation for the two events, using SAR data from Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 satellites. We combined less precise large-scale displacements from SAR images by pixel offset tracking or matching, including the along-track component, with the more precise SAR interferometry (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar [InSAR]) measurements in the radar line of sight (LoS) direction and intermediate-precision along-track InSAR to estimate all three components of the surface displacement for the two events together. We also estimated the coseismic deformation for the two earthquakes from time-series processing of continuous Global Navigation Satellite System data stations in the area. InSAR coherence and coherence change maps the surface disruptions due to fault ruptures reaching the surface. Large slip in the M-w 6.4 earthquake was on a NE-striking fault that intersects with the NW-striking fault that was the main rupture in the M-w 7.1 earthquake. The main fault bifurcates towards the southeast ending 3 km from the Garlock Fault. The Garlock fault had triggered slip of about 20 mm in the radar LoS along a short section directly south of the main rupture. About 3 km northwest of the M-w 7.1 epicenter, the surface fault separates into two strands that form a pull-apart with about 1 m of downdrop. Further northwest is a wide zone of complex deformation.

TI  - Impact Assessment of COVID-19 on Variations of SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO and AOD over East China
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) broke out in the late of 2019. On January 23 in Wuhan, and later in all other cities of the country, there were taken measures to control the spread of the virus through quarantine measures. This article focused on East China and attempted to assess comprehensively the environmental impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study analyzed satellite observational data of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the period before the outbreak of the epidemic and during the implementation of preventive measures and control of COVID-19, as well as compared it with the data obtained in the same period of 2019. The results of the analysis showed that the COVID-19 lockdown improved air quality in the short term, but as soon as coal consumption at power plants and refineries returned to normal levels due to the resumption of their work, pollution levels returned to their previous level. The levels of CO and NO2 showed the most significant decrease (20 and 30%), since they were mainly associated with a decrease in economic growth and transport restrictions that led to a change in energy consumption and a reduction in emissions. This study can complement the scientific community and environmental protection policy makers, not only to assess the impact of outbreak on air quality, but also for its effectiveness as a simple alternative program of action to improve air quality.

TI  - Mapping of<i>Eucalyptus</i>in Natura 2000 Areas Using Sentinel 2 Imagery and Artificial Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantations of fast-growingEucalyptustrees have become a common sight in the western Iberian peninsula where they are planted to exploit their economic potential. Negative side-effects of large scale plantations including the invasive behavior ofEucalyptustrees outside of regular plantations have become apparent. This study uses medium resolution, multi-spectral imagery of the Sentinel 2 satellites to mapEucalyptusacross Portugal and parts of Spain with a focus on Natura 2000 areas inside Portugal, that are protected under the European birds and habitats directives. This method enables the detection of small incipient as well as mixed populations outside of regular plantations. Ground truth maps were compiled using field surveys as well as high resolution satellite imagery and were used to train Feedforward Neural Networks. These models predictEucalyptustree cover with a sensitivity of up to 75.7% as well as a specificity of up to 95.8%. The overall accuracy of the prediction is 92.5%. A qualitative assessment of Natura 2000 areas in Portugal has been performed and 15 areas have been found to be affected byEucalyptusof which 9 are strongly affected. This study demonstrates the applicability of multi-spectral imagery for tree-species classification and invasive species control. It provides a probability-map ofEucalyptustree cover for the western Iberian peninsula with 10 m spatial resolution and shows the need for monitoring ofEucalyptusin protected areas.

TI  - Quantifying Land Cover Changes in a Mediterranean Environment Using Landsat TM and Support Vector Machines
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid advent in geoinformation technologies, such as Earth Observation (EO) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS), has made it possible to observe and monitor the Earth's environment on variable geographical scales and analyze those changes in both time and space. This study explores the synergistic use of Landsat EO imagery and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in obtaining Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping and quantifying its spatio-temporal changes for the municipality of Mandra-Idyllia, Attica Region, Greece. The study area is representative of typical Mediterranean landscape in terms of physical structure and coverage of species composition. Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) images from 1993, 2001 and 2010 were acquired, pre-processed and classified using the SVMs classifier. A total of nine basic classes were established. Eight spectral band ratios were created in order to incorporate them in the initial variables of the image. For validating the classification, in-situ data were collected for each LULC type during several field surveys that were conducted in the area. The overall classification accuracy for 1993, 2001 and 2010 Landsat images was reported as 89.85%, 91.01% and 90.24%, respectively, and with a statistical factor (K) of 0.96, 0.89 and 0.99, respectively. The classification results showed that the total extent of forests within the studied period represents the predominant LULC, despite the intense human presence and its impacts. A marginal change happened in the forest cover from 1993 to 2010, although mixed forest decreased significantly during the studied period. This information is very important for future management of the natural resources in the studied area and for understanding the pressures of the anthropogenic activities on the natural environment. All in all, the present study demonstrated the considerable promise towards the support of geoinformation technologies in sustainable environmental development and prudent resource management.

TI  - Merkel cell carcinoma: Clinical and anatomopathological features, management and survival in our centre
T2  - CIRUGIA Y CIRUJANOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To summarize the features of the Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and to sistematyze its diagnosis and therapeutic management. Method: We performed a literature review in PubMed, obtaining a total of 3,308 articles, selecting 10 for its complete reading and 22 for the reading of the summary according to the content. Results: In none of our patients, the MCC was the first suspected diagnosis. The treatment consisted in surgical excision with tumor free margins and lymphadenectomy. We offered ad-juvant RT which they rejected. They remain disease-free at the present time. Conclusions: MCC is a rare and aggressive disease which presents as a fast-growing solitary asymptomatic erythematous nodule in those areas of skin which are exposed to sunlight in elderly patients. The main risk factors include radiative ultraviolet, immunosuppression and merkel cell polyomavirus. Surgery is the main loco-regional treatment. Lymph node metastases in the course of the disease is one of the main prognostic factors. If there are no adenopaties, sentinel lymph node biopsy must be done; if there are adenopaties or a positive biopsy, lymphadenectomy is indicated. Radiotherapy is indicated in all stages of disease since it has shown to improve loco-regional control. In distant metastatic disease, immunotherapy and participating in clinical trials are the first choice.

TI  - Screening of insecticide resistance in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> populations collected from parishes in Eastern Jamaica
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the increased reports in Aedes-borne diseases in the Caribbean and Latin America, the United States Agency for International Development assisted the Jamaican Ministry of Health and Wellness in conducting insecticide susceptibility tests onAedes aegyptipopulations. Sentinel sites were established in seven parishes of Jamaica (St. Catherine, Kingston and St. Andrew, St. Thomas, Portland, St. Mary and St. Ann) andAedes aegyptieggs were collected, reared to adults per collected population and their susceptibility to varying pyrethroids and organophosphates were tested using the World Health Organization paper bioassays for these insecticides. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bottle bioassay was used to assess susceptibility to the carbamate, bendiocarb. The voltage gated sodium channel gene mutationsV1016IandI1011V, normally associated with pyrethroid resistance, were also analysed. The results showed thatAedes aegypticollected from all parishes exhibited resistance to pyrethroids at the following concentrations, permethrin 0.25-2.5%; deltamethrin 0.03-0.15%; lambda-cyhalothrin 0.03-0.3%; and etofenprox 0.5-2.5%. The insecticide deltamethrin at concentration 0.3% was the only pyrethroid tested that resulted in high mortality, 94.9 +/- 0.34% knockdown within 1 hour of exposure and 98.95 +/- 0.01% mortality (p<0.01) at 24 hours post exposure. The frequency of the voltage gated sodium channel gene mutationV1016Iwas high in the tested population, possibly accounting for the reduced sensitivity to pyrethroids. Organophosphate resistance was also observed in all populations tested. Mortality rates for 0.8% Malathion was 0.8 +/- 0.02-60.68 +/- 0.01% after 24 hour and 0.00-47.10 +/- 0.09%, for pirimiphos-methyl 0.21%. Bendiocarb applied as 12.5 mu g/ bottle resulted in mortality rates of 76.25 +/- 4.30-100 +/- 0.00% after 30 minutes of exposure. The results showed thatAe.aegyptifrom the seven parishes analysed demonstrated resistance to the insecticides tested. Deltamethrin and bendiocarb at concentrations 0.3% and 12.5 mu g respectively, were considered most effective, causing high mortality in the local populations. Routine monitoring and evaluations ofAe.aegyptipopulations from the included parishes are recommended. Additionally, the study results represent the most comprehensive testing to date with localAedes aegyptipopulations distributed across different parishes of Jamaica and should be useful to guide national and sub national strategies for vector control and surveillance.Author summary The recent outbreaks of chikungunya, Zika and dengue viruses in the Caribbean and Latin America during 2013-2018, have motivated local health authorities in individual countries to seek international assistance from multiple agencies and adjust their vector management strategies in order to contain the transmission of Aedes-borne diseases. Countries within the region rely mainly on the use of commercially available insecticides to manage the mosquito populations and by extension, reduce the transmission of vector-borne diseases. However, this practice is stymied by the ability of these insects to develop resistance mechanisms to insecticides of frequent use. Many countries in the Caribbean and Latin America regions lack the facilities and supplies to conduct routine insecticide susceptibility testing. In an effort to ascertain knowledge on the presence of insecticide resistance inAedes aegyptipopulations, and to determine which insecticide is more effective to reduce vector populations of Jamaica, we conducted an array of bioassays with three different types of insecticides (pyrethroid, organophosphate, carbamate) to use local evidence and inform public health authorities on vector control status and alternatives.

TI  - Breaking ground: Automated disturbance detection with Landsat time series captures rapid refugee settlement establishment and growth in North Uganda
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2015, Uganda has welcomed over 700,000 refugees from South Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, and other East African nations, and currently hosts over 1.4 million refugees with 92% of that population living in UNHCR-managed settlements. Despite refugee settlements being essential spaces for physical protection and humanitarian aid distribution and reception, the sheer rate of refugee influx and settlement growth has introduced uncertainties around site planning, aid delivery, food security, and landscape change. For example, there is little publicly available information on settlement establishment, growth, or changes in land use/land cover for the vast majority of UNHCR-managed settlements in Uganda and around the world. To address this shortcoming, this research characterizes the spatial and temporal patterns of refugee settlement landscape dynamics using the case study of the Pagirinya Refugee Settlement in Northern Uganda, Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite image time series, and BFAST, an automated land cover disturbance detection algorithm. To delineate the extent of the settlement and surrounding disturbance, a refugee settlement boundary was generated using a 2018 Landsat NDVI composite, which included land disturbed by settlement establishment and subsequent growth. Landsat time series data were sampled within this boundary to parametrize a BFAST model to detect settlement disturbance, which was deployed over 351 Landsat images from 2005 to 2018. This approach yielded sub-monthly land cover disturbances from 2016 to 2017 with an accuracy of 87.5% resulting from the rapid (within one month) settlement establishment, road construction, the spread of dwellings and other built-up infrastructure throughout the settlement, as well as the conversion of natural grassland to small-scale agriculture within the first six months after refugee settlement began. These results were generated using open-access data and open-source algorithms to pave the way for developing a near real-time satellite image-based settlement monitoring framework, which would aid refugee response and evaluation efforts that are central to Uganda's refugee hosting and settlement plans, as well as implementation of the Global Compact on Refugees.

TI  - Impacts of Regional Groundwater Flow and River Fluctuation on Floodplain Wetlands in the Middle Reach of the Yellow River
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Floodplain wetlands are of great importance in the entire river and floodplain ecosystems. Understanding the hydrological processes of floodplain wetlands is fundamental to study the changes in wetlands caused by climate change and human activities. In this study, floodplain wetlands along the middle reach of the Yellow River were selected as a study area. The hydrological processes and the interactions between the river and the underlying aquifer were investigated by combining remote sensing, hydraulic monitoring, and numerical modeling. Wetland areas from 2014 to 2019 were extracted from Landsat 8 remote sensing images, and their correlation with the river runoff was analyzed. The results indicate that the river flow had a limited impact on the wetland size and so did groundwater levels, due to the strong reliance of wetland vegetation on water levels. Based on hydrological and hydrogeological conditions, a surface water-groundwater coupled numerical model was established. The comparison and correlation analysis between the monitored groundwater head and the simulated river stage also show that river flow did not play a first-order role in controlling the groundwater levels of wetlands in the study area. The simulation results also suggest that it is the regional groundwater flow that mainly sustains shallow groundwater of floodplain wetlands in the study area. The floodplain wetland of the study area was dynamic zones between the regional groundwater and river, the contrasting pattern of hydrological regimes on both banks of the Yellow River was due to a combination of regional groundwater flow and topography.

TI  - Lymph node retrieval after colorectal cancer surgery: a comparative study of the efficacy between the conventional manual method and a new fat dissolution method
T2  - SURGERY TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This study compared the efficacy of two different methods for lymph node (LN) searching after colorectal cancer surgery: the fat dissolution and the conventional manual method. Methods For the fat dissolution method, we used a commercially available solution of collagenase and lipase (FD group). The primary endpoint was the number of identified LNs in the FD group compared to an historical control (control group) after adjusting by propensity score matching. Results Using 37 matched patients from each group, we identified 20.6 +/- 7.2 LNs using the fat dissolution method compared to 13.5 +/- 5.9 using the conventional method (ttest,P < 0.01). Three patients in the FD group received an inappropriate LN examination in terms of number, while the number of the retrieved LNs was < 12 in 12 patients in the control group. The mean diameter of LNs without metastasis was 3.2 +/- 1.9 mm in the FD group, and 40% of metastasis cases were found in LNs < 5 mm in diameter. A pathological examination confirmed that using the fat resolution method did not change the morphological or immunochemical staining findings. Conclusion We demonstrated that fat dissolution had a positive impact on the number of retrieved LNs after colorectal cancer surgery without disturbing the microscopic observation.

TI  - Estimating soil moisture using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 sensors for dryland and palustrine wetland areas
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) plays an important role in the hydrological functioning of wetlands. Remote sensing shows potential for the quantification and monitoring of the SMC of palustrine wetlands; however, this technique remains to be assessed across a wetland-terrestrial gradient in South Africa. The ability of the Sentinel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical sensors, which are freely available from the European Space Agency, were evaluated to predict SMC for a palustrine wetland and surrounding terrestrial areas in the grassland biome of South Africa. The percentage of volumetric water content (%VWC) was measured across the wetland and terrestrial areas of the Colbyn Wetland Nature Reserve, located in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality of the Gauteng Province, using a handheld SMT-100 soil moisture meter at a depth of 5 cm during the peak and end of the hydroperiod in 2018. The %VWC was regressed against the Sentinel imagery, using random forest, simple linear and support vector machine regression models. Random forest yielded the highest prediction accuracies in comparison to the other models. The results indicate that the Sentinel images have the potential to be used to predict SMC with a high coefficient of determination (Sentinel-1 SAR = R-2>0.9; Sentinel-2 optical = R-2>0.9) and a relatively low root mean square error (Sentinel-1 RMSE = <17%; Sentinel-2 optical = RMSE <21%). Predicted maps show higher ranges of SMC for wetlands (> 50%VWC; p<0.05) compared to terrestrial areas, and therefore SMC monitoring may benefit the inventorying of wetlands, as well as monitoring of their extent and ecological condition.Significance:The freely available and space-borne Sentinel sensors show potential for the quantification of surface soil moisture across a wetland-terrestrial gradient.Significant differences between the surface soil moisture of palustrine wetlands and terrestrial areas, imply that inventorying and monitoring of the extent and hydroperiod of palustrine wetlands can potentially be done.

TI  - A New Crop Classification Method Based on the Time-Varying Feature Curves of Time Series Dual-Polarization Sentinel-1 Data Sets
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal Sentinel-1 data sets are suitable for high-precision agricultural classification mapping due to its short revisit period and dual-polarization channels. At present, more and more attention has been paid to the multitemporal classification methods with feature curve matching, because the time-varying polarimetric characteristics show great potential to crop classification. However, current methods only use the variation of single intensity feature, and the indicators for evaluating similarity have not considered the effect of the variable growing seasons of different parcels. Based on this, a new method with feature curve matching is proposed, which uses the combination of multiple features and applies the discrete Frechet distance and the Pearson distance to evaluate the similarity between two curves. The proposed method applies time-series Sentinel-1 images for crop classification in two study areas of Gansu province, China. The results show that the overall accuracies in two study areas of the proposed method are 94.98% and 90.20%, respectively. This method achieves higher classification accuracies, compared with the SVM classification method and some other methods with feature curve matching.

AB  - Ecosystem services refer to the environmental conditions and utilities provided and maintained by ecosystems, which are the basis for the survival and development of human society. The studies on ecosystem services in quantitative assessments, driving mechanisms, and correlation with human well-being, based on remote sensing, have increased in recent years. Various applications of remote sensing in ecosystem services are reported in six papers published in this Special Issue. The major research topics covered by this Special Issue include the multi-method analysis (e.g., linear regression, geographical detector, and geographically weighted regression methodology) of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to reflect ecosystem structure, the dynamic changing process of ecosystem services, and the determinants, which include a new image-analysis method based on a time series of a biophysical variable and the application of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) to analyze the spatiotemporal relationship between ecosystem structure and function and the comprehensive study on ecosystem function and service based on multi-source remote sensing data. The application of remote sensing data to ecosystem services research has the advantage of monitoring ecological structure and functions at multi-scales. Furthermore, the quantitative calculation of ecosystem services, based on remote sensing, can provide a scientific basis for enhancing land use optimization and sustainable development.

TI  - Evaluation of a Convection-Permitting Modeling of Precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau and Its Influences on the Simulation of Snow-Cover Fractione
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation is a critical input to land surface and hydrology modeling and prediction. Dynamical downscale modeling has added value to representing precipitation, when compared with the performance of coarse-resolution reanalysis and global climate models, over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Convection-permitting modeling (CPM) may even outperform dynamical downscale models (DDMs). In this study, 4-km CPM results were compared to 28-km DDM results for a snow season (1 October 2013-31 May 2014) over the TP. The CPM- and DDM-simulated precipitation, as well as three merged gridded precipitation datasets, were evaluated against in situ observations below 4800 m. The five precipitation datasets (CPM, DDM, CMFD, COPRPH, and TRMM) showed large differences over the TP with underestimation of TRMM and overestimation of CPM and DDM compared to observations. The most significant difference occurred in the Brahmaputra Grand Canyon. Given the substantial uncertainty in observed precipitation at high mountains, snow cover simulated by a high-resolution land data assimilation system was used to indirectly evaluate the above precipitation data using MODIS observations. Simulated snow-cover fraction was greatly underestimated using all the merged precipitation datasets. However, simulations using the DDM- and CPM-generated precipitation as input outperformed those using other gridded precipitation data, showing lower biases, higher pattern correlations, and closer probability distribution functions than runs driven by the merged precipitation. The findings of this study generally support the assumption that high-resolution CPM-produced precipitation has an added value for use in land surface and hydrology simulations in high-mountain regions without reliable in situ precipitation observations.

TI  - Corn Grain Yield Estimation from Vegetation Indices, Canopy Cover, Plant Density, and a Neural Network Using Multispectral and RGB Images Acquired with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Corn yields vary spatially and temporally in the plots as a result of weather, altitude, variety, plant density, available water, nutrients, and planting date; these are the main factors that influence crop yield. In this study, different multispectral and red-green-blue (RGB) vegetation indices were analyzed, as well as the digitally estimated canopy cover and plant density, in order to estimate corn grain yield using a neural network model. The relative importance of the predictor variables was also analyzed. An experiment was established with five levels of nitrogen fertilization (140, 200, 260, 320, and 380 kg/ha) and four replicates, in a completely randomized block design, resulting in 20 experimental polygons. Crop information was captured using two sensors (Parrot Sequoia_4.9, and DJI FC6310_8.8) mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for two flight dates at 47 and 79 days after sowing (DAS). The correlation coefficient between the plant density, obtained through the digital count of corn plants, and the corn grain yield was 0.94; this variable was the one with the highest relative importance in the yield estimation according to Garson's algorithm. The canopy cover, digitally estimated, showed a correlation coefficient of 0.77 with respect to the corn grain yield, while the relative importance of this variable in the yield estimation was 0.080 and 0.093 for 47 and 79 DAS, respectively. The wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), plant density, and canopy cover showed the highest correlation coefficient and the smallest errors (R = 0.99, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.028 t ha(-1), root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.125 t ha(-1)) in the corn grain yield estimation at 47 DAS, with the WDRVI index and the density being the variables with the highest relative importance for this crop development date. For the 79 DAS flight, the combination of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red edge (NDRE), WDRVI, excess green (EXG), triangular greenness index (TGI), and visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI), as well as plant density and canopy cover, generated the highest correlation coefficient and the smallest errors (R = 0.97, MAE = 0.249 t ha(-1), RMSE = 0.425 t ha(-1)) in the corn grain yield estimation, where the density and the NDVI were the variables with the highest relative importance, with values of 0.295 and 0.184, respectively. However, the WDRVI, plant density, and canopy cover estimated the corn grain yield with acceptable precision (R = 0.96, MAE = 0.209 t ha(-1), RMSE = 0.449 t ha(-1)). The generated neural network models provided a high correlation coefficient between the estimated and the observed corn grain yield, and also showed acceptable errors in the yield estimation. The spectral information registered through remote sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles and its processing in vegetation indices, canopy cover, and plant density allowed the characterization and estimation of corn grain yield. Such information is very useful for decision-making and agricultural activities planning.

M3  - Article
AB  - The paper investigates the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for intentional modification of Earth remote sensing data. A generative neural network that includes a special subnet for object boundary inpainting is considered. The network comprises two GAN: the first completes the object boundary, and the second repaints blank areas. Actual remote sensing data are used to test the generative network under consideration. The exemplar-based Patch-Match algorithm is taken as a reference for comparison purposes. The experimental results allow the conclusion that the approach is an effective tool for the intentional modification of large terrestrial area images in falsification of Earth remote sensing data.

TI  - Post-Disaster Recovery Monitoring with Google Earth Engine
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-disaster recovery is a complex process in terms of measuring its progress after a disaster and understanding its components and influencing factors. During this process, disaster planners and governments need reliable information to make decisions towards building the affected region back to normal (pre-disaster), or even improved, conditions. Hence, it is essential to use methods to understand the dynamics/variables of the post-disaster recovery process, and rapid and cost-effective data and tools to monitor the process. Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides free access to vast amounts of remote sensing (RS) data and a powerful computing environment in a cloud platform, making it an attractive tool to analyze earth surface data. In this study we assessed the suitability of GEE to analyze and track recovery. To do so, we employed GEE to assess the recovery process over a three-year period after Typhoon Haiyan, which struck Leyte island, in the Philippines, in 2013. We developed an approach to (i) generate cloud and shadow-free image composites from Landsat 7 and 8 satellite imagery and produce land cover classification data using the Random Forest method, and (ii) generate damage and recovery maps based on post-classification change analysis. The method produced land cover maps with accuracies >88%. We used the model to produce damage and three time-step recovery maps for 62 municipalities on Leyte island. The results showed that most of the municipalities had recovered after three years in terms of returning to the pre-disaster situation based on the selected land cover change analysis. However, more analysis (e.g., functional assessment) based on detailed data (e.g., land use maps) is needed to evaluate the more complex and subtle socio-economic aspects of the recovery. The study showed that GEE has good potential for monitoring the recovery process for extensive regions. However, the most important limitation is the lack of very-high-resolution RS data that are critical to assess the process in detail, in particular in complex urban environments.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 Induced Lockdown on Environmental Quality in Four Indian Megacities Using Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS-Derived Data and Mamdani Fuzzy Logic Modelling Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The deadly COVID-19 virus has caused a global pandemic health emergency. This COVID-19 has spread its arms to 200 countries globally and the megacities of the world were particularly affected with a large number of infections and deaths, which is still increasing day by day. On the other hand, the outbreak of COVID-19 has greatly impacted the global environment to regain its health. This study takes four megacities (Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Chennai) of India for a comprehensive assessment of the dynamicity of environmental quality resulting from the COVID-19 induced lockdown situation. An environmental quality index was formulated using remotely sensed biophysical parameters like Particulate Matters PM(10)concentration, Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Different Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Fuzzy-AHP, which is a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making process, has been utilized to derive the weight of the indicators and aggregation. The results showing that COVID-19 induced lockdown in the form of restrictions on human and vehicular movements and decreasing economic activities has improved the overall quality of the environment in the selected Indian cities for a short time span. Overall, the results indicate that lockdown is not only capable of controlling COVID-19 spread, but also helpful in minimizing environmental degradation. The findings of this study can be utilized for assessing and analyzing the impacts of COVID-19 induced lockdown situation on the overall environmental quality of other megacities of the world.

TI  - Nodular primary cutaneous melanoma is associated with PD-L1 expression
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In previous studies, patients with Stage III melanomas expressing PD-L1 in more than 5% of their neoplastic cells had improved recurrence-free survival with anti-PD1 adjuvant therapy. Objectives We examined PD-L1 expression as a possible biomarker of primary cutaneous melanomas in the vertical growth phase. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective study including 66 patients with invasive primary cutaneous melanomas. We assessed patient clinical and histopathological data and performed immunohistochemical assays with melanoma specimens from the patients to evaluate PD-L1, PD-1, CD3, CD8 and FoxP3 expression. Results We observed PD-L1 expression in 21% (14/66) of our samples, and this expression correlated with increased melanoma thickness (p = 0.002) and nodular-type melanoma (p = 0.001). After adjusting for tumor thickness using a logistic regression test, the association of PD-L1 with nodular-type melanoma persisted. Nodular-type melanoma was 6.48 times more likely to be positive for PD-L1 than other histological types (p = 0.014; 95% CI: 1.46-28.82). As expected, PD-L1 expression correlated with the number of PD-1-expressing cells in the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte population (p = 0.04). No correlation with PD-L1 was observed for age, sex, tumor site, skin phototype, ulceration status, sentinel lymph node status, metastasis development or survival. Regarding the immune profile of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of PD-L1-positive and -negative groups, no significant differences were observed in the numbers of CD3 +, CD8 + FoxP3-, CD8-FoxP3+ and CD8 + FoxP3+ cells by immunohistochemistry. Conclusion Nodular-type melanoma is associated with PD-L1 expression and may be a suitable candidate for adjuvant therapy of primary melanomas treated with immunotherapy.

TI  - Regenerative-The New Sustainable?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over time, sustainability paradigms have evolved from meeting human needs throughout time to improving human wellbeing and the viability of ecological systems. Regenerative sustainability (RS), the next wave of sustainability, includes and transcends these goals, aiming for thriving living systems in which whole-system health and wellbeing increase continually. A key difference between sustainability paradigms is the thinking underlying them, with regenerative sustainability based on a holistic worldview and paradigm, integrating recent understandings from science and practice, different ways of knowing, and inner and outer dimensions of sustainability necessary for systemic transformation. RS, practiced through regenerative development and design for over 50 years, aligns human consciousness and actions with living systems principles. When this alignment occurs, sustainable development goals are elevated to become regenerative development goals, with living systems principles and characteristics guiding the development of regenerative indicators and strategies made specific to a place through transformational co-creative processes. We should aim for regenerative sustainability because it offers holistic approaches based on how thriving living systems function, addresses the root causes of (un)sustainability, and is inherently more inspiring and motivational. Advancing regenerative sustainability will require fundamental shifts supported by more awareness and education, theoretical and practical development, leadership, empowering communities, and integrating spirituality.

TI  - Improved Crop Classification with Rotation Knowledge using Sentinel-1. and-2 Time Series
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leveraging the recent availability of accurate, frequent, and multimodal (radar and optical) Sentinel-1 and -2 acquisitions, this paper investigates the automation of land parcel identification system (LPE) crop type classification. Our approach allows for the automatic integration of temporal knowledge, i.e., crop rotations using existing parcel-based land cover databases and multi-modal Sentinel-1 and -2 time series. The temporal evolution of crop types was modeled with a linearchain conditional random field, trained with time series of multi-modal (radar and optical) satellite acquisitions and associated LPIS. Our model was tested on two study areas in France (>= 1250 km(2)) which show different crop types, various parcel sizes, and agricultural practices: .the Seine et Marne and the Alpes de Haute-Provence classified accordingly to a fine national 25-class nomenclature. We first trained a Random Forest classifier without temporal structure to achieve 89.0% overall accuracy in Seine et Marne (10 classes) and 73% in Alpes de Haute-Provence (14 classes). We then demonstrated experimentally that taking into account the temporal structure of crop rotation with our model resulted in an increase of 3% to +5% in accuracy. This increase was especially important (+12%) for classes which were poorly classified without using the temporal structure. A stark positive impact was also demonstrated on permanent crops, while it was fairly limited or even detrimental for annual crops.

TI  - CloudScout: A Deep Neural Network for On-Board Cloud Detection on Hyperspectral Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing demand for high-resolution hyperspectral images from nano and microsatellites conflicts with the strict bandwidth constraints for downlink transmission. A possible approach to mitigate this problem consists in reducing the amount of data to transmit to ground through on-board processing of hyperspectral images. In this paper, we propose a customConvolutional Neural Network (CNN)deployed for a nanosatellite payload to select images eligible for transmission to ground, calledCloudScout. The latter is installed on the Hyperscout-2, in the frame of the Phisat-1 ESA mission, which exploits a hyperspectral camera to classify cloud-covered images and clear ones. The images transmitted to ground are those that present less than 70% of cloudiness in a frame. We train and test the network against an extracted dataset from the Sentinel-2 mission, which was appropriately pre-processed to emulate the Hyperscout-2 hyperspectral sensor. On the test set we achieve 92% ofaccuracywith 1% ofFalse Positives (FP). The Phisat-1 mission will start in 2020 and will operate for about 6 months. It represents the first in-orbit demonstration of Deep Neural Network (DNN) for data processing on the edge. The innovation aspect of our work concerns not only cloud detection but in general low power, low latency, and embedded applications. Our work should enable a new era of edge applications and enhance remote sensing applications directly on-board satellite.

TI  - Surface desalinated layer distribution in the Kara Sea determined by shipboard and satellite data
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reports the propagation dynamics of the Kara Sea surface desalinated layer (SDL) during the summer and autumn seasons. We analysed shipboard measurements data collected in 2013-2018 and MODIS ocean colour data that correlated with the shipboard ones. We formulated a comparatively strict criterion to determine the SDL border based on satellite data. For that, we analyzed the shipboard flow-through measuring system data obtained while crossing the surface desalinated layer border. Further, we used a regional algorithm to process the satellite data and estimate the coloured dissolved organic matter absorption coefficient for the Kara Sea. The results demonstrate a significant effect of the wind regime on the interseasonal and interannual variability of the transformation of the SDL boundaries. The positions of the surface desalinated layer boundaries at different times during 2013-2018 are given. The obtained results are important for calculating the heat balance and analyzing the Kara Sea bio-productivity. (C) 2020 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Utility of regional nodal irradiation in Japanese patients with breast cancer with 1-3 positive nodes after breast-conserving surgery and axillary lymph-node dissection
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The utility of regional nodal irradiation (RNI) is being considered in cases of 1-3 axillary node metastases after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with axillary lymph-node dissection (ALND). Therefore, we examined the necessity of RNI by examining the sites of recurrences in cases at our institution. We retrospectively analyzed 5,164 cases of primary breast cancer between January 2000 and December 2014 at the Aichi Cancer Centre, identifying local and distant recurrences in 152 patients with primary breast cancer treated with BCS and ALND and who had 1-3 positive axillary nodes. All patients received whole-breast irradiation (WBI) and adjuvant systemic therapy with either chemotherapy or anti-endocrine therapy with or without anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 therapy. The present study excluded patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, T4 tumors or N2-3 nodes and distant metastasis. From the database of our institution, we identified 152 cases that met the defined criteria. The median follow-up period was 71 months (1-176). Isolated locoregional recurrences were found in three patients (2.0%) and were recurrent only in the breast. Only one patient had local lymph node recurrence with distant recurrence. The 10-year rates of isolated regional disease-free survival (DFS), DFS, and overall survival were 95.41, 89.50 and 96.75%, respectively, which was better compared with previous studies. We conclude that the addition of RNI to WBI is not necessary for Japanese patients who have 1-3 positive axillary nodes and ALND.

AB  - An indirect anthropometric study was conducted to find out whether neoclassical facial canons could be applied to the population of Brazilian white young adults. The study was based on standardized facial photographs of 689 women and 666 men aged 30 years +/- 6 months. The findings were compared to those observed for the North American Caucasian population. The frequency of 5 canons was assessed: facial thirds; interorbital width; nose and eye widths; mouth and nose widths; and face and nose widths. The assessed population showed the following ratios: tr-n > n-sn (96.01%), n-sn < sn-gn (95.90%), tr-n = sn-gn (42.06%), en-en < al-al (58.08%), en-en < ec-en (59.92%), ch-ch = 11/2 al-al (52.61%), and al-al = 1/4 zy-zy (56.67%). When compared to North American Caucasians, only tr-n/n-sn and n-sn/sn-gn were identical. In conclusion, neoclassical facial canons cannot be applied to the Brazilian population, but they could serve as parameters for application in clinical practice and in forensic sciences.

TI  - The Effect of Cold and Warm Anomalies on Phytoplankton Pigment Composition in Waters off the Northern Baja California Peninsula (Mexico): 2007-2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we report the response of phytoplankton community composition to cold and warm interannual events affecting the waters off the Baja California Peninsula from 2007 to 2016 based on data obtained from a single marine station (31.75 degrees N/116.96 degrees W). Included variables were satellite chlorophylla, sea surface temperature (MODIS/Aqua), upwelling intensity, and field data (phytoplankton pigments, inorganic nutrients, light penetration). Phytoplankton pigments were determined by high performance liquid chromatography, and CHEMTAX software was used to determine the relative contributions of the main taxonomic groups to chlorophylla. Our results confirm the decrease in phytoplankton biomass due to the influence of the recent Pacific Warm Anomaly (2014) and El Nino 2015-2016. However, this decrease was especially marked at the surface. When data from the entire water column was considered, this decrease was not significant, because at the subsurface Chla did not decrease as much. Nevertheless, significant changes in community composition occurred in the entire water column with Cyanobacteria (includingProchlorococcus) and Prymnesiophytes being dominant at the surface, while Chlorophytes and Prasinophytes made a strong contribution at the subsurface. Analysis of the spatial distribution of SST and satellite chlorophyllamade it possible to infer the spatial extension of these anomalies at a regional scale.

TI  - Forecasting Daily Wildfire Activity Using Poisson Regression
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires and their emissions reduce air quality in many regions of the world, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year. Smoke forecasting systems have the potential to improve health outcomes by providing future estimates of surface aerosol concentrations (and health hazards) over a period of several days. In most operational smoke forecasting systems, fire emissions are assumed to remain constant during the duration of the weather forecast and are initialized using satellite observations. Recent work suggests that it may be possible to improve these models by predicting the temporal evolution of emissions. Here, we develop statistical models to predict fire activity one to five days into the future using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite fire counts and weather data from ERA-interim reanalysis. Our predictive framework consists of two-Poisson regression models that separately represent new ignitions and the dynamics of existing fires on a coarse resolution spatial grid. We use ten years of active fire detections in Alaska to develop the model and use a cross-validation approach to evaluate model performance. Our results show that regression methods are significantly more accurate in predicting daily fire activity than persistence-based models (which suffer from an overestimation of fire counts by not accounting for fire extinction), with vapor pressure deficit being particularly effective as a single weather-based predictor in the regression approach.

TI  - "Ein poetischer Schleier":<i>Bildung</i>and Failed Conversion in Fanny Lewald's<i>Jenny</i>(1843)
T2  - GERMAN QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the intersection of literature and Christian-Jewish love in Lewald's 1843 novelJenny, whereBildungis both a medium to transcend the constraints of Jewish identity and a force reinscribing these constraints. Literature is the space in which the novel's protagonist, Jenny, falls for her Christian tutor and pursues conversion. In order to reconcile her secular worldview with the spiritual demands of conversion, Jenny attempts to encode Christian doctrine into a system of understanding shaped by her literary imagination and engagement withBildung. This strategy fails, ending her romance and reinforcing an identification with her father.Bildung, which in part propelled German Jews into the middle class, ultimately prevents Jenny from escaping her status as a Jewish woman. The Jewish daughter's secular education in conjunction with her romantic rebellion away from the Jewish family stages the limitations of-and anxieties toward-refashioning Jewish identity in the non-Jewish world.

TI  - Implementation and evaluation of WRF simulation over a city with complex terrain using Alos-Palsar 0.4 s topography
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Air quality modeling requires an accurate representation of meteorology, and in cities with complex topography, the performance of meteorological modeling can be improved by using an alternative global digital elevation model (GDEM) such as Alos-Palsar 0.4 s instead of the default elevation data. Bogota is a city with complex topography geographically located over the Andes Mountains at 2600 m.a.s.l. A reliable meteorological simulation model is critical for performing a suitable air quality modeling in any case of study. Previous researches have been developed using the standard Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) topography (GTOPO 30 s). These studies have been developed with different configurations for the representation of meteorology. The aim of this study is to evaluate Alos-Palsar 0.4 s topography with WRF, and two domain configurations with horizontal spatial resolutions up to 1000 m, to establish a reliable and accurate way to simulate the meteorology in the city of Bogota. The evaluation quantitative parameters: IOA,r(Pearson), RMSE, MGE, and MB were calculated for the quantitative evaluation of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and solar radiation. An additional evaluation using Taylor diagrams was performed. Spatial differences were identified in the same locations as well the differences between the elevation from Alos-Palsar 0.4 s and GTOPO30. The results and evaluation suggest that simulations based on Alos-Palsar 0.4 s topography lead to a significant improvement in the meteorology representation by WRF in a region with complex topography such as Bogota, Colombia.

TI  - The Surge of the Hispar Glacier, Central Karakoram: SAR 3-D Flow Velocity Time Series and Thickness Changes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hispar Glacier is a useful site for studying surge mechanisms. Prior to this study, only two-dimensional (2-D) flow velocities having low temporal resolution were available for this glacier, providing inadequate information about its surge evolution. In this study, 139 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from Sentinel-1A were used to obtain 3-D flow velocity time series for the Hispar Glacier during the recent surge (2014-2016). The 3-D flow velocities were sampled at an interval of 11 days, which is much greater than in previous studies. Besides, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) and two TanDEM-X images were used to determine glacier thickness changes prior to and following the recent surge. Combining the results and geomorphologic features, we deduced that the recent surge was because of saturated basal water pressure in the Yutmaru tributary. The mass from the Yutmaru tributary squeezed into the trunk and rapidly flowed downslope along the northern margin, generating strong normal pressure to the trunk mass. Pushed by the Yutmaru tributary, the trunk began to surge in September 2014. The flow velocity reached a first peak in May 2015 and then decreased in October 2015, as part of the basal meltwater ran off. However, basal meltwater accumulated again during the following 4 months, and correspondingly, the trunk accelerated again after October 2015. Finally, as kinetic energy was released and resisting force increased, the trunk became almost stagnant in August 2016. The surge mass was blocked downstream in the trunk by the mass transferred from the Kunyang tributary, and consequently, the glacier did not advance.

TI  - Estimating Near Real-Time Hourly Evapotranspiration Using Numerical Weather Prediction Model Output and GOES Remote Sensing Data in Iowa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the applicability of numerical weather prediction output supplemented with remote sensing data for near real-time operational estimation of hourly evapotranspiration (ET). Rapid Refresh (RAP) and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) systems were selected to provide forcing data for a Penman-Monteith model to calculate the Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) over Iowa. To investigate how the satellite-based remotely sensed net radiation (Rn) estimates might potentially improve AET estimates, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite derivedRn(GOES-Rn) data were incorporated into each dataset for comparison with the RAP and HRRRRn-based AET evaluations. The authors formulated a total of four AET models-RAP, HRRR, RAP-GOES, HRRR-GOES, and validated the respective ET estimates against two eddy covariance tower measurements from central Iowa. The implementation of HRRR-GOES for AET estimates showed the best results among the four models. The HRRR-GOES model improved statistical results, yielding a correlation coefficient of 0.8, a root mean square error (mm hr(-1)) of 0.08, and a mean bias (mm hr(-1)) of 0.02 while the HRRR only model results were 0.64, 0.09, and 0.04, respectively. Despite limited in situ observational data to fully test a proposed AET estimation, the HRRR-GOES model clearly showed potential utility as a tool to predict AET at a regional scale with high spatio-temporal resolution.

TI  - Maximizing Temporal Correlations in Long-Term Global Satellite Soil Moisture Data-Merging
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an existing combination approach that maximizes temporal correlations is used to combine six passive microwave satellite soil moisture products from 1998 to 2015 to assess its added value in long-term applications. Five of the products used are included in existing merging schemes such as the European Space Agency's essential climate variable soil moisture (ECV) program. These include the Special Sensor Microwave Imagers (SSM/I), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM/TMI), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Aqua satellite, the WindSAT radiometer, onboard the Coriolis satellite and the soil moisture retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) sensor onboard the Global Change Observation Mission on Water (GCOM-W). The sixth, the microwave radiometer imager (MWRI) onboard China's Fengyun-3B (FY3B) satellite, is absent in the ECV scheme. Here, the normalized soil moisture products are merged based on their availability within the study period. Evaluation of the merged product demonstrated that the correlations and unbiased root mean square differences were improved over the whole period. Compared to ECV, the merged product from this scheme performed better over dense and sparsely vegetated regions. Additionally, the trends in the parent inputs are preserved in the merged data. Further analysis of FY3B's contribution to the merging scheme showed that it is as dependable as the widely used AMSR2, as it contributed significantly to the improvements in the merged product.

AB  - The aim of this study is to estimate runoff in Wadi Ba Al Arid watershed for a period of ten years 2009-2018 by Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method in combination with the GIS techniques using remote sensing data. The used data are the daily rainfall data from NASA Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (POWER), digital elevation data (DEM) from ALOS PALSAR RTC, satellite imagery from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel, and soil data represented in soil maps of a scale 1: 50,000 and some local studies carried out by several Libyan institutions. The overall area of the watershed is about 136.4 km(2) and perimeter 107.3 Km. The watershed upstream and downstream is well recognized due to the topographical difference as a result of the tectonic geology. Soil maps were processed and classified into hydrologic soil groups (HSG), where the dominant HSG in the study area are C and D. The Landcover/Land use (LULC) was classified into five classes (forest, shrubs, agriculture, barren land) and built up. The HSG and LULC layers were intersected and the CN values and the weighted curve number for each Antecedent Moisture (AMC) condition were assigned. Furthermore, the runoff depth was estimated and the average runoff volume for ten years during 2009-2018 in the study area was estimated by 1.67 Mm(3) which represents 4.6 % of the observed average annual rainfall as 264.3 mm during 2009-2018. The rainfall-runoff relationship has shown a strong correlation with the value of 0.75.

TI  - Multi-Source Data Modeling of the Spatial Distribution of Winter Wheat Yield in China from 2000 to 2015
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Yield gridded datasets are essential for agricultural land management, food security and harmonious human-land relationships. Many studies have developed yield spatialization models that are based on cropland areas. However, crop planting areas, phenological dates, and net primary production (NPP) have received minimal attention. This study proposes a novel method to simulate winter wheat yields in China from 2000 to 2015 using crop phenological datasets, phenological observations, and NPP. The results showed that the NPP in the growing season and statistical yield showed a significant positive correlation (R-2= 0.93, p < 0.01). The mean prediction error of the gridded yield dataset was 12.01%. The relative errors of the gridded yield dataset for approximately half of the samples were between -10% and 10%. Furthermore, the yield distribution was high in the east and low in the west. The high yield was primarily concentrated in the North China Plain, while low yield was observed in eastern Gansu, central Shanxi, southern Hebei, and eastern Sichuan. From 2000 to 2015, the yield mainly showed an increasing trend in the study area, with the average rate of 0.17 t ha(-1)yr(-1), especially in the North China Plain. This study suggests that NPP is a key indicator to evaluate the yield of winter wheat. Furthermore, this method can be used to generate gridded yield maps along with providing credible and fundamental data for climate change and sustainable agricultural development.

TI  - High-Precision Soil Moisture Mapping Based on Multi-Model Coupling and Background Knowledge, Over Vegetated Areas Using Chinese GF-3 and GF-1 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a combined approach comprising a set of methods for the high-precision mapping of soil moisture in a study area located in Jiangsu Province of China, based on the Chinese C-band synthetic aperture radar data of GF-3 and high spatial-resolution optical data of GF-1, in situ experimental datasets and background knowledge. The study was conducted in three stages: First, in the process of eliminating the effect of vegetation canopy, an empirical vegetation water content model and a water cloud model with localized parameters were developed to obtain the bare soil backscattering coefficient. Second, four commonly used models (advanced integral equation model (AIEM), look-up table (LUT) method, Oh model, and the Dubois model) were coupled to acquire nine soil moisture retrieval maps and algorithms. Finally, a simple and effective optimal solution method was proposed to select and combine the nine algorithms based on classification strategies devised using three types of background knowledge. A comprehensive evaluation was carried out on each soil moisture map in terms of the root-mean-square-error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean bias (bias). The results show that for the nine individual algorithms, the estimated model constructed using the AIEM (m(v1)) was significantly more accurate than those constructed using the other models (RMSE = 0.0321 cm(3)/cm(3), MAE = 0.0260 cm(3)/cm(3), and PCC = 0.9115), followed by the Oh model (m_v5) and LUT inversion method under HH polarization (m(v2)). Compared with the independent algorithms, the optimal solution methods have significant advantages; the soil moisture map obtained using the classification strategy based on the percentage content of clay was the most satisfactory (RMSE = 0.0271 cm(3)/cm(3), MAE = 0.0225 cm(3)/cm(3), and PCC = 0.9364). This combined method could not only effectively integrate the optical and radar satellite data but also couple a variety of commonly used inversion models, and at the same time, background knowledge was introduced into the optimal solution method. Thus, we provide a new method for the high-precision mapping of soil moisture in areas with a complex underlying surface.

TI  - In Vivo Dual-Modal Photoacoustic and Ultrasound Imaging of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Using a Solid-State Dye Laser System
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is being actively investigated as a non-invasive and non-radioactive imaging technique for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. By taking advantage of optical and ultrasound imaging, PAI probes SLNs non-invasively with methylene blue (MB) in both live animals and breast cancer patients. However, these PAI systems have limitations for widespread use in clinics and commercial marketplaces because the lasers used by the PAI systems, e.g., tunable liquid dye laser systems and optical parametric oscillator (OPO) lasers, are bulky in size, not economical, and use risky flammable and toxic liquid dyes. To overcome these limitations, we are proposing a novel dual-modal photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging system based on a solid-state dye laser (SD-PAUSI), which is compact, convenient, and carries far less risk of flammability and toxicity. Using a solid-state dye handpiece that generates 650-nm wavelength, we successfully imaged the MB tube positioned deeply (similar to 3.9 cm) in chicken breast tissue. The SLNs were also photoacoustically detected in the in vivo rats beneath a 2.2-cm-thick layer of chicken breast, which is deeper than the typical depth of SLNs in humans (1.2 +/- 0.5 cm). Furthermore, we showed the multispectral capability of the PAI by switching the dye handpiece, in which the MB-dyed SLN was selectively highlighted from the surrounding vasculature. These results demonstrated the great potential of the SD-PAUSI as an easy but effective modality for SLN detection.

TI  - Early-season crop type mapping using 30-m reference time series
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Early-season crop type mapping could provide important information for crop growth monitoring and yield prediction, but the lack of ground-surveyed training samples is the main challenge for crop type identification. Although reference time series based method (RBM) has been proposed to identify crop types without the use of ground-surveyed training samples, the methods are not suitable for study regions with small field size because the reference time series are mainly generated using data set with low spatial resolution. As the combination of Landsat data and Sentinel-2 data could increase the temporal resolution of 30-m image time series, we improved the RBM by generating reference normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)/enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series at 30-m resolution (30-m RBM) using both Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, then tried to estimate the potential of the reference NDVI/EVI time series for crop identification at early season. As a test case, we tried to use the 30-m RBM to identify major crop types in Hengshui, China at early season of 2018, the results showed that when the time series of the entire growing season were used for classification, overall classification accuracies of the 30-m RBM were higher than 95%, which were similar to the accuracies acquired using the ground-surveyed training samples. In addition, cotton, spring maize and summer maize distribution could be accurately generated 8, 6 and 8 weeks before their harvest using the 30-m RBM; but winter wheat can only be accurately identified around the harvest time phase. Finally, NDVI outperformed EVI for crop type classification as NDVI had better separability for distinguishing crops at the green-up time phases. Comparing with the previous RBM, advantage of 30-m RBM is that the method could use the samples of the small fields to generate reference time series and process image time series with missing value for early-season crop classification; while, samples collected from multiple years should be further used so that the reference time series could contain more crop growth conditions.

TI  - The Landsat Burned Area algorithm and products for the conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Complete and accurate burned area map data are needed to document spatial and temporal patterns of fires, to quantify their drivers, and to assess the impacts on human and natural systems. In this study, we developed the Landsat Burned Area (BA) algorithm, an update from the Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) algorithm. Here, we present the BA algorithm and products, changes relative to the BAECV algorithm and products, and updated validation metrics. We also present spatial and temporal patterns of burned area across the conterminous U.S., how burned area varies in relation to the number of operational Landsat sensors, and a comparison with other burned area datasets, including the BAECV, Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS), GeoMAC, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD64A1.006 data. The BA algorithm identifies burned areas in analysis ready data (ARD) time-series of Landsat imagery from 1984 through 2018 using machine learning, thresholding, and image segmentation. Validation with reference data from high-resolution commercial satellite imagery resulted in omission and commission error rates averaging 19% and 41%, respectively. In comparison, validation with Landsat reference data had omission and commission error rates averaging 40% and 28%, respectively when burned areas in cultivated crops and pasture/hay land-cover types were excluded. Both validation tests documented lower commission error rates relative to the BAECV products. The amount of burned area detected varies not only in response to climate but also with the number of operational sensors and scenes collected. The combined amount of burned area detected by multiple sensors was larger than from any individual sensor, but there was no significant difference between individual sensors. Therefore, we used BA products from individual sensors to assess trends over time and all available sensors to compare with other existing BA products. From 1984 through 2018, annual burned area averaged 30,000 km(2), ranged between 14,000 km(2) in 1991 and 46,500 km(2) in 2012, and increased over time at a rate of 356 km(2)/year. Compared to existing burned area products, the new Landsat BA products identified 29% more burned area than the BAECV products (1984-2015), 183% more than the MTBS/GeoMAC products (1984-2018), and 56% more than the MCD64A1.006 products (2003-2018). The products had similar patterns of year-to-year variability; the R-2 values of linear regressions between annual burned area were > 0.70 with the BAECV products and the MTBS/GeoMAC products, but somewhat lower for the MCD64A1.006 product (R-2 = 0.66). The BA products are routinely produced as new Landsat data are collected and provide a unique data source to monitor and assess the spatial and temporal patterns and the impacts of fire.

T2  - ARIES-JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF WESTERN ESOTERICISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Arriving from recent research on western esotericism and worldview literature around 1900 this article investigates the poetics of German fin-de-siecle cosmogonic discourse by reading Hanns Horbigers so-called "Welteislehre" or Glazial-Kosmogonie (1912) and Rudolf Steiners "spiritual-scientific" writings, most of all his Akasha-Chronik (1904/08) and Geheimwissenschaft (1910). In focusing predominantly on the specific rhetorical and representational strategies involved in propagating and transmitting a knowledge of the universe and its respective origins, it can be seen that these projects not only both mask and reflexively embrace their epistemological limitations but also devote extensive effort to various textual and performative acts of beginning.

TI  - Can partisans be pluralist? A comparative study of party member discourse in France and Hungary
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICS & INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pluralist norms, which prescribe certain attitudes of openness and mutual respect for diverging views, have long been considered a central pillar of liberal democracy. While democratic theorists have championed these values, they have been conflicted as to the capacity of political parties to carry them. Partisanship is widely recognized as an essential institution of democratic regimes but it has also been traditionally associated with intransigence rather than tolerance. This paper investigates this theoretical debate from an empirical standpoint, asking whether partisans can be carriers of pluralist values. It relies on focus-group methodology and software-assisted textual analysis to evaluate the extent to which the discourse of 117 party members in two different national contexts, France and Hungary, resonates with the pluralist worldview. The results of this study provide key empirical insights into the nature of partisanship, demonstrating wide variations in the extent to which partisans uphold pluralist principles, but also their capacity to do so at a stringent level.

TI  - Population structure and genetic diversity of <i>Magnolia</i> <i>cubensis</i> subsp. <i>acunae</i> (Magnoliaceae): effects of habitat fragmentation and implications for conservation
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Genetic data on threatened plant populations can facilitate the development of adequate conservation strategies to reduce extinction risk. Such data are particularly important for species affected by habitat fragmentation such as Magnolia cubensis subsp. acunae, a Critically Endangered magnolia subspecies endemic to Cuba. Using genetic data from 67 individuals, we aimed to evaluate the effect of habitat fragmentation on two subpopulations in the Guamuhaya mountain range, in Topes de Collantes Protected Natural Landscape and Lomas de Banao Ecological Reserve. We characterize the structure and genetic diversity of these subpopulations, with the objective of managing their conservation more effectively. We used Landsat satellite images to determine land-cover types at the two locations and calculated indices of habitat fragmentation. For genetic analyses, we extracted DNA from the leaf tissue of individuals from the two subpopulations and used EL microsatellite markers to genotype them. We calculated heterozygosity, allelic richness and the F-statistics, to evaluate genetic variability. The montane rainforest in Topes de Collantes was most affected by habitat fragmentation, with smaller patches of more irregular shapes, compared to submontane forest at this location and both montane and submontane forests in Lomas de Banao. Genetic diversity was higher in Topes de Collantes, but we found no genetic differentiation between subpopulations. Our findings suggest the two subpopulations can be considered a single evolutionary unit and conservation entity. We propose to use individuals from both subpopulations for reinforcement to increase the overall genetic diversity of the subspecies.

AB  - In April 2009, Mexican, American, and Canadian authorities announced a novel influenza that became the first pandemic of the century. We report on lessons learned in Mexico. The Mexican Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan, developed and implemented since 2005, was a decisive element for the early response. Major lessons-learned were the need for flexible plans that consider different scenarios; the need to continuously strengthen routine surveillance programs and laboratory capacity and strengthen coordination between epidemiological departments, clinicians, and laboratories; maintain strategic stockpiles; establish a fund for public health emergencies; and collaboration among neighboring countries. Mexico responded with immediate reporting and transparency, implemented aggressive control measures and generous sharing of data and samples. Lessons learned induced changes leading to a better response to public health critical events.

TI  - Surgical training in gynecologic oncology: Past, present, future
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to review the surgical care related to training in gynecologic oncology, from past, present and future perspectives. A marked decline in the incidence of cervical cancer as well as improvements in radiation therapy have led to a reduction in the numbers of radical hysterectomies and exenterations being performed. Utilization of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is reducing the extent of cytoreductive operations, including intestinal surgery. The incorporation of sentinel lymphatic mapping has reduced the number of pelvic, paraaortic and inguinal lymphadenectomies being performed. Coupled with these changes are other factors limiting time for surgical training including an explosion in targeted anticancer therapies and more individualized options beyond simple cytotoxic therapy. With what is likely to be a sustained impact on training, gynecologic oncologists will still provide a broad range of care for women with gynecologic cancer but may be quite limited in surgical scope and rely on colleagues from other surgical disciplines. Enhancement of surgical training by off-service rotations, simulation, attending advanced surgical training courses and/or a longer duration of training are currently incorporated into some programs. Programs must ensure that fellows take full advantage of the clinical materials available, particularly those related to the potential deficiencies described. Changing required research training to an additional elective year could also be considered. Based on the perspectives noted, we believe it is time for our subspecialty to reevaluate its scope of surgical training and practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A New Method of De-Aliasing Large-Scale High-Frequency Barotropic Signals in the Mediterranean Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of satellite observation technology, higher resolution and shorter return cycle have also placed higher demands on satellite data processing. The non-tide high-frequency barotropic oscillation in the marginal sea produces large aliasing errors in satellite altimeter observations. In previous studies, the satellite altimeter aliasing correction generally relied on a few bottom pressure data or the model data. Here, we employed the high-frequency tide gauge data to extract the altimeter non-tide aliasing correction in the west Mediterranean Sea. The spatial average method and EOF analysis method were adopted to track the high-frequency oscillation signals from 15 tide gauge records (TGs), and then were used to correct the aliasing errors in the Jason-1 and Envisat observations. The results showed that the EOF analysis method is better than the spatial average method in the altimeter data correction. After EOF correction, 90% of correlation (COR) between TG and sea level of Jason-1 has increased similar to 5%, and similar to 3% increase for the Envisat sea level; for the spatial average correction method, only similar to 70% of Jason-1 and Envisat data at the TGs location has about 2% increase in correlation. The EOF correction reduced the average percentage of error variance (PEL) by similar to 30%, while the spatial average correction increased the average percentage of PEL by similar to 20%. After correction by the EOF method, the altimeter observations are more consistent with the distribution of strong currents and eddies in the west Mediterranean Sea. The results prove that the proposed EOF method is more effective and accurate for the non-tide aliasing correction.

CP  - Annual Meeting of the Society-of-Asian-Academic-Surgeons (SAAS)

AB  - Background: Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is one of the four major subtypes in cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). We aimed to study the incidence and survival of ALM in the United States in recent 10 y and compare the survival between ALM and nonacral CMM. In the meantime, racial disparity and prognostic factors associated with survival were investigated.Methods: All the cases of ALM registered in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry from 2006 to 2015 were retrieved, including non-Hispanic whites (NHW), black Americans (blacks), Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic whites. Age-adjusted incidence was calculated. Clinicopathologic data, including age, gender, race, geographic location, Breslow thickness, ulceration, pathologic staging, sentinel lymph node status, and surgical approach, were collected and analyzed. Melanoma-specific survival (MSS) was analyzed in patients with ALM and CMM. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the influence of clinicopathologic data on ALM MSS. Only cases with complete staging and active follow-up were included in prognostic factor analysis.Results: A total of 1724 ALM and 87,442 nonacral CMM patients were included in the study. For ALM patients, the age-adjusted incidence rate was 2.0 per million person-years. The proportion of ALM among all melanoma subtypes was greatest in blacks (32.6%). The 5-y MSS rates of ALM were lower than CMM overall (80.6% versus 93.0%, P < 0.001, respectively). When controlled by stage, the difference was significant in patients diagnosed at stages I and III. ALM 5-y MSS rates were highest (84.3%) in NHW, intermediate in Asian/Pacific Islanders (76.6%), Hispanic white (72.0%), and lowest in blacks (66.9%). Blacks were elderly, male predominant, located in East and Middle American, and had thicker, more ulcerated, advanced disease as compared with NHWs. When controlled by stage, survival difference was significant between NHWs and blacks in stage I (P = 0.004) and stage III (P = 0.005) patients. Gender, race, sentinel lymph node status, and pathologic stage were identified as independent risk factors in multivariate analysis.Conclusions: The incidence of ALM has been steady in recent 10 y and more prevalent in aged people. ALM is associated with a worse prognosis than CMM. Black Americans have the worst prognosis, and survival difference is significant between NHW and blacks. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Rapid Flood Mapping and Evaluation with a Supervised Classifier and Change Detection in Shouguang Using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 Optical Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid flood mapping is crucial in hazard evaluation and forecasting, especially in the early stage of hazards. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are able to penetrate clouds and heavy rainfall, which is of special importance for flood mapping. However, change detection is a key part and the threshold selection is very complex in flood mapping with SAR. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to rapidly map flood regions and estimate the flood degree, avoiding the critical step of thresholding. It converts the change detection of thresholds to land cover backscatter classifications. Sentinel-1 SAR images are used to get the land cover backscatter classifications with the help of Sentinel-2 optical images using a supervised classifier. A pixel-based change detection is used for change detection. Backscatter characteristics and variation rules of different ground objects are essential prior knowledge for flood analysis. SAR image classifications of pre-flood and flooding periods both take the same input to make sense of the change detection between them. This method avoids the inaccuracy caused by a single threshold. A case study in Shouguang is tested by this new method, which is compared with the flood map extracted by Otsu thresholding and normalized difference water index (NDWI) methods. The results show that our approach can identify the flood beneath vegetation well. Moreover, all required data and data processing are simple, so it can be popularized in rapid flooding mapping in early disaster relief.

TI  - Daily Continuous River Discharge Estimation for Ungauged Basins Using a Hydrologic Model Calibrated by Satellite Altimetry: Implications for theSWOTMission
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of state-of-the-art satellite altimetry has provided new prospects for integrating water surface elevation (water level) measurements with a hydrologic model for river discharge estimation, which is particularly suited for poorly gauged or ungauged basins. In this context, we explored the possibility of model calibration using Jason-2-derived water levels, followed by SWOT (the Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission)-like data (the combination of Landsat 5/8-derived at-a-section river widths and concurrent gauged water levels). Two types of empirical formulas designed specifically for altimetry-derived water levels and the joint use of water levels and river widths, respectively, were used to derive discharge, which was integrated with a hydrologic model (CREST-RS). Here we present results of estimating daily continuous river discharge in narrow rivers for the upper Brahmaputra River (UBR) and Lhasa River (LR) using the developed approach independent of in situ discharge measurements. Five scenarios were performed: (1) model calibration using the Jason-2-derived water levels and SWOT-like data in the UBR (scenarios I-III) and (2) model calibration using the SWOT-like data for the LR (scenarios IV-V). Results showed that model calibration using the Jason-2-derived water levels could provide reasonably well-constrained parameters for discharge estimation, with the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient (NSE) reaching 0.85 during 2003-2014. For the SWOT-like data, theNSEreached 0.85 for the UBR and 0.75 for the LR. This study highlights the potential of performing model calibration using satellite altimetry and SWOT-like observations, which paves the way to estimate river discharge for ungauged basins globally.

TI  - An automatic change detection method for monitoring newly constructed building areas using time-series multi-view high-resolution optical satellite images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatically monitoring newly constructed building areas (NCBAs) is essential for efficient land resource management and sustainable urban development, particularly in the rapidly urbanizing country of China. In this regard, time-series multi-view high-resolution optical satellite images can provide fine spatial details for clearly characterizing NCBAs, but this leads to great heterogeneity and complexity, owing to the high spectral variation, complicated imaging conditions, and different viewing angles. Moreover, to date, the vertical features and time-series information from these images have not been fully exploited for urban change detection. In this paper, our primary objective is to automatically detect the presence of NCBAs, and meanwhile, to investigate the feasibility of identifying their change timing using time-series multi-view ZY-3 high-resolution satellite images. To this aim, we propose an automatic change detection method consisting of three components: 1) firstly, we jointly use planar-vertical features to delineate the NCBAs; 2) object-based temporal correction is subsequently applied to improve the spatiotemporal consistency of the features; and 3) finally, a multi-temporal change detection model is used to simultaneously capture the NCBAs and the change timing. We applied the method on two urban fringe areas of Beijing (7 multi-temporal image sets) and Shanghai (7 multi-temporal image sets), respectively, which are cities that have been experiencing rapid urbanization. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method. For both study areas, the F-score values reached nearly 90% in terms of NCBA detection, and with respect to the change timing, the overall accuracies with a one-year tolerance strategy reached around 92%. The joint use of the planar-vertical features and the inclusion of multi-temporal images make the proposed method a promising approach for automatically providing the spatiotemporal information of NCBAs in practical applications.

TI  - Significance of a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy in staging for distant metastasis in breast cancer: are current guidelines relevant?
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION In breast cancer, early identification of distant metastasis changes management. Current guidelines recommend radiological staging in patients with a preoperative positive axilla; no guidelines address a preoperative negative axilla with subsequent positive sentinel lymph node biopsy. This study investigates whether current guidelines adequately identify distant metastasis in a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy population that had radiological staging.MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer between 1 January 2013 and 1 October 2017 with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy and subsequent radiological staging from a single unit were included. A systematic search identified relevant guideline criteria, against which patients were audited.RESULTS A total of 330 patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy were identified; 227 (69%) had radiological staging postoperatively with computed tomography (5.3%), bone scan (2.6%) and both (92%) which identified 8/227 (3.5%) patients had distant metastasis. Patients with distant metastasis (DMp) compared with those without distant metastasis (NDMp) were associated with poorly differentiated tumours (DMp 62% vs NDMp 28%; p = 0.037), high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DMp 75% vs NDMp 39%; p = 0.043) and increased mean invasive tumour size (DMp 37mm vs NDMp 24mm; p = 0.014). Binomial logistic regression did not identify any characteristics to predict distant metastasis in staged patients (chi-squared p = 0.162). Two guidelines used postoperative results to inform radiological staging decision; 68/227 (30%) of staged patients met these guideline criteria, five of eight patients with distant metastasis did not meet current guideline criteria for radiological staging.DISCUSSION Over 50% of patients with distant metastasis did not meet current guideline criteria for radiological staging and would have remained undiagnosed if current guidelines were followed. This study had an acceptable detection rate of 3.5% for distant metastasis. We therefore recommend radiological staging in all patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Forest degradation assessment of Ratargul Special Biodiversity Protection Area for conservation implications
T2  - FORESTIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest degradation is threatening the biodiversity of moist tropical forests since the beginning of their development. Bangladesh is losing its forests and associated biodiversity continuously due to forest-dependent livelihoods. The only freshwater swamp forest of the Ratargul Special Biodiversity Protection Area in Bangladesh is also very prone to degradation due to anthropogenic disturbance. This distinct swamp forest has unique biological diversity compared to other forest types. To assess its degradation and to propose implications for conservation, sentinel images with 10x10 m resolution were used. Also, field data were collected and analyzed. This research produced a map of forest cover change and outlined an area that can be used in restoration planning. Branch cutting, dry season overgrazing, illegal tree felling, fuelwood collection, trampling by tourists, and insect and disease epidemics were identified as causes of degradation. Functional conservation effort ensured by strong political will and area-specific forest protection regulation is essential for the conservation of last swamp forest and its remnant biodiversity. Community-based conservation approaches need to be applied for mass awareness regarding this ecosystem's value and its sustainability.

TI  - Hydrothermal Activity in the Southwest Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past two decades, the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Park Service have studied hydrothermal activity across the Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field (YPVF) to improve the understanding of the magmatic-hydrothermal system and to provide a baseline for detecting future anomalous activity. In 2017 and 2018 we sampled water and gas over a large area in the southwest YPVF and used Landsat 8 thermal infrared data to estimate radiative heat flow. Most of the thermal activity in this region is in close proximity to the Yellowstone Caldera boundary. Springs and fumaroles discharge from a variety of lithologies, including some of the youngest rhyolites in the YPVF. Gas compositions and helium isotope ratios of most samples resemble those in other parts of the YPVF. The waters have meteoric origins, and tritium was detected in several samples. Thermal waters from some areas have compositions that plot along a line connecting thermal and nonthermal water endmember compositions. The thermal water endmember equilibrated at 160 degrees C-170 degrees C, lower than waters in Yellowstone's geyser basins. Heat discharged by springs and fumaroles originates from within the Yellowstone Caldera and is transported laterally by advection, mainly along the base of rhyolite flows that cover the inferred caldera boundaries.Plain Language Summary The Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field has had three cataclysmic volcanic eruptions over the past similar to 2.1 million years. The youngest of these eruptions at 0.631 Ma resulted in the formation of the Yellowstone Caldera and was followed by several smaller eruptive episodes of large volume rhyolite flows up to similar to 70,000 years ago. The diversity of Yellowstone's hydrothermal system is unparalleled with more than 10,000 thermal features that have diverse chemical compositions. To improve the understanding of Yellowstone's magmatic-hydrothermal system and to provide a baseline for detecting future anomalous activity, we sampled water and gas in southwest Yellowstone and analyzed satellite-derived thermal infrared images. Most of the hot springs and fumaroles in the study area are near the Yellowstone Caldera boundary. The area is characterized by different rock types including some of the youngest rhyolites in Yellowstone. Whereas gas compositions mostly resemble those in other parts of Yellowstone, the chemical compositions of waters differ from those within the Yellowstone Caldera. The heat and gas discharged by springs and fumaroles originate from within the Yellowstone Caldera and are transported laterally, mainly along the base of rhyolite flows that cover the inferred Yellowstone Caldera boundary.

TI  - Temporal Trend of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> in Local Urban Parks of the Republic of Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes albopictus (Skuse) was first reported in the Republic of Korea in 1941 (Suwon, Gyeonggi Province). Recently, a mosquito-monitoring program was established in response to the potential development of autochthonous infections of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, to identify the regional characteristics of Ae. albopictus in Suwon. Daily collections of adult mosquitoes were conducted using Blackhole UV-LED traps and BG-Sentinel traps baited with octenol, carbon dioxide or both at five sites in Suwon (Sungkyunkwan University, Manseok, Seoho, Olympic, and Jungang parks) from 1 July to 1 November 2016. Based on the ecological cycle of mosquitoes, an estimated association between the daily mean temperatures [2 wk prior to the collection date (lag 2 wk)] and relative population abundance were developed using a generalized linear model. The overall proportion of female mosquitoes collected from all traps was 88.3%. Higher female trap indices were observed for mosquitoes collected at BG-Sentinel traps. Additionally, the BG-sentinel trap was more effective collecting Ae. albopictus. Culex pipiens (Coquillett) was the most frequently collected mosquito using UV-LED traps, followed by Ae. vexans nipponn (Theobald), Ochlerotatus koreicus (Edwards), Cx. inatomi (Kamimura and Wada), and members of the Anopheles Hyrcanus Group. Within a certain temperature range, daily mean temperatures 2 wk prior to the collection period was significantly associated with a maximum abundance of Ae. albopictus (P< 0.05) at 26.2 degrees C (95% confidence interval: 24.3-29.4 degrees C). The BG-Sentinel trap is an effective trap for monitoring relative population abundance of Ae. albopictus, and trap catches are significantly correlated with daily mean temperatures.

TI  - Combining Satellite Multispectral Imagery and Topographic Data for the Detection and Mapping of Fluvial Avulsion Processes in Lowland Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluvial avulsion is an important process in the dynamics of the riverscapes and plays a key role in the drainage network evolution in lowland areas, also influencing past and present social processes and economic activities. Crevasse splays represent significant geomorphological features for understanding the fluvial morphodynamics in lowland areas dominated by avulsion processes. Within wide floodplains characterized by very low elevation ranges, the detection and accurate mapping of crevasse splay morphology and features, such as crevasse channels, levees, and deposit, can be very challenging considering floodplain extension, anthropic impact on the natural channels network, logistic difficulties, and in some cases, climate conditions that prevent field work. This research aims at improving the detection and mapping of crevasse splays in lowland areas through the combination of different remote sensing techniques based on optical multispectral imagery and topographic data derived from satellite earth observation missions. The Lower Mesopotamia Plain (LMP) offers a unique opportunity to study the avulsion processes because it presents numerous examples of crevasse splays, characterized by different sizes and states of activity. Furthermore, in this area, a strong correlation exists between the formation and development of crevasse splays and the expansion of agriculture and early societies since the Early Holocene. Different supervised classification (SC) methods of Landsat 8 satellite images have been tested together with topographic analysis of the microrelief, carried out based on two different 1-arcsec DEMs (AW3D30 and GDEM2). The results of this study demonstrate that the combination of multispectral imagery analysis and topographic analysis of the microrelief is useful for discerning different crevasse elements, distinguishing between active and relict landforms. The methodological approach proved helpful for improving the mapping of erosional and depositional landforms generated by the avulsion process and, in the study area, provided the best results for the active landforms.

TI  - Impacts of a Major Mississippi River Freshwater Diversion on Suspended Sediment Plume Kinematics in Lake Pontchartrain, a Semi-enclosed Gulf of Mexico Estuary
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS satellite imagery and in situ water measurements were used to quantify inorganic sediment concentration (ISC) and, subsequently, sediment plume motion and evolution during the 2016 diversion of the Mississippi River through the Bonnet Carre Spillway (BCS) within Lake Pontchartrain (LP) estuary in Louisiana, USA. Satellite images revealed that sediment plume areal distribution was closely linked to BCS discharge rate. The plume flowed eastward along the southern LP coastline at an average speed of similar to 0.3 m s(-1) during the first week of the event and attained its maximum areal extent (similar to 1117 km(2); 68% of the total LP area) on 23 January. In an attempt to examine the plume kinematics and potential sediment resuspension impacts, wind information was also assessed. Following BCS closure, the prevailing wind direction, but not wind speed, corresponded to significant differences in LP ISC. LP was further subdivided into four separate quadrants to assess relationships between ISC within each quadrant to BCS discharge rate and winds. While the BCS was open, the plume's eastward motion was associated with a high correlation (r(2) = 0.93) between BCS discharge and ISC in the southeast quadrant. However, the weak relationship (r(2) = 0.42) between BCS discharge and ISC in the northwest quadrant was attributed to influences from other tributaries. These results will benefit future research regarding impacts of freshwater diversions on coastal and estuarine processes that are sensitive to sediment influx by providing a satellite-based sediment map time series that can be used to help validate numerical circulation and sediment transport models.

TI  - VIS-NIR, Red-Edge and NIR-Shoulder Based Normalized Vegetation Indices Response to Co-Varying Leaf and Canopy Structural Traits in Heterogeneous Grasslands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Red-edge (RE) spectral vegetation indices (SVIs)-combining bands on the sharp change region between near infrared (NIR) and visible (VIS) bands-alongside with SVIs solely based on NIR-shoulder bands (wavelengths 750-900 nm) have been shown to perform well in estimating leaf area index (LAI) from proximal and remote sensors. In this work, we used RE and NIR-shoulder SVIs to assess the full potential of bands provided by Sentinel-2 (S-2) and Sentinel-3 (S-3) sensors at both temporal and spatial scales for grassland LAI estimations. Ground temporal and spatial observations of hyperspectral reflectance and LAI were carried out at two grassland sites (Monte Bondone, Italy, and Neustift, Austria). A strong correlation (R-2> 0.8) was observed between grassland LAI and both RE and NIR-shoulder SVIs on a temporal basis, but not on a spatial basis. Using the PROSAIL Radiative Transfer Model (RTM), we demonstrated that grassland structural heterogeneity strongly affects the ability to retrieve LAI, with high uncertainties due to structural and biochemical PTs co-variation. The RENDVI783.740SVI was the least affected by traits co-variation, and more studies are needed to confirm its potential for heterogeneous grasslands LAI monitoring using S-2, S-3, or Gaofen-5 (GF-5) and PRISMA bands.

TI  - Extracting multilayer networks from Sentinel-2 satellite image time series
T2  - NETWORK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, modern Earth Observation systems continuously generate huge amounts of data. A notable example is the Sentinel-2 Earth Observation mission, developed by the European Space Agency as part of the Copernicus Programme, which supplies images from the whole planet at high spatial resolution (up to 10 m) with unprecedented revisit time (every 5 days at the equator). In this data-rich scenario, the remote sensing community is showing a growing interest toward modern supervised machine learning techniques (e.g., deep learning) to perform information extraction, often underestimating the need for reference data that this framework implies. Conversely, few attention is being devoted to the use of network analysis techniques, which can provide a set of powerful tools for unsupervised information discovery, subject to the definition of a suitable strategy to build a network-like representation of image data. The aim of this work is to provide clues on how Satellite Image Time Series can be profitably represented using complex network models, by proposing a methodology to build a multilayer network from such data. This is the first work to explore the possibility to exploit this model in the remote sensing domain. An example of community detection over the provided network in a real-case scenario for the mapping of complex land use systems is also presented, to assess the potential of this approach.

TI  - Remote Sensing Satellite Imagery and In-Situ Data for Identifying Geothermal Potential Sites: Jaboi, Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT-IJRED
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing makes it possible to map potential geothermal site for a large area effectively using thermal infrared. The purpose of the present research is to overlay ground temperature, resistivity and satellite retrieved temperature in identifying geothermal potential site in Jaboi, Sabang-Indonesia. The data of acquisition of the DEM imagery was January 3rd, 2009 and the Landsat 8 imagery is July 18th, 2017. The satellite data were applied to extract the land surface temperature and land classification across. Two supporting data in situ were used to validate the results from remote sensing. First dataset was ground temperature measurements with total 114 points and second dataset was vertical electrical sounding (VES) with total of 51 points. Satellite, VES and ground temperature data were processed and analysed using the Envi 5.3, PCI Geomatica 2016 and ArcMap 10.4. The results from each data were integrated to produce a map shows geothermal potential. Its integration produced four areas which were considered to have high geothermal potential. However, these areas vary in term of the clustering of the features of interest, for example lineament and drainage density of the area, high temperature in the surface area, fault existence and low resistivity subsurface. All the features must take into consideration to rank potential area which has higher potential. Finally, a map of geothermal potential across were successfully created as an insight for future reference. (c) 2020. CBIORE-IJRED. All rights reserved

TI  - Narrow-Margin Excision for Invasive Acral Melanoma: Is It Acceptable?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this retrospective review of 100 patients with primary invasive acral melanoma, we examined whether narrow-margin excision is warranted for acral melanoma. Patients treated with surgical margins recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (R-group) were compared to those treated with narrow margins (N-group). A total of 65 patients underwent narrow-margin excision. Positive margin status or local recurrence rarely occurred regardless of the excision margins, whereas fatal events frequently occurred, particularly among the patients with T4 melanoma. The mortality rates of N- and R-group with T1-3 melanomas were similar (1.36 and 1.28 per 100 person-years, respectively). However, patients with T4 melanoma treated with narrow-margin excision had a higher mortality rate (11.44 vs. 5.03 per 100 person-years). Kaplan-Meier analyses showed a worse prognosis in the N-group (p= 0.045) but this group had thicker Breslow thickness (4.21 mm vs. 2.03 mm,p= 0.0013). A multivariate analysis showed that Breslow thickness was an independent risk factor, but surgical margin was not a risk factor for melanoma-specific survival or disease-free survival. In conclusion, although we could not find a difference between the narrow-margin excision and recommended-margin excision in this study, we suggest following current recommendations of guidelines. Our study warrants the prospective collection of data on acral melanoma to better define the prognosis of this infrequent type of melanoma.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Significance: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is an important method for metastasis staging in, e.g., patients with malignant melanoma. Tools enabling prompt histopathological analysis are expected to facilitate diagnostics; optical technologies are explored for this purpose.Aim: The objective of this exploratory study was to investigate the potential of adopting multi-photon laser scanning microscopy (MPM) together with fluorescence lifetime analysis (FLIM) for the examination of lymph node (LN) tissue ex vivo.Approach: Five LN tissue samples (three metastasis positive and two negative) were acquired from a biobank comprising tissues from melanoma patients. Tissues were deparaffinized and subjected to MPM-FLIM using an experimental MPM set-up equipped with a time correlated single photon counting module enabling FLIM.Results: The data confirm that morphological features similar to conventional histology were observed. In addition, FLIM analysis revealed elevated morphological contrast, particularly for discriminating between metastatic cells, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes.Conclusions: Taken together, the results from this investigation show promise for adopting MPM-FLIM in the context of SLN diagnostics and encourage further translational studies on fresh tissue samples.

TI  - A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR CROP WATER REQUIREMENT ESTIMATION USING ADVANCED GEOSPATIAL TECHNIQUES
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - It is quite challenging to assess the crop water requirement with limited time and resources on a regional scale. The study focuses on developing a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for crop water requirement and to determine the efficacy of existing irrigation systems by utilizing advanced geo-spatial techniques. Selected region was Punjab province of Pakistan that covers a total area of 105227 sq.km . Reflectance based crop coefficient approach was used forcrop water requirement estimation. Various metrological, climatic, geographical vector layers and statistical data of irrigation supply along with satellite imageries were used for monitoring the crop health on 8-days periodic intervals for the summer (Khalif) season in the year 2018. For accurate quantification and mapping of crop water requirement, Landsat, MODIS and SPOT imageries were processed for crop classification, top of the atmosphere radiation calculation and actual and reference measurements, respectively. Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was calculated using Penman method leading to provide water demand and consumption by further calculations in each irrigation circle. The results show that the regions lying at the tail of the canal command area (CCA) facing higher water deficit. In addition, irrigation circles facing insufficient irrigation water supplies (upper and lower Jhelum canal, Pothoar region) also demonstrating higher crop water deficits. Comparing southern with northern parts of the province high water deficits observed in images in the year 2018, reflecting these regions are relatively hotter and receive less average precipitation. Similarly, high water deficit observed at northeast of the Punjab due to insufficient irrigation water supply. The results have been validated by comparing the water demand with the irrigation supply in each CCA, which provides the water being utilized other than irrigation sources to satisfy crop water needs. This study is quite effective in water budget estimation and mitigation of water scarcity issues.

TI  - Gudalur Spectral Target Detection (GST-D): A New Benchmark Dataset and Engineered Material Target Detection in Multi-Platform Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Target detection in remote sensing imagery, mapping of sparsely distributed materials, has vital applications in defense security and surveillance, mineral exploration, agriculture, environmental monitoring, etc. The detection probability and the quality of retrievals are functions of various parameters of the sensor, platform, target-background dynamics, targets' spectral contrast, and atmospheric influence. Generally, target detection in remote sensing imagery has been approached using various statistical detection algorithms with an assumption of linearity in the image formation process. Knowledge on the image acquisition geometry, and spectral features and their stability across different imaging platforms is vital for designing a spectral target detection system. We carried out an integrated target detection experiment for the detection of various artificial target materials. As part of this work, we acquired a benchmark multi-platform hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing dataset named as 'Gudalur Spectral Target Detection (GST-D)' dataset. Positioning artificial targets on different surface backgrounds, we acquired remote sensing data by terrestrial, airborne, and space-borne sensors on 20th March 2018. Various statistical and subspace detection algorithms were applied on the benchmark dataset for the detection of targets, considering the different sources of reference target spectra, background, and the spectral continuity across the platforms. We validated the detection results using the receiver operation curve (ROC) for different cases of detection algorithms and imaging platforms. Results indicate, for some combinations of algorithms and imaging platforms, consistent detection of specific material targets with a detection rate of about 80% at a false alarm rate between 10(-2)to 10(-3). Target detection in satellite imagery using reference target spectra from airborne hyperspectral imagery match closely with the satellite imagery derived reference spectra. The ground-based in-situ reference spectra offer a quantifiable detection in airborne or satellite imagery. However, ground-based hyperspectral imagery has also provided an equivalent target detection in the airborne and satellite imagery paving the way for rapid acquisition of reference target spectra. The benchmark dataset generated in this work is a valuable resourcefor addressing intriguing questions in target detection using hyperspectral imagery from a realistic landscape perspective.

TI  - Introducing a Hybrid Model SAE-BP for Regression Analysis of Soil Temperature With Hyperspectral Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMBIENT COMPUTING AND INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil temperature, as one of the critical meteorological parameters, plays a key role in physical, chemical and biological processes in terrestrial ecosystems. Accurate estimation of dynamic soil temperature is crucial for underground soil ecological research. In this work, a hybrid model SAE-BP is proposed by combining stacked auto-encoders (SAE) and back propagation (BP) algorithm to estimate soil temperature using hyperspectral remote sensing data. Experimental results show that the proposed SAE-BP model achieves a more stable and effective performance than the existing logistic regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR) and BP neural network with an average value of mean square error (MSE) = 1.926, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.962 and coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.910. In addition, the effect of hidden structures and labeled training data ratios in SAE-BP is further explored. The SAE-BP model demonstrates the potential in high-dimensional and small hyperspectral datasets, representing a significant contribution to soil remote sensing.

TI  - Exploring the Factors Controlling Nighttime Lights from Prefecture Cities in Mainland China with the Hierarchical Linear Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light data have been proven to be valuable for socioeconomic studies. However, they are not only affected by anthropogenic factors but also by physical factors, and previous studies have rarely examined these diverse variables in a systematic way that explains differences in nighttime lights across different cities. In this paper, hierarchical linear models at two levels of city and province were developed to investigate the nighttime lights effect on cross-level factors. An experiment was conducted for 281 prefecture cities in Mainland China using orbital satellite data in 2016. (1) There exist significant differences among city average lights, of which 49.9% is caused at the provincial level, indicating the factors at the provincial level cannot be ignored. (2) Economy-energy-infrastructure and demography factors have a significant positive lights effect. Meanwhile, industry-information and living-standard factors at the provincial level can further significantly increase these differences by 18.30% and 29.01%, respectively. (3) The natural-greenness factor displayed a significant negative lights effect, and its interaction with natural-ecology will continue to decrease city lights by 11.99%. However, artificial-greenness is an unreliable city-level factor explaining lights variations. (4) As for the negative lights effect of elevation and latitude, these become significant in a multivariate context and contribute lights indirectly. (5) The two-level hierarchical linear models are statistically significant at the level of 10%, and compared with the null model, the explained variances on city lights can be improved by 70% at the city level and 90% at the provincial level in the final mixed effect model.

TI  - Satellite verification of ultra-low emission reduction effect of coal-fired power plants
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, satellite data from five isolated power plants were used to explore the change local emissions levels belonged to the vicinity of the power plant before and after ultra-low emissions (ULE) retrofitted. Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations from Ozone monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite data were used to evaluate the emission changes of the power plants retrofitted by ULE technology. Meanwhile, the actual emission reduction effect of isolated power plants was evaluated by the OMI data. It was observed that the isolated power plants have shown obvious point source characteristics. The average annual SO2 emission reduction ratio of SZ, ZD, JJ, ND and BD power plants after ultra-low transformation is 43.7%, 56.9%, 29.0%, 34.6% and 26.8%, respectively, compared with that before the transformation, while the corresponding PBL-SO2 column concentration reduction ratio is 27.0%, 14.3%, 15.6%, 26.6% and 4.2%, respectively. The average annual NOx emission reduction ratio of the power plants after ultra-low transformation is 44.7%,79.3%,29.0%,73.2% and 29.8%, respectively, compared with that before the transformation, while the corresponding NO2 column concentration reduction ratio is 7.0%,27.2%,25.7%,8.9% and 5.6%, respectively. The trend of emission reduction before and after the ULE retrofitted of SO2 and NO2 column concentration by satellite observation is consistent with the calculated trend of emission reduction. Satellite observations have confirmed the emission reduction effect of ULE technology.

TI  - Development of Geo-KOMPSAT-2A Algorithm for Sea-Ice Detection Using Himawari-8/AHI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice is an important meteorological factor affecting the global climate system, but it is difficult to observe in sea ice ground truth data because of its location mainly at high latitudes and in polar regions. Accordingly, sea-ice detection research has been actively conducted using satellites, since the 1970s. Polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites are used for this purpose; notably, geostationary satellites are capable of real-time monitoring of specific regions. In this paper, we introduce the Geo-KOMPSAT-2A (GK-2A)/Advanced Meteorological Imager (AMI) sea-ice detection algorithm using Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data as proxy data. The GK-2A/AMI, which is Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)'s next-generation geostationary satellite launched in December 2018 and Himawari-8/AHI have optically similar channel data, and the observation area includes East Asia and the Western Pacific. The GK-2A/AMI sea-ice detection algorithm produces sea-ice data with a 10-min temporal resolution, a 2-km spatial resolution and sets the Okhotsk Sea and Bohai Sea, where the sea ice is distributed during the winter in the northern hemisphere. It used National Meteorological Satellite Center (NMSC) cloud mask as the preceding data and a dynamic threshold method instead of the static threshold method that is commonly performed in existing sea-ice detection studies. The dynamic threshold methods for sea-ice detection are dynamic wavelength warping (DWW) and IST(0)method. The DWW is a method for determining the similarity by comparing the pattern of reflectance change according to the wavelength of two satellite data. The IST(0)method detects sea ice by using the correlation between 11.2-mu m brightness temperature (BT11.2) and brightness temperature difference (BTD) [BT11.2-BT12.3] according to ice surface temperature (IST). In addition, the GK-2A/AMI sea-ice detection algorithm reclassified the cloud area into sea ice using a simple test. A comparison of the sea-ice data derived the GK-2A/AMI sea-ice detection algorithm with the S-NPP/visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) sea ice characterization product indicates consistency of 99.0% and inconsistency of 0.9%. The overall accuracy (OA) of GK-2A/AMI sea-ice data with the sea ice region of interest (ROI) data, which is constructed by photo-interpretation method from RGB images, is 97.2%.

TI  - Mapping the condition of macadamia tree crops using multi-spectral UAV and WorldView-3 imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Australia is one of the world's largest producers of macadamia nuts. As macadamia trees can take up to 15 years to mature and produce maximum yield, it is important to optimize tree condition. Field based assessment of macadamia tree condition is time-consuming and often inconsistent. Using remotely sensed imagery may allow for faster, more extensive, and more consistent assessment of macadamia tree condition. To identify individual macadamia tree crowns, high spatial resolution imagery is required. Hence, the objective of this work was to develop and test an approach to map the condition of individual macadamia tree crowns using both multi-spectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and WorldView-3 imagery for different macadamia varieties and three different sites located near Bundaberg, Australia. A random forest classifier, based on all available spectral bands and selected vegetation indices was used to predict five condition categories, ranging from excellent (category 1) to poor (category 5). Various combinations of the developed models were tested between the three sites and over time. The results showed that the multi-spectral WorldView-3 imagery produced the lowest out of bag (OOB) classification errors in most cases. However, for both the UAV and the WorldView-3 imagery, more than 98.5% of predicted macadamia condition categories were either correctly mapped or offset by a single category out of the five condition categories (excellent, good, moderate, fair and poor) for trees of the same variety and at one point in time. Multi-temporally, the WorldView-3 imagery performed better than the UAV data for predicting the condition of the same macadamia tree variety. Applying a model from one site to another site with the same macadamia tree variety produced OOB classification between 31.20 and 42.74%, but with > 98.63% of trees predicted within a single condition category. Importantly, models trained based on one type of macadamia tree variety could not be successfully applied to a site with another variety. The developed classification models may be used as a decision and management support tool for the macadamia industry to inform management practices and improve on-demand irrigation, fertilization, and pest inspection at the individual tree level.

TI  - Human Dignity or Social Contract as Normative Frameworks in Applied Ethics?
T2  - INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL FOR RELIGION AND TRANSFORMATION IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The enquiry whether human dignity as the translation of the biblical designation of the human person as imago Dei should continue to be the framework used to ground human rights and specify their realisation, is developed in five parts. The first identifies two understandings of dignity in the public realm, one inherent-transcendental, the other empirically verifiable. The second section compares the use of "dignity" in three traditions of Catholic Theological Ethics: virtue, natural law, and autonomy. In view of doubts whether theological anthropology should still be the primary location for expounding the meaning of imago Dei, the third section discusses attempts to absorb anthropology into ecclesiology. The modern history of reception of this biblical term by J.G. Herder is outlined in section four, before drawing conclusions from the previous enquiries for the question which language theological ethics should use in public discourse, imago Dei or dignity.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of drought and return periods over the East African region using Standardized Precipitation Index from 1920 to 2016
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - East African region is susceptible to drought due to high variation in monthly precipitation. Studying drought at regional scale is vital since droughts are considered a 'creeping' disaster by nature with devasting and extended impact often requiring long periods to reverse the recorded damages. This study assessed drought exceedance and return years over East Africa from 1920 to 2016 using Climate Research Unit (CRU) precipitation data records. Meteorological drought, where precipitation is the central quantity of interest, was adopted in the work. Standardize Precipitation Index (SPI) was used to study long term meteorological droughts and also to assess drought magnitude, frequency, exceedance probability and return years using Joint Probability Density Function (JPDF). Also, Mann-Kendall trend analysis was applied to precipitation and SPI to investigate the trend changes. Results showed that years with high drought magnitude ranged from 1920 - 22, 1926 - 29, 1942 - 46 and 1947 - 51 with values corresponding to 2.2, 3.2, 3.4 and 2.6, respectively while years with low drought magnitude ranged from 1930 - 31, 1988 - 89 and 2001 - 02 with values as 0.2, 0.12 and 0.15, respectively. The longest droughts occurred from 1926 - 29, 1937 - 41, 1942 - 46, 1947 - 51, 1952 - 56, and 1958 - 61 with values in years as 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, and 3 years, respectively, while the shortest droughts occurred in time period of 1 year and ranged from 1930 -31, 1964 - 65, 1979 - 80, 1981 - 82, 1983 - 84, 1988 - 89, 1991 - 92, 1993 - 94, 1996 - 97 and 2001 - 02. Also, it was demonstrated that probability of drought occurrence is high when severity is low and such droughts occur at short time intervals and not all severest drought took longer periods. The SPI trends indicate high positive (negative) pixels above (below) the zero-trend mark, indicating that drought prevails in both low and high elevation areas up to 2000 m. There was no direct link between ENSO and drought but arguably the association of drought in most El Nino and La Nina years suggests that the impact of ENSO cannot be ruled out since peak ENSO events occur during October to March periods which coincides with the short (SON) and long (MAM) rainy seasons of East Africa. The study is particularly relevant in being able to depict continuous and synoptic drought condition all over East Africa, providing vital information to farmers and policy makers, using very cost-effective method.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to investigate temporal evolutions of particulate matter (PM) concentrations and its association with the meteorology and aerosol optical depth (AOD) during autumn and winter of 2014-2017 at an urban city, Nanjing in the Yangtze River Delta, East China. The seasonal mean PM2.5 (PM10) was found maximum and minimum with 81.2 +/- 41.5 mu g m(-3) (135.6 +/- 57.1 mu g m(-3)) and 33.7 +/- 19.1 mu g m(-3) (65.8 +/- 34.5 mu g m(-3)) during winter and autumn seasons, respectively. Furthermore, the mean ratio of PM2.5/PM10 was around similar to 0.57 for the entire study period, with a lower contribution (0.53) in autumn and higher (0.60) in winter. However, the seasonal mean AOD(440), precipitable water vapor content, angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE(440)(-)(870)) was found maximum with 0.97 +/- 0.31, 1.58 +/- 0.80 cm, and 1.14 +/- 0.23 during autumn, and a minimum of 0.62 +/- 0.34, 0.60 +/- 0.27 cm, and 1.29 +/- 0.19 in winter, respectively. The potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) models revealed considerable long-distance transport of PM2.5 from north and northwest China. Besides, the concentration bivariate probability function (CBPF) revealed a significant contribution of PM2.5 occurred when the winds blown from southerly and northwesterly directions. The relationship between PM2.5 and meteorology found that PM2.5 concentration had a positive relationship with AQI, while negative correlations with the major meteorological parameters. A notable spatial heterogeneities and trends were observed in AOD and AE, with negative correlations (-0.5 to 0) in winter over East China.

TI  - Adjusting conventional FRAX estimates of fracture probability according to the recency of sentinel fractures
T2  - OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The risk of a recurrent fragility fracture is particularly high immediately following the fracture. This study provides adjustments to FRAX-based fracture probabilities accounting for the site of a recent fracture. Introduction The recency of prior fractures affects subsequent fracture risk. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of a recent sentinel fracture, by site, on the 10-year probability of fracture determined with FRAX. Methods The study used data from the Reykjavik Study fracture register that documented prospectively all fractures at all skeletal sites in a large sample of the population of Iceland. Fracture probabilities were determined after a sentinel fracture (humeral, clinical vertebral, forearm and hip fracture) from the hazards of death and fracture. Fracture probabilities were computed on the one hand for sentinel fractures occurring within the previous 2 years and on the other hand, probabilities for a prior osteoporotic fracture irrespective of recency. The probability ratios provided adjustments to conventional FRAX estimates of fracture probability for recent sentinel fractures. Results Probability ratios to adjust 10-year FRAX probabilities of a major osteoporotic fracture for recent sentinel fractures were age dependent, decreasing with age in both men and women. Probability ratios varied according to the site of sentinel fracture with higher ratios for hip and vertebral fracture than for humerus or forearm fracture. Probability ratios to adjust 10-year FRAX probabilities of a hip fracture for recent sentinel fractures were also age dependent, decreasing with age in both men and women with the exception of forearm fractures. Conclusion The probability ratios provide adjustments to conventional FRAX estimates of fracture probability for recent sentinel fractures.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: During HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) 2017 round, the sampling strategy to recruit female sex workers (FSWs) was changed from consecutive to random sampling. This may affect the participation and HIV positivity rates among FSWs. Objective: The objective of this study is to estimate the nonparticipation rates among FSWs and its effect on the observed HIV prevalence rate during HSS-2017. Methods: The data were collected from FSW sentinel sites located in the states of Delhi, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand (Central Zone). The HIV positivity rate among FSWs who participated in HSS-2017 was compared with the HIV positivity rate of those who did not participate. HIV status of the participants was obtained from HSS-2017 data. The master list of participating targeted intervention sites was accessed to obtain the last known HIV status of the eligible nonparticipants. Results: Nonparticipation rate of FSWs from the central zone during HSS2017 was 10.8%. The HIV positivity rate among nonparticipant FSW was four times and six times higher in Delhi and UP, respectively. Conclusion: Selective nonparticipation of eligible FSWs might have led to the underestimation of the HIV positivity rate in the central zone during the HSS-2017 round.

TI  - A review of remote sensing applications in agriculture for food security: Crop growth and yield, irrigation, and crop losses
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The global population is expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050. There is an exponential growth of food production to meet the needs of the growing population. However, the limited land and water resources, climate change, and an increase in extreme events likely to pose a significant threat for achieving the sustainable agriculture goal. Given these challenges, food security is included in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Since the advent of Sputnik, followed by the Explorer missions, satellite remote sensing is assisting us in collecting the data at global scales. In this work, we review how satellite remote sensing information is utilized to assess and manage agriculture, an important component of ecohydrology. Overall, three critical aspects of agriculture are considered: (a) crop growth and yield through empirical models, physics-based models, and data assimilation in crop models, (b) applications pertaining to irrigation, which include mapping irrigation areas and quantification of irrigation, and (c) crop losses due to pests, diseases, crop lodging, and weeds. The emphasis is on satellite sensors in optical, thermal, microwave, and fluorescence frequencies. We conclude the review with an outlook of challenges and recommendations. This paper is the first of a two-part review series. The second part reviews the role of satellite remote sensing in water security, wherein we discuss the aspects of water quality and quantity along with extremes (floods and droughts).

AB  - Although phase III trials have been published comparing whole breast irradiation (WBI) with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), long-term follow-up results are lacking. We report the 10-year follow-up results of a prospective phase I/II clinical trial of IORT. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) tumor size <2.5 cm, (ii) desire for breast-conserving surgery, (iii) age >50 years, (iv) negative margins after resection and (v) sentinel lymph node-negative disease. A single dose of IORT (19-21 Gy) was delivered to the tumor bed in the operation room just after wide local excision of the primary breast cancer using a 6-12 MeV electron beam. Local recurrence was defined as recurrence or new disease within the treated breast and was evaluated annually using mammography and ultrasonography. A total of 32 patients were eligible for evaluation. The median patient age was 65 years and the median follow-up time was 10 years. Two patients experienced local recurrence just under the nipple, out of the irradiated field, after 8 years of follow-up. Three patients had contralateral breast cancer and one patient experienced bone metastasis after 10 years of follow-up. No patient experienced in-field recurrence nor breast cancer death. Eight patients had hypertrophic scarring at the last follow-up. There were no lung or heart adverse effects. This is the first report of 10-year follow-up results of IORT as APBI. The findings suggest that breast cancer with extended intraductal components should be treated with great caution.

TI  - IrrMapper: A Machine Learning Approach for High Resolution Mapping of Irrigated Agriculture Across the Western US
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High frequency and spatially explicit irrigated land maps are important for understanding the patterns and impacts of consumptive water use by agriculture. We built annual, 30 m resolution irrigation maps using Google Earth Engine for the years 1986-2018 for 11 western states within the conterminous U.S. Our map classifies lands into four classes: irrigated agriculture, dryland agriculture, uncultivated land, and wetlands. We built an extensive geospatial database of land cover from each class, including over 50,000 human-verified irrigated fields, 38,000 dryland fields, and over 500,000 km2of uncultivated lands. We used 60,000 point samples from 28 years to extract Landsat satellite imagery, as well as climate, meteorology, and terrain data to train a Random Forest classifier. Using a spatially independent validation dataset of 40,000 points, we found our classifier has an overall binary classification (irrigated vs. unirrigated) accuracy of 97.8%, and a four-class overall accuracy of 90.8%. We compared our results to Census of Agriculture irrigation estimates over the seven years of available data and found good overall agreement between the 2832 county-level estimates (r2= 0.90), and high agreement when estimates are aggregated to the state level (r2= 0.94). We analyzed trends over the 33-year study period, finding an increase of 15% (15,000 km2) in irrigated area in our study region. We found notable decreases in irrigated area in developing urban areas and in the southern Central Valley of California and increases in the plains of eastern Colorado, the Columbia River Basin, the Snake River Plain, and northern California.

TI  - Land Use Change using Geospatial Techniques in Upper Prek Thnot Watershed in Cambodia
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of land use change is crucial for sustainable resource management and development planning. Up-to-date land use change information is important to understand its pattern and identify the drivers. Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) have proven as a useful tool to measure and analyze land use changes. Recent advances in remote sensing technology with digital image processing provide unprecedented possibilities for detecting changes in land use over large areas, with less costs and processing time. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the land use changes in upper Prek Thnot watershed in Cambodia from 2006 until 2018. Geospatial tools such as remote sensing and GIS were used to process and produce land use maps from Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8. The post-classification comparison was conducted for analysing the land use changes. Results show forest area was greatly decreased by 1,162.06 km(2) (33.67%) which was converted to rubber plantation (10.55 km(2) ), wood shrub (37.65 km(2) ), agricultural land (1,099.71 km(2) ), built-up area (17.76 km(2) ), barren land (3.65 km(2) ), and water body (14.69 km(2) ). Agricultural land increased by 1,258.99 km(2) (36.48%), while wood shrub declined by 161.88 km(2) (4.69%). Rubber plantation, built-up area, barren land, and water bodies were increased by 10.55 km(2) (0.31%), 33.64 km(2) (0.97%), 4.87 km(2) (0.14%) and 15.89 km(2) (0.46%), respectively. The decrease of forest and wood shrub had resulted due to population growth (1.8% from 2008 to 2019) and land conversion for agricultural purposes. Hence, this study may provide vital information for wise sustainable watershed's land management, especially for further study on the effect of land use change on runoff in this area.

TI  - Comparison of influenza surveillance data from the Republic of Korea, selected northern hemisphere countries and Hong Kong SAR (China) from 2012 to 2017
T2  - WESTERN PACIFIC SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza surveillance is conducted in many countries; it is one of the most important types of infectious disease surveillance due to the significant impact and burden of the influenza virus. The Republic of Korea has a temperate climate, and influenza activity usually peaks in the winter as in other temperate-climate countries in the northern hemisphere. This descriptive study compared the influenza surveillance data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with that from other countries and areas in the northern hemisphere, namely China, including Hong Kong SAR, Japan and the United States of America, to identify seasonal influenza patterns from 2012 to 2017. Data on influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) and laboratory surveillance were collected from various sources; visual comparisons were conducted on the onset, duration and the peak timing of each influenza season based on subtypes. Correlation coefficients were estimated, and time differences for the beginning of influenza seasons between the Republic of Korea and other countries were measured. ILIs in North China and cases reported from Japan's sentinel surveillance showed high correlations with the Republic of Korea. The number of confirmed influenza cases in Japan showed a high correlation with the laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in the Republic of Korea. We found that there are similarities in the influenza patterns of the Republic of Korea, Japan and North China. Monitoring these neighbouring countries' data may be useful for understanding influenza patterns in the Republic of Korea. Continuous monitoring and comparison of influenza surveillance data with neighbouring countries is recommended to enhance preparedness against influenza.

TI  - Impact of <i>vanA</i>-Positive <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> Exhibiting Diverse Susceptibility Phenotypes to Glycopeptides on 30-Day Mortality of Patients with a Bloodstream Infection
T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was performed to evaluate the impacts of vanA positivity of Enterococcus faecium exhibiting diverse susceptibility phenotypes to glycopeptides on clinical outcomes in patients with a bloodstream infection (BSI) through a pro-spective, multicenter, observational study. A total of 509 patients with E. faecium BSI from eight sentinel hospitals in South Korea during a 2-year period were enrolled in this study. Risk factors of the hosts and causative E. faecium isolates were assessed to determine associations with the 30-day mortality of E. faecium BSI patients via multivariable logistic regression analyses. The vanA gene was detected in 35.2% (179/509) of E. faecium isolates; 131 E. faecium isolates exhibited typical VanA phe-notypes (group vanA-VanA), while the remaining 48 E. faecium isolates exhibited atypical phenotypes (group vanA-atypical), which included VanD (n = 43) and vancomycin-variable phenotypes (n = 5). A multivariable logistic regression indicated that vanA positivity of causative pathogens was independently associated with the increased 30-day mortality rate in the patients with E. faecium BSI; however, there was no significant difference in survival rates between the patients of the vanA-VanA and vanA-atypical groups (log rank test, P = 0.904). A high 30-day mortality rate was observed in patients with vanA-positive E. faecium BSIs, and vanA positivity of caus-ative E. faecium isolates was an independent risk factor for early mortality irrespec-tive of the susceptibility phenotypes to glycopeptides; thus, intensified antimicrobial stewardship is needed to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with vanA-positive E. faecium BSI.

TI  - Anxiety, fear, and ontological security in world politics: thinking with and beyond Giddens
T2  - INTERNATIONAL THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on ontological security in world politics has mushroomed since the early 2000s but seems to have reached an impasse. Ontological security is a conceptual lens for understanding subjectivity that focuses on the management of anxiety in self-constitution. Building especially on Giddens, IR scholars have emphasized how this translates to a need for cognitive consistency and biographical continuity - a security of 'being.' A criticism has been its so-called 'status quo bias,' a perceived tilt toward theorizing investment in the existing social order. To some, an ontological security lens both offers social theoretic foundations for a realist worldview and lacks resources to conceptualize alternatives. We disagree. Through this symposium, we address that critique and suggest pathways forward by focusing on the thematic of anxiety. Distinguishing between anxiety and fear, we note that anxiety manifests in different emotions and leaves room for a range of political possibilities. Early ontological security scholarship relied heavily on readings of Giddens, which potentially accounts for its bias. This symposium re-opens the question of the relationship between anxiety and subjectivity from the perspective of ontological security, thinking with and beyond Giddens. Three contributions re-think anxiety in ontological security drawing on existentialist philosophy; two address limitations of Giddens' approach.

TI  - Human Dignity and Human Rights: Fostering and Protecting Pluralism and Particularity
T2  - INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL FOR RELIGION AND TRANSFORMATION IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human rights and their universality can lead to restrictions for individuals resulting from duties, which correspond to human rights of all human beings. This characteristic of human rights emphasizes the need for an ethical justification. Addressing the question of how human rights can be justified represents, therefore, an expression of respect for pluralism and particularity. Beyond that, human dignity and human rights lay the foundation for pluralism and particularity as they see all human beings as individuals that are all different and unique, and not as members of a collective. Only human rights protection of the autonomy of each individual allows all human beings to be particular and fosters pluralism. Finally, the concept of "adaptation" contributes to an understanding of the interaction between pluralism and particularity and human dignity and human rights as their foundation by capturing the relationship between human dignity and human rights and religious and worldview-based communities.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the beginning of the XX century, political, economic, and demographic revolutions contributed to the emergence of extraordinary people. In architecture, they were Frank Lloyd Wright, Antonio Gaudi, Frank Owen Gary, Le Corbusier, Hugo Hering, Alvar Aalto, Hans Sharun, Walter Burley Griffin, and Marion Mahony Griffin. Each of them was given a lot of attention in the media resources and their creativity was researched in different fields of knowledge. However, Rudolf Steiner's work remains controversial to this day. Although many of the architects mentioned above enthusiastically commented on Steiner's architectural works, there was always ambiguity in the perception of this mystic architect. Such a careful attitude to the work of the architect is due primarily to his worldview, his extraordinary approach to art and architecture in particular, because it is in architecture that Steiner was able to implement the basic tenets of anthroposophy, which he founded. The purpose of this study is to determine the content of the spatial structure of Steiner's architecture, which makes it unique in the history of architectural heritage. The authors offer the scientific community the first article in a series of articles on the anthroposophical architecture of Rudolf Steiner and the philosophical concept that influenced the formation of this architecture.

TI  - Gas Emission Craters and Mound-Predecessors in the North of West Siberia, Similarities and Differences
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed analysis of five gas emission craters (GEC) found in the north of West Siberia is presented. Remote sensing data used in the study is verified by field surveys. Previous studies show that all of the GECs were preceded by mounds 2 to 6 m high and 20 to 55 m in diameter. GECs initially were 20-25 m in diameter, which increased in the first years of their existence. GECs are found in various environmental (shrublands or moss-grass tundra) and geomorphic (river valley, terrace, slopes) conditions. The objective of the paper is to identify common and differing geomorphologic and environmental characteristics of all the five GEC, and their mound-predecessors. The study is based on a compilation of DSMs before and after the GEC formation using very high-resolution satellite imagery stereo pairs compared to ArcticDEM project data. Diversity of terrain and environmental settings along with rather a narrow range of GEC and mound-predecessor morphometric parameters allows concluding that the mechanism of GEC formation is most likely similar for all the GEC and is controlled rather by internal geologic and cryolithologic structure than by any surface properties.

TI  - Dynamics of Biotic Carbon Fluxes under Different Scenarios of Forest Area Changes
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper estimates the global biotic carbon fluxes into the atmosphere under various scenarios of changes in forest area for temperate/boreal and tropical zones. Forestry scenarios have been developed from both national forest land-cover inventories and various estimates for tree vegetation-cover areas derived from the Earth's remote sensing data for recent decades. Three scenarios have been proposed for changes in the area of temperate/boreal forests: FAOSTAT (a growth scenario on the basis of inventories), CONST (a scenario of maintaining the present level), and LANDSAT (a scenario on the basis of satellite data from different sources). The trend of tropical deforestation is maintained for FAOSTAT and LANDSAT scenarios. Together with GEPL97 (the base scenario published earlier by the authors), these scenarios have been used to obtain model biotic carbon fluxes. A model of the global carbon cycle developed in MPEI and recently updated to take into account anthropogenic carbon emissions (both industrial and related to deforestation/land use) has been used to perform a thorough analysis of the plausible dynamics of biotic carbon sources and sinks. It has been shown that the magnitude and sign of biotic carbon fluxes into the atmosphere depends substantially on the adopted scenario-from preserving the biosphere as an effective sink of excess carbon from the atmosphere in the current century (GEPL97 and CONST) to its turning into an additional source of CO2(LANDSAT). The FAOSTAT scenario leads to the return of biotic carbon fluxes by 2100 to the modern level. The maximum difference in net carbon fluxes from the biosphere to atmosphere for the scenarios considered here is almost 2.5 Gt C/year and falls approximately on the middle of the current century. The difference between the corresponding CO(2)concentrations for these scenarios reaches 65 ppm by 2100.

TI  - West Nile Virus in Slovenia
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes. Birds are the reservoir for the virus; humans, horses and other mammals are dead-end hosts. Infections caused by WNV in humans can vary from asymptomatic infections to West Nile fever (WNF) or West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND). In 1995, a serosurvey was performed in Slovenia on forest workers, and WNV specific IgG antibodies were confirmed in 6.8% of the screened samples, indicating that WNV is circulating in Slovenia. No human disease cases were detected in Slovenia until 2013, when the first case of WNV infection was confirmed in a retrospective study in a 79-year old man with meningitis. In 2018, three patients with WNND were confirmed by laboratory tests, with detection of IgM antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid of the patients. In one of the patients, WNV RNA was detected in the urine sample. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, a mosquito study was performed in Slovenia. Mosquitoes were sampled on 14 control locations and 35 additional locations in 2019. No WNV was detected in mosquitoes in 2017 and 2019, but we confirmed the virus in a pool ofCulexsp. mosquitoes in 2018. The virus was successfully isolated, and complete genome sequence was acquired. The whole genome of the WNV was also sequenced from the patient's urine sample. The whole genome sequences of the WNV virus detected in Slovenian patient and mosquito indicate the virus most likely spread from the north, because of the geographic proximity and because the sequences cluster with the Austrian and Hungarian sequences. A sentinel study was performed on dog sera samples, and we were able to confirm IgG antibodies in 1.8% and 4.3% of the samples in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Though Slovenia is not a highly endemic country for WNV, we have established that the virus circulates in Slovenia.

TI  - Change Detection Based on the Coefficient of Variation in SAR Time-Series of Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses change detection in SAR time-series. First, several statistical properties of the coefficient of variation highlight its pertinence for change detection. Subsequently, several criteria are proposed. The coefficient of variation is suggested to detect any kind of change. Furthermore, several criteria that are based on ratios of coefficients of variations are proposed to detect long events, such as construction test sites, or point-event, such as vehicles. These detection methods are first evaluated on theoretical statistical simulations to determine the scenarios where they can deliver the best results. The simulations demonstrate the greater sensitivity of the coefficient of variation to speckle mixtures, as in the case of agricultural plots. Conversely, they also demonstrate the greater specificity of the other criteria for the cases addressed: very short event or longer-term changes. Subsequently, detection performance is assessed on real data for different types of scenes and sensors (Sentinel-1, UAVSAR). In particular, a quantitative evaluation is performed with a comparison of our solutions with baseline methods. The proposed criteria achieve the best performance, with reduced computational complexity. On Sentinel-1 images containing mainly construction test sites, our best criterion reaches a probability of change detection of 90% for a false alarm rate that is equal to 5%. On UAVSAR images containing boats, the criteria proposed for short events achieve a probability of detection equal to 90% of all pixels belonging to the boats, for a false alarm rate that is equal to 2%.

TI  - The added value of sentinel node mapping in endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To evaluate long-term oncological outcomes and the added value of sentinel lymph node sampling (SLN) compared to pelvic lymph node dissection (LND) in patients with endometrial cancer (EC).Methods. During the evaluation phase of SLN for EC, we performed LND and SLN and retrospectively compared the oncologic outcome with the immediate non-overlapping historical era during which patients underwent LND.Results. From 2007 to 2010, 193 patients underwent LND and from December 2010 to 2014, 250 patients had SLN mapping with completion LND. Both groups had similar clinical characteristics. During a median follow-up period of 6.9 years, addition of SLN was associated with more favorable oncological outcomes compared to LND with 6-year overall survival (OS) of 90% compared to 81% (p = 0.009), and progression free survival (PFS) of 85% compared to 75% (p = 0.01) respectively. SLN was associated with improved OS (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8, p = 0.004), and PFS (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9, p = 0.03) in a multivariable analysis, adjusted for age, ASA score, stage, grade, non-endometrioid histology, and LVSI. Patients who were staged with SLN were less likely to have a recurrence in the pelvis or lymph node basins compared to patients who underwent LND only (6-year recurrence-free survival 95% vs 90%, p = 0.04).Conclusion. Addition of SLN to LND was ultimately associated with improved clinical outcomes compared to LND alone in patients with endometrial cancer undergoing surgical staging, suggesting that the data provided by the analysis of the SLN added relevant clinical information, and improved the decision on adjuvant therapy.

TI  - Using Artificial Neural Networks and Remotely Sensed Data to Evaluate the Relative Importance of Variables for Prediction of Within-Field Corn and Soybean Yields
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield prediction prior to harvest is important for crop income and insurance projections, and for evaluating food security. Yet, modeling crop yield is challenging because of the complexity of the relationships between crop growth and predictor variables, especially at the field scale. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) method was used: (1) to evaluate the relative importance of predictor variables for the prediction of within-field corn and soybean end-of-season yield and (2) to evaluate the performance of the ANN models with a minimal optimized variable dataset for their capacity to predict corn and soybean yield over multiple years at the within-field level. Several satellite derived vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index-NDVI, red edge NDVI and simple ratio-SR) and elevation derived variables (slope, flow accumulation, aspect) were used as crop yield predictor variables, hypothesizing that the different variables reflect different crop and site conditions. The study identified the SR index and the slope as the most important predictor variables for both crop types during two training and testing years (2011, 2012). The dates of the most important SR images, however, were different for the two crop types and corresponded to their critical crop developmental stages (phenology). The relative mean absolute errors were overall smaller for corn compared to soybean: all of the 2011 corn study fields had errors below 10%; 75% of the fields had errors below 10% in 2012. The errors were more variable for soybean. In 2011, 37% of the fields had errors below 10%, while in 2012, 100% of the fields had errors below 20%. The results are promising and can provide yield estimates at the farm level, which could be useful in refining broader scale (e.g., county, region) yield projections.

TI  - Penile Melanoma In Situ: Long Term Follow Up
T2  - UROLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Penile melanoma in situ is extremely rare. Various treatments have been reported with good success, however follow up is generally limited to 1 year or less. The optimal treatment regimen, pattern of disease progression and utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy are not established. We provide the longest reported follow up for penile malignant melanoma in-situ, highlighting a long-term pattern of recurrence and a route of progression which does not follow more reliable patterns of lymphatic spread known to penile squamous cell carcinoma. A cautious approach should be taken for organ-sparing approaches along with proper patient counseling and close, long-term follow-up. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Pixel level fusion techniques for SAR and optical images: A review
T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Review
AB  - Image Fusion is a process of combining two or more images into a single image which is more informative and hence more useful from an interpretation point of view. With the rapid development of different remote sensing satellites capturing information from the earth by sensing energy in different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, complementary information about the area captured by different satellites is available. A fusion of these images is much more helpful in different remote sensing applications than that of single sensor image data. This paper discusses the necessity of fusing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical imagery. A survey is presented for various pixel level approaches used for the fusion of SAR and optical images. Quality metrics used to evaluate the performance of a fusion algorithm, are briefly introduced and visual as well as quantitative evaluation of basic component substitution and wavelet-based fusion approaches is presented for the fusion of RISAT-1 SAR and Resourcesat-2 multispectral data. Finally, the review concludes that there is scope for further research of fusion of SAR and optical images due to various microwave and optical sensors with the improved resolution being launched regularly.

TI  - Scale effects in remotely sensed greenspace metrics and how to mitigate them for environmental health exposure assessment
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Metrics representing exposure to the natural environment are widely used in environmental health-related studies. They are calculated using a variety of different data sources representing greenspace and a range of buffer sizes representing human interaction with the environment. Previous studies have identified issues relating to buffer distance and scaling effects on greenspace exposure assessments when using satellite image-derived metrics. We evaluate the spatial scale sensitivity of three common greenspace metrics (i.e., Normalised Difference Vegetation Index- NDVI, Leaf Area Index- LAI, and Land Use and Land Cover-LULC), using lacunarity analysis, as a scale-dependent measure of heterogeneity based on the principles of fractals. By producing a lacunarity curve' across multiple spatial scales, we defined the scale-variances for specific greenspace metrics, including the upper scale limit at which the metrics become invariant, approximately 640 m for Sentinel-2 and 480 m for Landsat-8. Each of the greenspace metrics we considered exhibited scale sensitivities, meaning that each is expected to have a different influence on the strength and significance of the statistical associations found between greenspace exposure and health depending on the spatial scale of analysis (e.g., buffer distance). Using lacunarity curves, we produced a novel composite, multi-scale greenspace 'exposure index' in which each input scale is weighted according to its relative scale sensitivity. We also created a multi-scale, multi-metric map combining the different vegetation measures while accounting for scale. We found that cumulative exposure gradients across a large urban conurbation are even more marked when using our multi-scale 'exposure index' maps compared to traditional approaches. Our multi-scale, composite greenspace 'exposure index' mapping techniques are not as vulnerable to scale effects as traditional approaches and can be readily transferred to the analysis of other environmental exposure variables such as air pollution.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Technique in Apparent Early Ovarian Cancer: Laparoscopic Technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Study Objective: To demonstrate the feasibility of laparoscopic sentinel lymph node technique in presumed early-stage ovarian cancer.Design: Video illustrating the laparoscopic performance of the sentinel lymph node technique in ovarian cancer.Setting: The Oncologic Gynecology Department at the University Hospital La Fe.Patients: Candidates for the technique presented an apparent early stage ovarian cancer. The technique was performed in the context of a clinical trial called SENTOV (NCT03452982).Interventions: To date, lymphadenectomy is recommended after the diagnosis of apparent early -stage ovarian cancer as part of the surgical staging. Minimally invasive surgery can be considered for the purpose of restaging [1]. Up to 14% of the patients are upstaged because of positive lymph nodes after pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy [2]. Regarding low-grade tumors, a lower rate of lymph node involvement has been reported [3]. Sentinel lymph node technique has been reported to be feasible in a recent pilot study [4]. Two clinical trials (Sentinel Lymph Node in Early Ovarian Cancer and Sentine Lymph Node in Early Ovarian Cancer) are currently ongoing to clarify the use of sentinel lymph node technique in early ovarian cancer.The injection points were at the infundibulopelvic and ovarian ligament stumps. Two hundred microliters of saline solution containing 37 MBq of technetium -99m nanocolloid followed by 0.5 mL of indocyanine green (ICG) was injected subperito- neally. We used a 27 G needle at each injection point.Immediately after injection and also at 15 and 30 minutes after injection, the operative field was checked guided by the acoustic signal of the gamma probe and the near-infrared camera. We performed a minimum dissection looking for the sentinel lymph node or nodes in the pelvic and para-aortic region. Any lymph node with a remarkable radioactivity count as high as 10 times the background and/or dyed with ICG was considered a sentinel lymph node and was har- vested separately. A systematic surgical staging was performed after the sentinel lymph node procedure was completed.Because of its small size, the ICG molecule is not caught in the lymph node valve system and keeps migrating when per- forming lymphography. An exhaustive direct view of the dye path is required to avoid misleading detection of the real sentinel lymph node. This theoretical problem is resolved by the use of the 99mTC-nanocolloid. This tracer gets trapped into the lymph node valve system because of its molecular size and does not keep migrating as does ICG. As such, a combination of both methods is proposed.Conclusion: Laparoscopic performance of sentinel lymph node technique in ovarian cancer seems to achievable. Between 2017 and 2019, this procedure was performed in 30 patients (13 laparoscopic), in the context of our pilot experience [4] and the Sentinel Lymph Node in Early Ovarian Cancer clinical trial (NCT03452982).

TI  - Parasitism of Locally Recruited Egg Parasitoids of the Fall Armyworm in Africa
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The fall armyworm (FAW),Spodoptera frugiperda(J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is an insect native to the tropical and subtropical Americas that has recently spread to Africa, where it predominately attacks maize, sorghum and other plant species. Biological control is an environmentally friendly way of combatting the pest and contributes to an integrated pest management approach. In Africa, several trichogrammatid parasitoids andTelenomus remusNixon (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) have been found parasitizing eggs of the FAW. In Niger, the egg parasitoids encountered includeTrichogrammatoideasp. (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) andTelenomus remusNixon. Parasitism of the FAW eggs by the two egg parasitoids was assessed in the laboratory, followed by field testing on sentinel eggs. In the laboratory,T. remusparasitized on average 78% of FAW eggs, compared to 25% forTrichogrammatoideasp.Telenomus remuswas able to parasitize egg masses that were fully covered with scales, whileTrichogrammatoideasp. parasitized only uncovered egg masses. On-farm releases ofT. remusin sorghum fields caused up to 64% of FAW egg parasitism. Parasitized eggs yielded viable progeny, which can contribute to FAW egg parasitism build-up during the cropping season. Our findings lay the groundwork for the use ofT. remusin augmentative releases against FAW in Africa.

TI  - Classification of Atlantic Coastal Sand Dune Vegetation Using In Situ, UAV, and Airborne Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping coastal dune vegetation is critical to understand dune mobility and resilience in the context of climate change, sea level rise, and increased anthropogenic pressure. However, the identification of plant species from remotely sensed data is tedious and limited to broad vegetation communities, while such environments are dominated by fragmented and small-scale landscape patterns. In June 2019, a comprehensive multi-scale survey including unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), hyperspectral ground, and airborne data was conducted along approximately 20 km of a coastal dune system in southwest France. The objective was to generate an accurate mapping of the main sediment and plant species ground cover types in order to characterize the spatial distribution of coastal dune stability patterns. Field and UAV data were used to assess the quality of airborne data and generate a robust end-member spectral library. Next, a two-step classification approach, based on the normalized difference vegetation index and Random Forest classifier, was developed. Results show high performances with an overall accuracy of 100% and 92.5% for sand and vegetation ground cover types, respectively. Finally, a coastal dune stability index was computed across the entire study site. Different stability patterns were clearly identified along the coast, highlighting for the first time the high potential of this methodology to support coastal dune management.

TI  - Wetland Mapping with Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-1, ALOS-1 PALSAR, and LiDAR Data in Southern New Brunswick, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping wetlands with high spatial and thematic accuracy is crucial for the management and monitoring of these important ecosystems. Wetland maps in New Brunswick (NB) have traditionally been produced by the visual interpretation of aerial photographs. In this study, we used an alternative method to produce a wetland map for southern New Brunswick, Canada, by classifying a combination of Landsat 8 OLI, ALOS-1 PALSAR, Sentinel-1, and LiDAR-derived topographic metrics with the Random Forests (RF) classifier. The images were acquired in three seasons (spring, summer, and fall) with different water levels and during leaf-off/on periods. The resulting map has eleven wetland classes (open bog, shrub bog, treed bog, open fen, shrub fen, freshwater marsh, coastal marsh, shrub marsh, shrub wetland, forested wetland, and aquatic bed) plus various non-wetland classes. We achieved an overall accuracy classification of 97.67%. We compared 951 in-situ validation sites to the classified image and both the 2106 and 2019 reference maps available through Service New Brunswick. Both reference maps were produced by photo-interpretation of RGB-NIR digital aerial photographs, but the 2019 NB reference also included information from LiDAR-derived surface and ecological metrics. Of these 951 sites, 94.95% were correctly identified on the classified image, while only 63.30% and 80.02% of these sites were correctly identified on the 2016 and 2019 NB reference maps, respectively. If only the 489 wetland validation sites were considered, 96.93% of the sites were correctly identified as a wetland on the classified image, while only 58.69% and 62.17% of the sites were correctly identified as a wetland on the 2016 and 2019 NB reference maps, respectively.

TI  - Fault Geometry and Slip Distribution of the 2013 Mw 7.7 Balochistan Earthquake From Inversions of SAR and Optical Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2013 Mw 7.7 Balochistan earthquake ruptured the Hoshab fault (Pakistan) over 200 km. It was dominated by left-lateral slip, with a secondary reverse component. By combining optical (SPOT 5 and Landsat 8) and radar satellite data (RADARSAT-2 and TerraSAR-X ScanSAR), we derive the 3-D coseismic displacement field and the slip distribution. Our modeling strategy involves two successive inversions allowing to explore first the fault geometry and then slip distribution. Following a statistical analysis of the coseismic surface trace, the fault is discretized into 16 segments. To determine the dip angle and down-dip width of the segments, we then perform a non-linear elastic inversion of the geodetic data set. Using output of this model, we prescribe the fault geometry and linearly invert for slip at depth with refined discretization. Results show a decrease of the fault dip, reaching 50 degrees in the central part of the fault that structurally connects the two sub-vertical terminations dipping at >70 degrees. The distribution of strike-slip forms a shallow continuous patch (0-8 km) that peaks at 12.7 m of slip near the epicenter. Reverse slip is distributed on several patches and becomes shallower near the southern termination, where it peaks at 5.7 m. Our model shows an absence of shallow slip deficit (SSD), as for other Mw 7.5 + strike-slip earthquakes elsewhere, hence suggesting that SSD is only found for lesser magnitude earthquakes. We speculate that moment magnitude is a key element in the occurrence of SSD.

TI  - Internally Heated Porous Convection: An Idealized Model for Enceladus' Hydrothermal Activity
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent planetary data and geophysical modeling suggest that hydrothermal activity is ongoing under the ice crust of Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons. According to these models, hydrothermal flow in the porous, rocky core of the satellite is driven by tidal deformation that induces dissipation and volumetric internal heating. Despite the effort in the modeling of Enceladus' interior, systematic understanding-and even basic scaling laws-of internally heated porous convection and hydrothermal activity are still lacking. In this article, using an idealized model of an internally heated porous medium, we explore numerically and theoretically the flows that develop close to and far from the onset of convection. In particular, we quantify heat-transport efficiency by convective flows as well as the typical extent and intensity of heat flux anomalies created at the top of the porous layer. With our idealized model, we derive simple and general laws governing the temperature and hydrothermal velocity that can be driven in the oceans of icy moons. In the future, these laws could help better constraining models of the interior of Enceladus and other icy satellites.Plain Language Summary Enceladus, one of Saturn's icy moons, is known from planetary data to be the site of ongoing hydrothermal activity. According to recent modeling, this activity is driven by tidal distortion throughout its porous rocky core, which causes friction and induces volumetric heating. As subsurface liquid water penetrates through the core, it warms, rises, and returns into the ocean through localized hot spots. We introduce an idealized model of this hydrothermal circulation in order to understand the formation of hot spots, their typical size, and their activity. We find that the hydrothermal flow in the porous core of Enceladus is about a few centimeters per year and is thus much slower than circulations in the Earth's ocean crust. As a result, the timescale for hot-spot activity-variations is as long as a few million years. Despite the slowness of the circulation, we predict that it drives oceanic plumes with velocity of the order of 1cm.s(-1).

TI  - Management of Noncutaneous Melanomas
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Noncutaneous melanomas are rare subtypes of melanoma with high rates of metastatic disease and poor overall survival. One-third to one-half of cases are amelanotic, which may contribute to a delay in diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry staining with typical melanoma markers helps confirm the diagnosis. There is no standard staging system across mucosal melanomas. Elective nodal dissection is not recommended and there is a paucity of data to support use of sentinel lymph node biopsy. Mutational analysis should be routinely performed. Systemic therapy options include targeted inhibitors, immunotherapy, and cytotoxic chemotherapy, although further studies are needed to confirm their efficacy.

TI  - The specific W-boxes of <i>GAPC5</i> promoter bound by <i>Ta</i>WRKY are involved in drought stress response in wheat
T2  - PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the most common abiotic stresses, and can limit wheat yield, crops and productivity. GAPCs play vital roles under drought stress conditions in multiple species. The aim of this experiment was to determine the regulatory mechanism of TaGAPC5 under drought stress. In this study, the genes and promoters of TaGAPC5 in diverse drought-tolerant cultivars were cloned. The amino acid sequences were conserved, while the promoter fragments were not identical. Under abiotic stress, the expression level of TaGAPC5 was substantially different among the diverse drought-tolerant cultivars and the promoter activities were significantly improved. The yeast one-hybrid system and Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that TaWRKYs bound to specific W-boxes: TaWRKY28, TaWRKY33, TaWRKY40 and TaWRKY47 bind to G/ATGACG/C/A, C/G/ATGACG, C/ATGACC and C/ATGACC/G, respectively. By analyzing different 5' deletion mutants of these promoters, it was determined that these W-boxes in CW-TaGAPC5 promoter (-1262, -1202, -904, -880 and -207) and ZY-TaGAPC5 promoter (-697 and -220) bound by these four TaWRKYs and were functional under drought stress. The deletion or addition of specific W-boxes in the promoter fragments significantly restrained or advanced the promoter activity under drought stress, and these results further confirmed that these W-boxes play vital roles in improving transcription levels under drought stress. The W-boxes in CW-TaGAPC5P (-1262, -1202, -904, -880 and -207) and ZY-TaGAPC5P (-697 and -220) were identified as the key cis-elements for responding to drought stress and were bound by the transcription factor TaWRKY.

TI  - Simulation of Evapotranspiration at a 3-Minute Time Interval Based on Remote Sensing Data and SEBAL Model
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application Our research not only provides a method for estimating evapotranspiration, but also provides the possibility for additional remote sensing models to appear on a "minute" or even "second" time scale. Using remote sensing to estimate evapotranspiration minute frequency is the basis for accurately calculating hourly and daily evapotranspiration from the regional scale. However, from the existing research, it is difficult to use remote sensing data to estimate evapotranspiration minute frequency. This paper uses GF-4 and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in conjunction with the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model to estimate ET at a 3-min time interval in part of China and South Korea, and compares those simulation results with that from field measured data. According to the spatial distribution of ET derived from GF-4 and MODIS, the texture of ET derived from GF-4 is more obvious than that of MODIS, and GF-4 is able to express the variability of the spatial distribution of ET. Meanwhile, according to the value of ET derived from both GF-4 and MODIS, results from these two satellites have significant linear correlation, and ET derived from GF-4 is higher than that from MODIS. Since the temporal resolution of GF-4 is 3 min, the land surface ET at a 3-min time interval could be obtained by utilizing all available meteorological and remote sensing data, which avoids error associated with extrapolating instantaneously from a single image.

TI  - Stage III uterine serous carcinoma: modern trends in multimodality treatment
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To examine outcomes in a modern treatment era for stage III uterine serous carcinoma (USC).Methods: Fifty women were retrospectively identified as 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III USC patients who received radiotherapy (RT) at our institution between 1/2003-5/2018. The patients were divided into 2 cohorts: 20 in the early era (2003-2010) and 30 in the modern era (2011-2018). Patient characteristics were compared using.2 tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier estimates, the log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards.Results: The modern era differed from the early era in the increased use of volume-directed external beam RT (EBRT) as opposed to vaginal brachytherapy (VB) alone (33.3% vs 5.0%, p=0.048), minimally invasive surgery (56.7% vs. 25%, p=0.027), sentinel node sampling (26.7% vs. 0%, p=0.012), computed tomography imaging in the perioperative period (63.3% vs. 30%, p=0.044), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu testing (96.7% vs. 55%, p=0.001). Median follow-up for early and modern eras was 37.27 and 33.23 months, respectively. The early vs. modern 3-year RFS was 33% and 64% (p=0.039), respectively, while the 3-year OS was 55% and 90% (p=0.034). Regional nodal recurrence more common among the patients who received VB only (p=0.048).Conclusion: Modern era treatment was associated with improved RFS and OS in patients with stage III USC. Regional nodal recurrences were significantly reduced in patients who received EBRT.

TI  - Spatial Attraction Models Coupled with Elman Neural Networks for Enhancing Sub-Pixel Urban Inundation Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban flooding is one of the most costly and destructive natural hazards worldwide. Remote-sensing images with high temporal resolutions have been extensively applied to timely inundation monitoring, assessing and mapping, but are limited by their low spatial resolution. Sub-pixel mapping has drawn great attention among researchers worldwide and has demonstrated a promising potential of high-accuracy mapping of inundation. Aimed to boost sub-pixel urban inundation mapping (SUIM) from remote-sensing imagery, a new algorithm based on spatial attraction models and Elman neural networks (SAMENN) was developed and examined in this paper. The Elman neural networks (ENN)-based SUIM module was developed firstly. Then a normalized edge intensity index of mixed pixels was generated. Finally the algorithm of SAMENN-SUIM was constructed and implemented. Landsat 8 images of two cities of China, which experienced heavy floods, were used in the experiments. Compared to three traditional SUIM methods, SAMENN-SUIM attained higher mapping accuracy according not only to visual evaluations but also quantitative assessments. The effects of normalized edge intensity index threshold and neuron number of the hidden layer on accuracy of the SAMENN-SUIM algorithm were analyzed and discussed. The newly developed algorithm in this study made a positive contribution to advancing urban inundation mapping from remote-sensing images with medium-low spatial resolutions, and hence can favor urban flood monitoring and risk assessment.

TI  - A high-resolution bathymetry dataset for global reservoirs using multi-source satellite imagery and altimetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although accurate 3-D reservoir bathymetry is a key input for multiple applications (such as global hydrological models, local water resources related studies, and others), such information is only available for very few locations. To fill this knowledge gap, we generated a 30 m resolution bathymetry dataset for 347 global reservoirs, representing a total volume of 3123 km(3) (50% of the global reservoir capacity). First, Area-Elevation (A-E) relationships for the identified reservoirs were derived by combining altimetry data from multiple satellites with Landsat imagery data. Next, the resulting A-E relationships were applied to the Surface Water Occurrence (SWO) data from the JRC Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset to obtain bathymetry values for the dynamic areas of the reservoirs. Lastly, an extrapolation method was adopted to help achieve the full bathymetry dataset. The remotely sensed bathymetry results were primarily validated against the following: (1) They were validated against Area-Elevation (A-E) and Elevation-Volume (E-V) relationships derived from the in situ elevations and volumes for 16 reservoirs, with root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of elevation from 0.06 m to 1.99 m, and normalized RMSE values of storage from 0.56% to 4.40%. (2) They were also validated against survey bathymetric maps for four reservoirs, with R-2 values from 0.82 to 0.99 and RMSE values from 0.13 m to 2.31 m. The projected portions have relatively large errors and uncertainties (compared to the remotely sensed portions) because the extrapolated elevations cannot fully capture the underwater topography. Overall, this approach performs better for reservoirs with a large dynamic area fractions. It can also be applied to small reservoirs (e.g., reservoirs with surface areas of a few square kilometers or less), where ICESat observations are available, and to large natural lakes. With the contribution of ICESat-2, this dataset has the potential to be expanded to thousands of reservoirs and lakes in the future.

TI  - Comparison of the MODIS and VIIRS Thermal Emissive Band Radiometric Calibration
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) are major instruments for Earth science observations. Nearly 40 MODIS scientific products and a wide range of VIIRS environmental data records are produced using their global observations. The consistency of the MODIS and VIIRS calibrated data is important for the study of Earth science. This article assesses the calibration consistency of the Aqua MODIS and VIIRS thermal emissive band (TEB) data. To remove the impact of the mismatched relative spectral response (RSR) on the comparisons, the simultaneous nadir observation data from the cross-track infrared sounder (CrIS) and the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer (IASI) are used as references in two different methods to independently verify the consistency. The comparisons of the MODIS and VIIRS TEB calibrated data show that the brightness temperature (BT) differences for comparable bands between MODIS and VIIRS are in general within 0.2 K for BT larger than 230 K. The differences of all comparable MODIS and VIIRS TEBs are consistent over time. MODIS measurements agree better with N20 VIIRS than with Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) VIIRS. The S-NPP VIIRS measurements are higher than N20 VIIRS, within 0.1 K for long-wave infrared (LWIR) bands and 0.3 K for band M13.

TI  - Dynamic modeling and analysis of wind turbine drivetrain considering the effects of non-torque loads
T2  - APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increase of the rotor diameter and the deterioration of operating conditions, modern wind turbines suffer from more and more significant time-varying non-torque loads, which increases the burden of turbine structures especially the gearbox. Based on an aeroelastic loose coupling approach and assembly of the finite element method, an integrated drivetrain coupling analysis model including blade module, aerodynamic module, and gearbox module is established in this study. This proposed model is validated by comparing the calculation results with previous literature. Taking National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5-MW wind turbine as the research object, the gearbox vibration responses, gear meshing forces and bearing forces under non-torque loads caused by blade gravity, wind shear (WS), tower shadow (TS) and yawed inflow are studied in detail. Results show that the y-direction displacements of the gearbox, sun gear 1, sun gear 2 and gear are larger than those in x-direction because Fy or M x generated by blade gravity, WS and TS dominates the non-torque loads. The non-torque loads lead to a non-uniform planet load sharing especially for the planetary gear stage 1. Because of the fluctuations of non-torque loads, not only the rotation frequencies of the corresponding carrier but also the multiple frequencies of the carrier 1 are observed in the frequency spectrums. The non-torque loads are mainly borne by carrier 1 bearings. Except for the blade gravity, the bearing forces caused by other unsteady inflows have obvious fluctuations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Landsat-Based Estimation of the Glacier Surface Temperature of Hailuogou Glacier, Southeastern Tibetan Plateau, Between 1990 and 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surface temperature (GST) is influenced by both the energy flux from the atmosphere above and the thermal dynamics at the ice-water-debris interfaces. However, previous studies on GST are inadequate in time series research and mountain glacier surface temperature retrieval. We evaluate the GST variability at Hailuogou glacier, a temperate glacier located in Southeastern Tibetan Plateau, from 1990 to 2018. We utilized a modified mono-window algorithm to calculate the GST using the Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) band 10 data and Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM) band 6 data. Three essential parameters, including the emissivity of ice and snow, atmospheric transmittance, and effective mean atmospheric temperature, were employed in the GST algorithm. The remotely-sensed temperatures were compared with two other single-channel algorithms to validate GST algorithm's accuracy. Results from different algorithms showed a good agreement, with a mean difference of about 0.6 celcius. Our results showed that the GST of the Hailuogou glacier, both in the upper debris-free part and the lower debris-covered tongue, has experienced a slightly increasing trend at a rate of 0.054 celcius a(-1)during the past decades. Atmospheric warming, expanding debris cover in the lower part, and a darkening debris-free accumulation area are the main causes of the warming of the glacier surface.

TI  - The refined spatiotemporal representation of soil organic matter based on remote images fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology is important for soil organic matter (SOM) estimation, but existing studies have mainly relied on a single data source. This limitation makes it difficult to simultaneously ensure high spatial resolution, high spectral accuracy and refined temporal granularity simultaneously, which cannot meet the requirements of the spatiotemporal dynamics representation. This study aimed to introduce a new remote sensing image source into SOM modeling and spatiotemporal estimation generated by fusing together Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 remote sensing images that have a 5-day revisit cycle; 10 m spatial resolution; and 21 different bands in blue, green, red and NIR spectral ranges. According to the image fusion process, a total of 52 available images were acquired between November 2016 and December 2018 in Donghai County, China. The fused images were used for SOM estimation model associated with 107 field samples. The results indicated that, first, the optimal model consisted of the band reflectivity (B20) and RVI (B18/B9), which were derived from the fused images, and the R-2 approached 0.7 in the two phases of the synchronized data. Second, the modeling accuracy was influenced to some extent by the actual SOM content. The R-2 values exceeded 0.75 when the SOM content was higher than 24 g/kg, while the R-2 was even lower than 0.35 when the SOM content was lower. Third, the averaged SOM contents remained stable in general, while the seasonal variances can also be found during the two-year interval. The SOM contents maintained a low level during autumn and winter, while higher SOM levels were found in the spring and summer. Finally, the spatial variations could be described as 'low in the west and high in the east'. In summary, the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOM highlighted the necessity of modeling with fused remote sensing images, and more effective modeling could be expected with the continued increase in SOM in future.

TI  - A Case of Recurrent Vulvar Carcinoma With Cardiac Metastasis: Case Report and Review of the Literature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - A 67-yr-old female patient was diagnosed with squamous cell vulvar carcinoma and treated with a radical vulvectomy and bilateral sentinel lymphadenectomy. Three months after the surgery, the patient presented with local recurrence and underwent surgical excision of the mass, followed by chemotherapy. Eight months later, the patient was admitted due to weakness and pleural effusion. The patient underwent a chest computed tomography and echocardiogram, which revealed a large mass in the right ventricle penetrating into the pericardium and an additional mass residing on the tricuspid valve. She underwent a pericardial biopsy, and the pathology revealed a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma metastasis. The patient was admitted thereafter in the oncological department for additional chemotherapy treatment. Because of a rapid deterioration in the patient's condition, only palliative treatment was given, and the patient died shortly after. Secondary cardiac tumors are very rare and have not been extensively studied in oncology. Therefore, optimal management is not entirely clear. It is extremely rare for vulvar cancer to metastasize to the heart, and only a handful of cases have been reported in the literature.

TI  - Soil Moisture Information Content in SMOS, SMAP, AMSR2, and ASCAT Level-1 Data Over Selected <i>In Situ</i> Sites
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave brightness temperature (Tb) and backscatter (sigma(0)) observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument, and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) instrument provide a wealth of operationally available satellite data for soil moisture retrieval and data assimilation purposes. To assist the synergistic and efficient use of such techniques, the soil moisture information content in the respective Level-1 observations needs to be determined. Within this context, we compare L-, C-, and X-band Tb and sigma(0) signatures of the above-named sensors to in situ SM observations in Spain, Australia, and USA. We find that L-band Tb observations from SMOS and SMAP show the best overall performance given the considered diagnostics (correlation, anomaly correlation, and sensitivity), while all sensors provide significant soil moisture information. This finding is consistent across the analyzed incidence angle range for SMOS (25 degrees-60 degrees). The results are discussed with respect to physical processes governing the dynamics of Tb and sigma(0), noting dependencies on vegetation seasonality and land surface temperature.

TI  - An Event-Based Inventory Approach in Landslide Hazard Assessment: The Case of the Skolis Mountain, Northwest Peloponnese, Greece
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of landslide hazard across mountains is imperative for public safety. Pre- and post-earthquake landslide mapping envisage that landslides show significant size changes during earthquake activity. One of the purposes of earthquake-induced landslide investigation is to determine the landslide state and geometry and draw conclusions on their mobility. This study was based on remote sensing data that covered 72 years, and focused on the west slopes of the Skolis Mountains, in the northwest Peloponnese. On 8 June 2008, during the strong Movri Mountain earthquake (Mw = 6.4), we mapped the extremely abundant landslide occurrence. Historical seismicity and remote sensing data indicate that the Skolis Mountain west slope is repeatedly affected by landslides. The impact of the earthquakes was based on the estimation of Arias intensity in the study area. We recognized that 89 landslides developed over the last 72 years. These landslides increased their width (W), called herein as inflation or their length (L), termed as enlargement. Length and width changes were used to describe their aspect ratio (L/W). Based on the aspect ratio, the 89 landslides were classified into three types: I, J, and Delta. Taluses, developed at the base of the slope and belonging to the J- and Delta-landslide types, are supplied by narrow or irregular channels. During the earthquakes, the landslide channels migrated upward and downward, outlining the mobility of the earthquake-induced landslides. Landslide mobility was defined by the reach angle. The reach angle is the arctangent of the landslide's height to length ratio. Furthermore, we analyzed the present slope stability across the Skolis Mountain by using the landslide density (LD), landslide area percentage (LAP), and landslide frequency (LF). All these parameters were used to evaluate the spatial and temporal landslide distribution and evolution with the earthquake activity. These results can be considered as a powerful tool for earthquake-induced landslide disaster mitigation

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate efficacy and safety of mastoscopic skin sparing mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy combined with immediate mammary prosthesis reconstruction for early central breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients, who underwent mastoscopic skin sparing mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy combined with immediate mammary prosthesis reconstruction during the period of March 2011 and November 2016, were collected from Fuxing Hospital. Data on clinicopathologic characteristics, operative time, the number of resected sentinel lymph nodes, and complications were analyzed.RESULTS: The procedures were performed in 11 patients with central breast cancer. Among these patients, 10 patients were diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma, while the remaining patient had Paget's disease with infiltrating ductal carcinoma. The mean operation time was 148.2 minutes with minimal bleeding, and the median number of sentinel lymph nodes dissected from each operation was 4.6 The volume range of implants was 180-245 cc. There were no recurrences and upper limb swelling during the follow-up period. Merely two cases had sporadic axillary pain due to the mastoscopic lymph node dissection performed for the positive sentinel lymph nodes. All patients were satisfied with the reconstructive appearance.CONCLUSION: The present study shows that mastoscopic skin sparing mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy combined with immediate mammary prosthesis reconstruction is a feasible procedure for early central breast cancer.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Breast cancer is the most common type of invasive cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide. Correct staging of breast cancer is critical to the survival rate of the patients. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB), currently the gold standard technique for breast cancer staging, requires preoperative and intraoperative image guidance for noninvasive SLN identification and minimal surgical invasion. However, existing image guidance techniques suffer from a variety of limitations, such as ionizing radiation, high cost, and poor imaging depth. To address the clinical challenges, new methodology has to be developed. Methods: We developed a photoacoustic (PA) imaging procedure for noninvasive and nonradioactive SLN identification and biopsy guidance enhanced with a clinically-approved lymphatic tracer, i.e., carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) suspension injection. Results: In vivo experiments show that the proposed procedure could sensitively identify the SLN and provide high-contrast image guidance for fine-needle aspiration simulation. In addition, we demonstrated that CNPs have significantly better performance than other commonly-used contrast agents, such as methylene blue and indocyanine green. Conclusion: PA imaging technique using clinically-approved CNPs as the contrast agent is capable for noninvasive and nonradioactive SLN identification and high-contrast biopsy guidance, and should be considered as a new tool for assisting SLNB in breast cancer staging. Significance: The proposed CNPs-enhanced PA imaging technique provides a practical way for SLN identification and biopsy guidance for breast cancer patients and paves the way for clinical translation of PA SLN imaging.

TI  - Generating high-resolution daily soil moisture by using spatial downscaling techniques: a comparison of six machine learning algorithms
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tremendous efforts have been made for obtaining surface soil moisture (SM) at high spatial resolutions from microwave-based products via spatial downscaling. In recent years, machine learning has been one of the most advanced techniques in SM spatial downscaling. The performance of a machine learning technique in SM spatial downscaling varies with the algorithm and the underlying surface; however, despite the importance of machine learning for SM downscaling, there are still only few inter-comparisons, particularly over different surfaces. In this study, the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms in downscaling the ECV (the Essential Climate Variable Program initiated by the European Space Agency) SM dataset was validated over different underlying surfaces. Six machine learning algorithms: artificial neural network (ANN), Bayesian (BAYE), classification and regression trees (CART), K nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), were implemented to establish the spatial downscaling models with reliable continuous in-situ SM observations over four case study areas, including the Okalahoma Mesonet (OKM) in North America, Naqu network (NAN) in the Tibetan Plateau, REMEDHUS (REM) network in northeast Spain, and OZNNET (OZN) in southeast Australia. The land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), albedo, digital elevation model (DEM), and geographic coordinates were the explanatory variables, and their contributions to the downscaling models over different surfaces were quantified. The conclusions of the experiments can be summarized as follows: (1) The RF achieved excellent performance with a high correlation coefficient and a low regression error. The BAYE and KNN also demonstrated favorable capabilities for SM downscaling; however, the robustness of their algorithms needed further improvements. Numerous abnormal values were obtained in the scale-down process by the ANN, CART, and SVM methods, suggesting their comparative inadequacy in SM downscaling. (2) Downscaled 1-km resolution SM in REM generally presented a close correlation with the in-situ measurements, and its bias was larger than that in the other three regions. Comparatively, the smallest bias with the second highest correlation was found in the OZN region. It was primarily deduced that regions that located in one single climate zone and had mild topography variation and medium vegetation coverage tended to produce high-accuracy results. (3) The feature importance index (FII) calculated by the RF model revealed that the DEM, daytime LST, and NDVI were dominant during reconstruction, particularly DEM in a study region with a large height difference. The specific FII of each independent variable varied remarkably across the different case study areas, probably owing to the complex hydrothermal as well as physical geography conditions. The results of this study demonstrate that the RF model outperforms the other models considered herein; furthermore, the effect of the FII of the variables over different underlying surfaces was demonstrated.

TI  - Parameterization of a Bayesian Normalized Difference Water Index for Surface Water Detection
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference water index (NDWI) has been extensively used for different purposes, such as delineating and mapping surface water bodies and monitoring floods. However, the assessment of this index (based on multispectral remote sensing data) is highly affected by the effects of atmospheric aerosol scattering and built-up land, especially when green and near infrared bands are used. In this study, a modified version of the NDWI was developed to improve precision and reliability in the detection of water reservoirs from satellite images. The proposed equation includes eight different parameters. A Bayesian procedure was implemented for the identification of the optimal set of these parameters. The calculation of the index was based on Sentinel-2 satellite images of spectral bands collected over the 2015-2019 period. The modified NDWI was tested for the identification of small reservoirs in a subbasin of the Belice catchment in Sicily (southern Italy). To assess the effectiveness of the index, a reference image, representing the actual reservoirs in the study area, was used. The results suggested that the use of the proposed methodology for the parameterization of the modified NDWI improves the identification of water reservoirs with surfaces smaller than 0.1 ha.

T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Three hundred and fourteen red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in the province of Soria, Spain, were examined for hantavirus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection (and were likely to have been infected by feeding on infected rodents). Immunofluorescence and western blot assays confirmed 3.5% (11/314) to have antibodies to hantaviruses, and the immune fluorescence assay showed 2.2% (7/314) to have antibodies to LCMV. The serologic status of the animals showed no statistically significant association with sex or age. Although studies on the prevalence of hantaviruses and LCMV normally focus on rodents, our results showed that foxes can provide complementary information in determined areas.

TI  - Urban Heat Island in Moscow Derived from Satellite Data
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of surface temperature measurements in the Moscow region by Aqua and Terra satellites are presented for the period of 2008-2015. High correlations between radiometer data and station data on air temperature and surface temperature from the Meteorological Observatory of Mos cow State University are revealed. However, station data on surface temper ature in summer are overestimated by 15 degrees C as compared with satellite data due to the strong heating of the naked site with ground thermometers. The mean intensity of surface urban heat island in Moscow Delta T is 2.6 degrees C; it poorly depends on the selection of boundaries of comparison of the outer area with the city (at distances >60 km differences do not exceed +/- 0.1 degrees C). Numerical experiments demonstrate that if the cloud cover is not higher than 20% of the city area and 50% of the region area, a dis placement in the estimates of DT is small (+/- 0.2 of the value). According to station data at the time of satellite flights, the urban heat island intensity in the air temperature field over Moscow is lower than the corresponding intensity in the surface temperature field obtained from satellite data due to the sparse ground meteorological network and incomplete representativeness of station data (four of five city stations are located in green park zones). According to the ground network data, the intensity of the surface heat island in the daytime hours of satellite flight is by about three times smaller than the mean daily value. On the other hand, Delta T derived from satellite data is overestimated by similar to 40% due to the impact of anticyclones which enhance the heat island and allow the analysis of images. In the annual course, the surface heat island intensity is maximum in June and July (similar to 4.0 degrees C) and minimum in November (0.7 degrees C). The surface temperature field in the Moscow region is also characterized by the geo graphic zonality: a total increase in the values toward southeast.

TI  - Prognostic impact of the 8th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) cancer staging system on clinically negative lymph nodes (cN0) breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2017, the 8th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual released the updating of TNM. The new edition introduces changes concerning tumor classification that could have a real innovative and useful clinical impact. The purpose of the study is to compare anatomic vs. prognostic stage group introduced in the new edition of AJCC staging system and its importance in clinical practice. We retrospectively analyzed the prognostic stage group introduced by the 8th edition of the AJCC staging system for breast cancer. We restaged a large series of patients with infiltrative breast cancer from 2004 to 2017 applying the AJCC 8th Edition prognostic stage group criteria. This study included 1575 patients with all molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Our follow-up included disease-free survival (DFS), disease-related survival (DRS), and overall survival (OS) data. Kaplan-Meier test was used for statistical analysis. The median follow-up was 7 years. The 5-year and 10-year OS were 96% and 90%, respectively. From our analysis, according to the 8th edition, the majority of patients included in the cohort had a down-staging to a better prognostic group except the triple-negative tumors. Most of the anatomic stage IIA turned into IA and IB. This new staging system seems to better relate to prognosis. Therefore, the prognostic stage represents an important support in breast cancer management since it could avoid unnecessary and ineffective therapies; in contrast, it could help realize the global evaluation of the risk of relapse/response to specific treatments, leading to a significant reduction in the national health cost.

TI  - Estimating the Growing Stem Volume of the Planted Forest Using the General Linear Model and Time Series Quad-Polarimetric SAR Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing the area of planted forests is rather important for compensation the loss of natural forests and slowing down the global warming. Forest growing stem volume (GSV) is a key indicator for monitoring and evaluating the quality of planted forest. To improve the accuracy of planted forest GSV located in south China, four L-band ALOS PALSAR-2 quad-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were acquired from June to September with short intervals. Polarimetric characteristics (un-fused and fused) derived by the Yamaguchi decomposition from time series SAR images with different intervals were considered as independent variables for the GSV estimation. Then, the general linear model (GLM) obeyed the exponential distribution were proposed to retrieve the stand-level GSV in plantation. The results show that the un-fused power of double bounce scatters and four fused variables derived from single SAR image is highly sensitive to the GSV, and these polarimeric characteristics derived from the time series images more significantly contribute to improved estimation of GSV. Moreover, compared with the estimated GSV using the semi-exponential model, the employed GLM model with less limitations and simple algorithm has a higher saturation level (nearly to 300 m(3)/ha) and higher sensitivity to high forest GSV values than the semi-exponential model. Furthermore, by reducing the external disturbance with the help of time average, the accuracy of estimated GSV is improved using fused polarimeric characteristics, and the estimation accuracy of forest GSV was improved as the images increase. Using the fused polarimetric characteristics (DblxVol/Odd) and the GLM, the minimum RRMSE was reduced from 33.87% from single SAR image to 24.42% from the time series SAR images. It is implied that the GLM is more suitable for polarimetric characteristics derived from the time series SAR images and has more potential to improve the planted forest GSV.

TI  - SST Comparison of AVHRR and MODIS Time Series in the Western Mediterranean Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is a key parameter for understanding atmospheric and oceanic processes. Since the late 1980s, infrared satellite images have been used to complement in situ records for studying the temporal and spatial variability of SST. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s satellite was the first sensor successfully used to compute SST following the development and validation of the atmospheric correction algorithm known as "split-window". More recently, the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Terra and Aqua satellites, launched in 1999 and 2002, respectively, also provides SST products which can be combined with AVHRR series to complete the analysis of time series. This paper presents a comparison of the monthly SST data derived from both sensors, AVHRR and MODIS, in a series of ten years (2000-2009) in theWestern Mediterranean basins. The results showed a high correlation (R-2 = 0.99) between the sensors when averaged values at the regional scale were compared. SST obtained from AVHRR were slightly higher (+0.18 degrees C +/- 0.2 degrees C, on average) than SST from MODIS. The series were most similar during winter and spring (+0.09 degrees C +/- 0.1 degrees C for January to May) with a greater difference from June to December (+0.24 degrees C +/- 0.2 degrees C). The comparative analysis showed that the two sensors can be used jointly to estimate long-term trends at the regional scale.

TI  - Mapping small and medium-sized water reservoirs using Sentinel-1A: a case study in Chiapas, Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using satellite data to study small water bodies (SWB) and medium-sized water bodies (MSWB) is extremely useful for understanding their status, how to conserve them as water reservoirs, and their vulnerability to climate variability. The images studied in our work correspond to different-sized lagoons located in areas with high and low topography in a tropical region of Chiapas, Mexico. Our research project delineates SWB and MSWB. For this analysis, we considered water bodies to be uniform regions in a synthetic aperture radar image. The robustness of the method was determined based on an analysis of the morphologies of 23 lagoons. Several methods, including Hermite transform, were analyzed and compared with other image denoising methods used to improve speckle reduction. To obtain additional spatial information for image classification, we analyzed texture using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix. The results indicate that the Hermite filter is the best method for identifying water bodies. The advantage of this filter is the identification of local patterns such as edges and lines. It also preserves and improves aspects related to the homogeneity of water bodies, using the Hermite coefficient selection criteria for local pattern feature selection/extraction. The lake water extent products demonstrate that Sentinel-1 is useful for identifying SWB in this study area. The results show very high detection of water bodies, with adequate detection for water bodies larger than 2 ha, and an area accuracy of 80%.

TI  - Combining and Comparing an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Multiple Remote Sensing Satellites to Calculate Long-Term River Discharge in an Ungauged Water Source Region on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Research into global water resources is challenged by the lack of ground-based hydrometric stations and limited data sharing. It is difficult to collect good quality, long-term information about river discharges in ungauged regions. Herein, an approach was developed to determine the river discharges of 24 rivers in ungauged regions on the Tibetan Plateau on a long-term scale. This method involved coupling the Manning-Strickler formula, and data from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the Gaofen-2, SPOT-5, and Sentinel-2 satellites. We also compared the discharges calculated by using the three satellites' data. Fundamental information about the rivers was extracted from the UAV data. Comparison of the discharges calculated from the in-situ measurements and the UAV data gave an R(2)value of 0.84, an average NSE of 0.79, and an RMSE of 0.11 m(3)/s. The river discharges calculated with the GF-2 remote sensing data and the in-situ experiments for the same months were compared and the R-2, RMSE, and the NSE were 0.80, 1.8 m(3)/s, and 0.78, respectively. Comparing the discharges calculated over the long term from the measured in-situ data and the SPOT-5 and Sentinel-2 data gave R(2)values of 0.93 and 0.92, and RMSE values of 2.56 m(3)/s and 3.16 m(3)/s, respectively. The results showed that the GF-2 and UAV were useful for calculating the discharges for low-flow rivers, while the SPOT-5 or the Sentinel-2 satellite gave good results for high-flow river discharges in the long-term. Our results demonstrate that the discharges in ungauged tributaries can be reliably estimated in the long-term with this method. This method extended the previous research, which described river discharge only in one period and provided more support to the monitoring and management of the tributaries in ungauged regions.

M3  - Article
AB  - The social and political position of the Russian Orthodox Church during the Russian-Ukrainian crisis of 2014 and the following religious and political conflict with the Constantinople Patriarchate in 2018-2019 is down to the ambition to defend its interests, the integrity of the Church, the interests of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, and to the intention to play an independent role in the post-soviet space. Ukrainian events accelerated many processes and made them more evident. The latter includes the changes in the worldview of the Russian Orthodox Church. During the crisis, the idea of independence from the state, State-Church separation, human rights including the freedom of conscience enjoyed a high-profile. The attempt to develop the dioceses and the mission outside the "canonical territory" of the Russian Orthodox Church (as a result of a church split with Constantinople) probably will remain a symbolic step. Meanwhile, the involvement in the global mission widens the horizon of the representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church. The globalization project developed by the Moscow Patriarchate has the potential to strengthen the Church position as the major civil institution on post-soviet space. The Ukrainian crisis didn't destroy Russian Orthodoxy but gave a new impetus to its progress.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Skin Sea-Surface Temperature (SSTskin) derived from satellite measurements is one of the critical factors for determining ocean-atmosphere interactions in climate prediction and ocean research. Sentinel-3A is a European Earth Observation satellite mission developed to support ocean, land, and atmospheric applications. We compare three years of SSTskin from the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on board the Sentinel-3A satellite from July 2017-March 2019 with independent data from Marine-Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometers (M-AERIs) deployed on research cruises. The comparison results show an average difference of - 0.098 K and Robust Standard Deviation of 0.296 K between SLSTR and M-AERI SSTskin values; the average value meets the pre-launch scientific objective of a mean accuracy < 0.1 K. Differences between four SSTskin retrieval algorithms have been investigated, the results show that the Dual-view 3 channels night time algorithm (D3) is better than other algorithms. This study involves determining the error and uncertainty characteristics of the SST retrievals in terms of factors that influence the accuracies of the satellite SSTs, and we hope this information will be useful to improve the SLSTR atmospheric correction algorithms.

TI  - Mapping the fallowed area of paddy fields on Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China to assist water security assessments
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice growth requires a large amount of water, and planting rice will increase the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources. Paddy field fallowing is important for the sustainable development of an agricultural region, but it remains a great challenge to accurately and quickly monitor the extent and area of fallowed paddy fields. Paddy fields have unique physical features associated with paddy rice during the flooding and transplanting phases. By comparing the differences in phenology before and after paddy field fallowing, we proposed a phenology-based fallowed paddy field mapping algorithm. We used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and Landsat 8 images to extract the fallowed paddy field area on Sanjiang Plain of China in 2018. The results indicated that the Landsat8, GEE, and phenology-based fallowed paddy field mapping algorithm can effectively support the mapping of fallowed paddy fields on Sanjiang Plain of China. Based on remote sensing monitoring, the total fallowed paddy field area of Sanjiang Plain is 91 543 ha. The resultant fallowed paddy field map is of high accuracy, with a producer (user) accuracy of 83% (81%), based on validation using ground-truth samples. The Landsat-based map also exhibits high consistency with the agricultural statistical data. We estimated that paddy field fallowing reduced irrigation water by 384-521 million cubic meters on Sanjiang Plain in 2018. The research results can support subsidization grants for fallowed paddy fields, the evaluation of fallowed paddy field effects and improvement in subsequent fallowed paddy field policy in the future.

TI  - Improving Urban Land Cover/Use Mapping by Integrating A Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and An Automatic Training Sample Expanding Strategy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate spatial resolution (MSR) satellite images, which hold a trade-off among radiometric, spectral, spatial and temporal characteristics, are extremely popular data for acquiring land cover information. However, the low accuracy of existing classification methods for MSR images is still a fundamental issue restricting their capability in urban land cover mapping. In this study, we proposed a hybrid convolutional neural network (H-ConvNet) for improving urban land cover mapping with MSR Sentinel-2 images. The H-ConvNet was structured with two streams: one lightweight 1D ConvNet for deep spectral feature extraction and one lightweight 2D ConvNet for deep context feature extraction. To obtain a well-trained 2D ConvNet, a training sample expansion strategy was introduced to assist context feature learning. The H-ConvNet was tested in six highly heterogeneous urban regions around the world, and it was compared with support vector machine (SVM), object-based image analysis (OBIA), Markov random field model (MRF) and a newly proposed patch-based ConvNet system. The results showed that the H-ConvNet performed best. We hope that the proposed H-ConvNet would benefit for the land cover mapping with MSR images in highly heterogeneous urban regions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable and continuous information on major crop harvesting areas is fundamental to investigate land surface dynamics and make policies affecting agricultural production, land use, and sustainable development. However, there is currently no spatially explicit and time-continuous crop harvesting area information with a high resolution for China. The spatiotemporal patterns of major crop harvesting areas at a national scale have rarely been investigated. In this study, we proposed a new crop phenology-based crop mapping approach to generate a 1 km harvesting area dataset for three staple crops (i.e. rice, wheat, and maize) in China from 2000 to 2015 based on GLASS leaf area index (LAI) products. First, we retrieved key phenological dates of the three staple crops by combining the inflexion- and threshold-based methods. Then, we determined the grids cultivated for a certain crop if its three key phenological dates could be simultaneously identified. Finally, we developed crop classification maps and a dataset of annual harvesting areas (ChinaCropArea1 km), comprehensively considering the characteristics of crop phenology and the references of drylands and paddy fields. Compared with the county-level agricultural statistical data, the crop classification had a high accuracy, with R-2 values consistently greater than 0.8. The spatiotemporal patterns of major crop harvesting areas during the period were further analyzed. The results showed that paddy rice harvesting areas had expanded aggressively in northeastern China but decreased in southern China. Maize harvesting areas expanded substantially in major maize cultivation areas across China. Wheat harvesting areas declined overall, although they increased notably in their major production areas. The spatiotemporal patterns could be ascribed to various anthropogenic, biophysical, and social-economic drivers, including urbanization, reduced cropping intensity in southern China, frequent disasters from climate change, and large areas of abandoned farmland in northern and southwestern China. The resultant dataset can be applied for many purposes, including land surface modeling, agro-ecosystem modeling, agricultural production and land use policy-making.

TI  - Distinguishing Glaciers between Surging and Advancing by Remote Sensing: A Case Study in the Eastern Karakoram
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Karakoram has had an overall slight positive glacier mass balance since the end of 20th century, which is anomalous given that most other regions in High Mountain Asia have had negative changes. A large number of advancing, retreating, and surging glaciers are heterogeneously mixed in the Karakoram increasing the difficulties and inaccuracies to identify glacier surges. We found two adjacent glaciers in the eastern Karakoram behaving differently from 1995 to 2019: one was surging and the other was advancing. In order to figure out the differences existing between them and the potential controls on surges in this region, we collected satellite images from Landsat series, ASTER, and Google Earth, along with two sets of digital elevation model. Utilizing visual interpretation, feature tracking of optical images, and differencing between digital elevation models, three major differences were observed: (1) the evolution profiles of the terminus positions occupied different change patterns; (2) the surging glacier experienced a dramatic fluctuation in the surface velocities during and after the event, while the advancing glacier flowed in a stable mode; and (3) surface elevation of the surging glacier decreased in the reservoir and increased in the receiving zone. However, the advancing glacier only had an obvious elevation increase over its terminus part. These differences can be regarded as standards for surge identification in mountain ranges. After combining the differences with regional meteorological conditions, we suggested that changes of thermal and hydrological conditions could play a role in the surge occurrence, in addition, geomorphological characteristics and increasing warming climate might also be part of it. This research strongly contributes to the literatures of glacial motion and glacier mass change in the eastern Karakoram through remote sensing.

TI  - Forecasting grain yields of winter crops in Kherson oblast using satellite-based vegetation indices
T2  - BIOSCIENCE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The work is devoted to the development of an early grain yield prediction model for winter cereals (wheat and barley) for Kherson oblast by the values of spatial indices (normalized differential vegetation index NDVI and enhanced vegetation index EVI), calculated on the base of satellite data. For this purpose, we conducted a regression analysis of the data to determine the correlation between the yields of the above-mentioned crops by years (for the period of 2012-2019) with the values of the vegetation indices by the months of the studied period. The region-averaged vegetation indices were calculated based on a smoothed 250-m MODIS Terrain NDVI and MODIS Terrain EVI imaginary series using GDAL QGIS 3.10 raster analysis toolkit, excluding vegetation-free zones. Based on the results of the work, models of early (30 - 45 days before the start of mass harvesting) high-precision winter wheat and barley grain yields according to the regional NDVI and EVI are proposed. The novelty of the research is in the development of a convenient and high-precision forecasting tool for the identification of the risks connected with food shortage and planning a strategy for the region's export capabilities and calculation of the level of local grain supply.

TI  - Retrieval of High-Resolution Soil Moisture through Combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating soil moisture based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data remains challenging due to the influences of vegetation and surface roughness. Here we present an algorithm that simultaneously retrieves soil moisture, surface roughness and vegetation water content by jointly using high-resolution Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, with an application directed towards the provision of information at the precision agricultural scale. Sentinel-2-derived vegetation water indices are investigated and used to quantify the backscatter resulting from the vegetation canopy. The proposed algorithm then inverts the water cloud model to simultaneously estimate soil moisture and surface roughness by minimizing a cost function constructed by model simulations and SAR observations. To examine the performance of VV- and VH-polarized backscatters on soil moisture retrievals, three retrieval schemes are explored: a single channel algorithm using VV (SCA-VV) and VH (SCA-VH) polarizations and a dual channel algorithm using both VV and VH polarizations (DCA-VVVH). An evaluation of the approach using a combination of a cosmic-ray soil moisture observing system (COSMOS) and Soil Climate Analysis Network measurements over Nebraska shows that the SCA-VV scheme yields good agreement at both the COSMOS footprint and single-site scales. The features of the algorithms that have the most impact on the retrieval accuracy include the vegetation water content estimation scheme, parameters of the water cloud model and the specification of initial ranges of soil moisture and roughness, all of which are comprehensively analyzed and discussed. Through careful consideration and selection of these factors, we demonstrate that the proposed SCA-VV approach can provide reasonable soil moisture retrievals, with RMSE ranging from 0.039 to 0.078 m(3)/m(3)and R(2)ranging from 0.472 to 0.665, highlighting the utility of SAR for application at the precision agricultural scale.

TI  - Spatiotemporal pattern of gypsum blooms in the Salton Sea, California, during 2000-2018
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooms and the resulting deterioration of water quality have threatened the environmental health of inland lakes. This study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of gypsum blooms in the Salton Sea, the largest inland water body in California. An innovative gypsum bloom index (GI) was proposed to detect gypsum blooms based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra data for three bands (469, 555, and 859 nm) during 2000-2018. Discoloration (from green to reddish brown) was observed in the gypsum bloom-infested waters mapped using the hue, saturation, and value (HSV) color model. We found that: (1) the GI is able to effectively map gypsum blooms in the Salton Sea with a relatively high accuracy (85 %); (2) the largest gypsum bloom area was observed in summer (August and September), with notable gypsum blooms lasting more than 40 days in 2003, 2005, 2006, 2016, and 2018; (3) the gypsum bloom-infested waters shifted from the center to the southeastern shore of the lake during 2003-2018, and the frequency of gypsum blooms significantly increased since 2008. Meanwhile, the temporal and spatial differences between the northwestern and south-eastern lake increased over the observation period; and (4) discoloration occurred in the gypsum bloom-infested waters and lasted for 14 days on average, longer periods of discoloration (more than 20 days) occurred d in 2002, 2016, and 2018. The reconstruction of gypsum bloom dynamics in the Salton Sea provides valuable information for the practical management and restoration of the Salton Sea.

TI  - Generation of a Global Spatially Continuous TanSat Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Product by Considering the Impact of the Solar Radiation Intensity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides a new and direct way of monitoring photosynthetic activity. However, current SIF products are limited by low spatial resolution or sparse sampling. In this paper, we present a data-driven method of generating a global, spatially continuous TanSat SIF product. Firstly, the key explanatory variables for modelling canopy SIF were investigated using in-situ and satellite observations. According to theoretical and experimental analysis, the solar radiation intensity was found to be a dominant driving environmental variable for the SIF yield at both the canopy and global scales; this has, however, been neglected in previous research. The cosine value of the solar zenith angle at noon (cos (SZA(0))), a proxy for solar radiation intensity, was found to be a dominant abiotic factor for the SIF yield. Next, a Random Forest (RF) approach was employed for SIF prediction based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) visible-to-NIR reflectance data, the normalized difference vegetation (NDVI), cos (SZA(0)), and air temperature. The machine learning model performed well at predicting SIF, giving R(2)values of 0.73, an RMSE of 0.30 mW m(-2)nm(-1)sr(-1)and a bias of 0.22 mW m(-2)nm(-1)sr(-1)for 2018. If cos (SZA(0)) was not included, the accuracy of the RF model decreased: the R(2)value was then 0.65, the RMSE 0.34 mW m(-2)nm(-1)sr(-1)and an bias of 0.26 mW m(-2)nm(-1)sr(-1), further verifying the importance of cos (SZA(0)). Finally, the globally continuous TanSat SIF product was developed and compared to the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) SIF data. The results showed that the globally continuous TanSat SIF product agreed well with the TROPOMI SIF data, with an R(2)value of 0.73. Thus, this paper presents an improved approach to modelling satellite SIF that has a better accuracy, and the study also generated a global, spatially continuous TanSat SIF product with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees.

TI  - Spatial Analysis on Gold Mineralization in Southwest Saqqez Using Point Pattern, Fry and Fractal Analyses
T2  - GEOTECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Baneh- Saqqez zone is part of the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone, northwest of Iran. Generally, this zone is recognized as a gold bearing zone, and the mineralization in it is controlled by faults. In this research, structural lineaments were extracted using Landsat 8 (OLI) image, in which the main lineaments trend NE-SW, EW and NW-SE. Spatial distributions of the mineralization are examined by using the point pattern, Fry and fractal analyses. The pattern of structural controls on the gold mineralization in southwest Saqqez, is almost regular, and the trend of gold mineralization and Fry points show NE-SW and EW trends. Comparison of rose diagrams for the Fry analysis final translation points and faults in southwest Saqqez show that the orientations of mineralization are similar to NE-SW and EW trending faults and that the mineralization intersects the NW-SW trending faults. The results of fractal analysis suggest that gold occurrences in the area have higher fractal dimension. The deep regional faults cause a way for ore-bearing fluids to migrate and control the emplacement of the intrusive bodies and the position of ore mineralization in the Saqqez-Baneh sub-zone. On that basis, a survey of spatial data and its relationship to structural features can be useful for future exploration and discovery of new occurrences of gold mineralization.

TI  - Automated SAR Image Thresholds for Water Mask Production in Alberta's Boreal Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring surface water features is important for sustainably managing this critical natural resource that is in decline due to numerous natural and anthropogenic pressures. Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar is a popular and inexpensive solution for such exercises over large scales through the application of thresholds to distinguish water from non-water. Despite improvements to threshold methods, threshold selection is traditionally manual, which introduces subjectivity and inconsistency over large scales. This study presents a novel method for objectively determining and applying a threshold to determine water masks from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery on a scene-by-scene basis. The method was applied to Radarsat-2 and simulated Radarsat Constellation Mission scenes, and validated against two independent validation sources with high accuracy (Kappa ranging from 0.85 to 0.93). Expectedly, greatest misclassification occurs near shorelines, which are often ecologically important zones. Comparisons between Radarsat-2 and Radarsat Constellation Mission thresholds and outputs suggest that the latter is a capable successor for surface water applications. This work represents a foundational step toward objectivity and consistency in large-scale water mapping and monitoring.

TI  - Estimation of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) Phenology of a Short-Rotation Plantation Using Remotely Sensed Indices Derived from Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to understand which vegetation indices (VIs) are an ideal proxy for describing phenology and interannual variability of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) in short-rotation coppice (SRC) plantations. Canopy structure- and chlorophyll-sensitive VIs derived from Sentinel-2 images were used to estimate the start and end of the growing season (SOS and EOS, respectively) during the period 2016-2018, for an SRC poplar (Populusspp.) plantation in Lochristi (Belgium). Three different filtering methods (Savitzky-Golay (SavGol), polynomial (Polyfit) and Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS)) and five SOS- and EOS threshold methods (first derivative function, 10% and 20% percentages and 10% and 20% percentiles) were applied to identify the optimal methods for the determination of phenophases. Our results showed that the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) had the best fit with GPP phenology, as derived from eddy covariance measurements, in identifying SOS- and EOS-dates. For SOS, the performance was only slightly better than for several other indices, whereas for EOS, MTCI performed markedly better. The relationship between SOS/EOS derived from GPP and VIs varied interannually. MTCI described best the seasonal pattern of the SRC plantation's GPP (R-2= 0.52 when combining all three years). However, during the extreme dry year 2018, the Chlorophyll Red Edge Index performed slightly better in reproducing growing season GPP variability than MTCI (R-2= 0.59; R-2= 0.49, respectively). Regarding smoothing functions, Polyfit and HANTS methods showed the best (and very similar) performances. We further found that defining SOS as the date at which the 10% or 20% percentile occurred, yielded the best agreement between the VIs and the GPP; while for EOS the dates of the 10% percentile threshold came out as the best.

TI  - An assessment of temporal RADARSAT-2 SAR data for crop classification using KPCA based support vector machine
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop discrimination with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data primarily depends on the characterization of crop geometry using radar backscatter response. Differences in phenological development of crops lead to dissimilar temporal signatures of backscatter intensities, which may influence the separability of the crop classes. This principle leads to multi-date classification approach. In this work, kernel principal component (KPCA) is adopted for feature selection from multi-date datasets, and the selected features are used for classification using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The classification is investigated for both the KPCA-based SVM and only SVM approaches using quad-pol C-band RADARSAT-2 data acquired over the test site in Vijayawada, India. KPCA-based SVM classification shows an overall accuracy of 89%, which is better than 82% obtained using the SVM-based classification. The proposed methodology effectively incorporates the temporal crop information during classification.

TI  - Embedding "Smart" Disease Coding Within Routine Electronic Medical Record Workflow: Prospective Single-Arm Trial
T2  - JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Electronic medical record (EMR) chronic disease measurement can help direct primary care prevention and treatment strategies and plan health services resource management. Incomplete data and poor consistency of coded disease values within EMR problem lists are widespread issues that limit primary and secondary uses of these data. These issues were shared by the McMaster University Sentinel and Information Collaboration (MUSIC), a primary care practice-based research network (PBRN) located in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Objective: We sought to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of new EMR interface tools aimed at improving the quantity and the consistency of disease codes recorded within the disease registry across the MUSIC PBRN.Methods: We used a single-arm prospective trial design with preintervention and postintervention data analysis to assess the effect of the intervention on disease recording volume and quality. The MUSIC network holds data on over 75,080 patients, 37,212 currently rostered. There were 4 MUSIC network clinician champions involved in gap analysis of the disease coding process and in the iterative design of new interface tools. We leveraged terminology standards and factored EMR workflow and usability into a new interface solution that aimed to optimize code selection volume and quality while minimizing physician time burden. The intervention was integrated as part of usual clinical workflow during routine billing activities.Results: After implementation of the new interface (June 25, 2017), we assessed the disease registry codes at 3 and 6 months (intervention period) to compare their volume and quality to preintervention levels (baseline period). A total of 17,496 International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD9) code values were recorded in the disease registry during the 11.5-year (2006 to mid-2017) baseline period. A large gain in disease recording occurred in the intervention period (8516/17,496, 48.67% over baseline), resulting in a total of 26,774 codes. The coding rate increased by a factor of 11.2, averaging 1419 codes per month over the baseline average rate of 127 codes per month. The proportion of preferred ICD9 codes increased by 17.03% in the intervention period (11,007/17,496, 62.91% vs 7417/9278, 79.94%; chi(2)(1) =819.4; P<.001). A total of 45.03% (4178/9278) of disease codes were entered by way of the new screen prompt tools, with significant increases between quarters (Jul-Sep: 2507/6140, 40.83% vs Oct-Dec: 1671/3148, 53.08%; chi(2 )(1)=126.2; P<.001).Conclusions: The introduction of clinician co-designed, workflow-embedded disease coding tools is a very effective solution to the issues of poor disease coding and quality in EMRs. The substantial effectiveness in a routine care environment demonstrates usability, and the intervention detail described here should be generalizable to any setting. Significant improvements in problem list coding within primary care EMRs can be realized with minimal disruption to routine clinical workflow.

TI  - Investigating Live Fuel Moisture Content Estimation in Fire-Prone Shrubland from Remote Sensing Using Empirical Modelling and RTM Simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research has demonstrated that remote sensing can provide spectral information related to vegetation moisture variations essential for estimating live fuel moisture content (LFMC), but accuracy and timeliness still present challenges to using this information operationally. Consequently, many regional administrations are investing important resources in field campaigns for LFMC monitoring, often focusing on indicator species to reduce sampling time and costs. This paper compares different remote sensing approaches to provide LFMC prediction ofCistus ladanifer, a fire-prone shrub species commonly found in Mediterranean areas and used by fire management services as an indicator species for wildfire risk assessment. Spectral indices (SI) were derived from satellite imagery of different spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution, including Sentinel-2 and two different reflectance products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS); MCD43A4 and MOD09GA. The SI were used to calibrate empirical models for LFMC estimation using on ground field LFMC measurements from a monospecific shrubland area located in Madrid (Spain). The empirical models were fitted with different statistical methods: simple (LR) and multiple linear regression (MLR), non-linear regression (NLR), and general additive models with splines (GAMs). MCD43A4 images were also used to estimate LFMC from the inversion of radiative transfer models (RTM). Empirical model predictions and RTM simulations of LFMC were validated and compared using an independent sample of LFMC values observed in the field. Empirical models derived from MODIS products and Sentinel-2 data showed R(2)between estimated and observed LFMC from 0.72 to 0.75 and mean absolute errors ranging from 11% to 13%. GAMs outperformed regression methods in model calibration, but NLR had better results in model validation. LFMC derived from RTM simulations had a weaker correlation with field data (R-2= 0.49) than the best empirical model fitted with MCD43A4 images (R-2= 0.75). R(2)between observations and LFMC derived from RTM ranged from 0.56 to 0.85 when the validation was performed for each year independently. However, these values were still lower than the equivalent statistics using the empirical models (R(2)from 0.65 to 0.94) and the mean absolute errors per year for RTM were still high (ranging from 25% to 38%) compared to the empirical model (ranging 7% to 15%). Our results showed that spectral information derived from Sentinel-2 and different MODIS products provide valuable information for LFMC estimation inC. ladanifershrubland. However, both empirical and RTM approaches tended to overestimate the lowest LFMC values, and therefore further work is needed to improve predictions, especially below the critical LFMC threshold used by fire management services to indicate higher flammability (<80%). Although lower extreme LFMC values are still difficult to estimate, the proposed empirical models may be useful to identify when the critical threshold for high fire risk has been reached with reasonable accuracy. This study demonstrates that remote sensing data is a promising source of information to derive reliable and cost-effective LFMC estimation models that can be used in operational wildfire risk systems.

TI  - TRADITIONAL HERITAGE IN THE COLLECTION OF POEMS <i>BUNJEVACKI</i> <i>BLUES</i> (2003) BY TOMISLAV ZIGMANOV
T2  - ANAFORA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tomislav Zigman is an author who belongs to the mainland, northern and Pannonian sections of the literary corpus, according to many world-philosophical, traditional-cultural and linguistic determinants of his work. Bunjevacki blues is a collection of lyric songs / letters, which was released in two editions. This article deals with the second, extended edition from 2003. (Subotica). The collection is based on Bunjevci traditional-cultural stock such as linguistic heritage, traditional life, worldview and mentality characteristics, a clash of traditional and modern etc. First of all, these stocks are implied and visible in the motif- themed layer, which is absolutely rooted in the ikavian dialect of Bunjevci. Therefore, the article partly focuses on the stylistic stigmatization of the Bunjevci ikavian and and lexical forms in the rhythmic, melodic and semantic fabric of the poetic text. In addition, the traditional stimuli in the philosophical consciousness of the poem and the motif-thematic fabric of the poem are questioned, which give it quite characteristic features and make it a representative work of the Pannonian literary circle. An attempt is made to detect the inspirational and affective springs that lead the text to regional colourfulness and to establish a process of nuance of traditional and mentality specificities. Particularly noteworthy is the title entry, which is woven into poetic texts as a thought leitmotif and atmosphere omen, thus stimulating the recipient's horizon of expectation, inaugurating the text as a melancholy cantilena and referring to a commonly known musical jeremiad.

TI  - Estimating Chlorophyll-<i>a</i>of Inland Water Bodies in Greece Based on Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing chlorophyll-a(Chl-a) pigments in complex inland water systems is of key importance as this parameter constitutes a major ecosystem integrity indicator. In this study, a methodological framework is proposed for quantifying Chl-apigments using Earth observation (EO) data from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. The first step of the methodology involves the implementation of stepwise multiple regression (MLR) analysis of the available Chl-adataset. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is performed to explore Greek lakes' potential interrelationships based on their Chl-avalues in conjunction with certain criteria: their characteristics (artificial/natural), typology, and climatic type. Additionally, parameters such as seasonal water sampling and the date difference between sampling and satellite overpass are taken into consideration. Next, is implemented a stepwise multiple regression analysis among different groups of cases, formed by the criteria indicated from the PCA itself. This effort aimed at exploring different remote sensing-derived Chl-aalgorithms for various types of lakes. The practical use of the proposed approach was evaluated in a total of 50 lake water bodies (natural and artificial) from 2013-2018, constituting the National Lake Network Monitoring of Greece in the context of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). All in all, the results evidenced the suitability of Landsat data when used with the proposed technique to estimate log-transformed Chl-a. The proposed scheme resulted in the development of models separately for natural (R= 0.78; RMSE = 1.3 mu g/L) and artificial lakes (R= 0.76; RMSE = 1.29 mu g/L), while the model developed without criteria proved weaker (R= 0.65; RMSE = 1.85 mu g/L) in comparison to the other ones examined. The methodological framework proposed herein can be used as a useful resource toward a continuous monitoring and assessment of lake water quality, supporting sustainable water resources management.

TI  - The Zagreb (Croatia) M5.5 Earthquake on 22 March 2020
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - On 22 March 2020, Zagreb was struck by an M5.5 earthquake that had been expected for more than 100 years and revealed all the failures in the construction of residential buildings in the Croatian capital, especially those built in the first half of the 20th century. Because of that, extensive seismological, geological, geodetic and structural engineering surveys were conducted immediately after the main shock. This study provides descriptions of damage, specifying the building performances and their correlation with the local soil characteristics, i.e., seismic motion amplification. Co-seismic vertical ground displacement was estimated, and the most affected area is identified according to Sentinel-1 interferometric wide-swath data. Finally, preliminary 3D structural modeling of the earthquake sequence was performed, and two major faults were modeled using inverse distance weight (IDW) interpolation of the grouped hypocenters. The first-order assessment of seismic amplification (due to site conditions) in the Zagreb area for the M5.5 earthquake shows that ground motions of approximately 0.16-0.19 g were amplified at least twice. The observed co-seismic deformation (based on Sentinel-1A IW SLC images) implies an approximately 3 cm uplift of the epicentral area that covers approximately 20 km(2). Based on the preliminary spatial and temporal analyses of the Zagreb 2020 earthquake sequence, the main shock and the first aftershocks evidently occurred in the subsurface of the Medvednica Mountains along a deep-seated southeast-dipping thrust fault, recognized as the primary (master) fault. The co-seismic rupture propagated along the thrust towards northwest during the first half-hour of the earthquake sequence, which can be clearly seen from the time-lapse visualization. The preliminary results strongly support one of the debated models of the active tectonic setting of the Medvednica Mountains and will contribute to a better assessment of the seismic hazard for the wider Zagreb area.

TI  - Rapid COVID-19 Prognostic Blood Test for Disease Severity Using Epigenetic Immune System Biomarkers.
T2  - Delaware journal of public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a novel whole-blood epigenetic biomarker of immune system status, or EpiMarker, that would indicate whether a person with a recent COVID-19 diagnosis is at risk for severe symptoms including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.METHODS: Using a novel methyl-sensitive restriction endonuclease approach to measure site-specific DNA methylation profiles, immune system phentoype EpiMarkers are identified using a machine-learning computational bioinformatics platform. The result is a diagnostic network of 20 to 40 immuno DNA methylation sites having the greatest predictive power for identifying patients whose COVID-19 disease will likely progress to ARDS requiring ICU/intubation care.RESULTS: Immune system status in peripheral whole blood provides a sensitive and responsive sentinel signal reflecting how different functional pathways are currently being regulated in a subject. Deciphering this signal status of how immune cells are set to respond provides deep functional information regarding patient health and potential disease phenotypes resulting from a cytokine storm characteristic of a hyper immune inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection.CONCLUSIONS: The ability to identify future potential changes in patient health using this novel EpiMarker technology opens new avenues for defending populations from severe disease risks of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.POLICY IMPLICATIONS: A successful EpiMarker Assay for COVID-19 disease severity risk would allow for two important applications: (1) patients could be triaged early in the course of infection to allow for critical decisions for allocating resources, both in terms of hospital infrastructure (ICU beds, ventilators) and therapeutic drug treatments; and (2) pre-infection, individuals could be screened to identify personnel at low-risk for mission critical assignments (first responders, doctors, nurses, military personnel, etc.) during future pandemics and ongoing battles with viral pathogens like influenza.

TI  - Lymphaticovenous anastomosis: Treatment of a persistent breast seroma
T2  - ANNALES DE CHIRURGIE PLASTIQUE ESTHETIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphaticovenous anastomoses are mainly used in secondary limbs lymphedema. They also can be used to treat iatrogenic seroma. This technique was used to treat a patient with a painful breast seroma that appeared after a mastectomy with axillary dissection, resistant to multiple ponctions and persistent 8 months after. Pre operative both lymphoscintigraphy and lympho-MRI have been performed and we identified lymphatic ducts responsible for the seroma. The one involved in the seroma was also the preferential drainage network of the arm. Innoperative, we performed an indocyanine green angiography to map those lymphatic ducts. A total capsulectomy of the breast seroma has been performed. An incision was made in front of lymphatics selected for lymphaticovenous anastomoses on the anterior axilla face. We performed two microscopic lymphaticovenous anastomoses. The patient was followed up at one, three, six months and one year post operative. No recurrence occurred during the follow-up. At six month the arm perimeter reduced of two centimeters. Lymphoscintigraphy and lympho-MRI were performed at six month showing a disappearance of the drainage asymmetry and collateralities of the upper limb; and no measurable volume in projection of the right breast area. Lymphaticovenous anastomoses may be an effective therapeutic solution for resistant seroma after node dissection. Lymphoscintigraphy and lympho IRM are very useful in those cases.

TI  - Mapping Coastal Dune Landscape through Spectral Rao's Q Temporal Diversity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal dunes are found at the boundary between continents and seas representing unique transitional mosaics hosting highly dynamic habitats undergoing substantial seasonal changes. Here, we implemented a land cover classification approach specifically designed for coastal landscapes accounting for the within-year temporal variability of the main components of the coastal mosaic: vegetation, bare surfaces and water surfaces. Based on monthly Sentinel-2 satellite images of the year 2019, we used hierarchical clustering and a Random Forest model to produce an unsupervised land cover map of coastal dunes in a representative site of the Adriatic coast (central Italy). As classification variables, we used the within-year diversity computed through Rao's Q index, along with three spectral indices describing the main components of the coastal mosaic (i.e., Modified Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index 2-MSAVI2, Normalized Difference Water Index 2-NDWI2 and Brightness Index 2-BI2). We identified seven land cover classes with high levels of accuracy, highlighting different covariates as the most important in differentiating them. The proposed framework proved effective in mapping a highly seasonal and heterogeneous landscape such as that of coastal dunes, highlighting Rao's Q index as a sound base for natural cover monitoring and mapping. The applicability of the proposed framework on updated satellite images emphasizes the procedure as a reliable and replicable tool for coastal ecosystems monitoring.

TI  - Port Bathymetry Mapping Using Support Vector Machine Technique and Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the free draft of ports is essential for the adequate management of ports. To maintain these drafts, it is necessary to carry out dredging periodically, and to conduct bathymetries using traditional techniques, such as echo sounding. However, an echo sounder is very expensive and its accuracy is subject to weather conditions. Thus, the use of recent advancements in remote sensing techniques provide a better solution for mapping and estimating the evolution of the seabed in these areas. This paper presents a cost-effective and practical method for estimating satellite-derived bathymetry for highly polluted and turbid waters at two different ports in the cities of Luarca and Candas in the Principality of Asturias (Spain). The method involves the use of the support vector machine (SVM) technique and open Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, which the European Space Agency has supplied. Models were compared to the bathymetries that were obtained from the in situ data collected by a single beam echo sounder that the Port Service of the Principality of Asturias provided. The most accurate values of the training and testing dataset in Candas, were R-2= 0.911 and RMSE = 0.3694 m, and R-2= 0.8553 and RMSE = 0.4370 m, respectively. The accuracies of the training and testing dataset values in Luarca were R-2= 0.976 and RMSE = 0.4409 m, and R-2= 0.9731 and RMSE = 0.4640 m, respectively. The regression analysis results of the training and testing dataset were consistent. The approaches that have been developed in this work may be included in the monitoring of future dredging activities in ports, especially where the water is polluted, muddy and highly turbid.

TI  - Impact of radiation frequency, precipitation radiative forcing, and radiation column aggregation on convection-permitting West African monsoon simulations
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the impact of different configurations of the Goddard radiation scheme on convection-permitting simulations (CPSs) of the West African monsoon (WAM) is investigated using the NASA-Unified WRF (NU-WRF). These CPSs had 3 km grid spacing to explicitly simulate the evolution of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and their interaction with radiative processes across the WAM domain and were able to reproduce realistic precipitation and energy budget fields when compared with satellite data, although low clouds were overestimated. Sensitivity experiments reveal that (1) lowering the radiation update frequency (i.e., longer radiation update time) increases precipitation and cloudiness over the WAM region by enhancing the monsoon circulation, (2) deactivation of precipitation radiative forcing suppresses cloudiness over the WAM region, and (3) aggregating radiation columns reduces low clouds over ocean and tropical West Africa. The changes in radiation configuration immediately modulate the radiative heating and low clouds over ocean. On the 2nd day of the simulations, patterns of latitudinal air temperature profiles were already similar to the patterns of monthly composites for all radiation sensitivity experiments. Low cloud maintenance within the WAM system is tightly connected with radiation processes; thus, proper coupling between microphysics and radiation processes must be established for each modeling framework.

TI  - Correction of Canopy Shadow Effects on Reflectance in an Evergreen Conifer Forest Using a 3D Point Cloud
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Correction of spectral reflectance for shadow and topography in optical remote sensing data is challenging. Here, we corrected for canopy self-shadowing in an evergreen conifer forest in mountainous terrain using a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud. In our approach, the surface was modeled from structure-from-motion processed images provided by an unmanned aerial vehicle; then, the relationship between the observed spectral reflectance of the Sentinel-2A/B multispectral instrument, and the simulated sunlit fraction (the percentage of the solar-illuminated area within a Sentinel-2 pixel) was determined based on a ray-tracing scheme using a 3D point cloud. Scene-based and pixel-based linear regressions were applied to remove canopy-shadow and topographic effects from satellite-observed reflectance. Scene-based regression resulted in large seasonal changes that caused overcorrection in winter. Pixel-based regression generated stable seasonal profiles in both the red and near-infrared reflectance values over the conifer canopy; however, excessively smoothed seasonal changes were implemented over deciduous vegetation. In both correction methods, the reflection of incident light by the canopy likely improved the correction accuracy by decreasing the contrast between illuminated and shaded pixels in summer and increasing it in winter. The results were also visually compared with those from the Sun-Canopy-Sensor with C (SCS+C) method and the Sentinel-2 Level-2A product. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of using a 3D point cloud to correct for self-shadowing and topographic effects on remotely sensed reflectance.

TI  - Sentinel node mapping for post-endoscopic resection gastric cancer: multicenter retrospective cohort study in Japan
T2  - GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Standard gastrectomy with systematic lymphadenectomy as an additional surgery after endoscopic resection (ER) causes a deterioration in long-term quality of life. If the sentinel lymph node (SN) basin concept can be applied in post-ER gastric cancer, minimal surgery can be applied without reducing the curability. This retrospective multicenter cohort study aimed to verify the validity of the SN basin concept in post-ER gastric cancer. Patients and methods Individual data of 132 patients who underwent SN mapping after ER were collected from 8 university hospitals in Japan from 2001 to 2016. Tracers were injected endoscopically in the submucosal layer at four sites around the post-ER scar. We compared the SN basin distribution of post-ER gastric cancer with that of 275 patients with non-ER gastric cancer. Results Two cases of SN were unidentified, both involving a single tracer (SN detection rate: 98.5%). Nine cases (6.8%) of lymph node metastasis were found, of which eight had a metastatic lymph node within the SNs and one had a non-SN metastasis within the SN basin. The diagnostic sensitivity of SN mapping for lymph node metastasis was 88.9% in post-ER group and 95.7% in non-ER group (P = 0.490); the accuracy was 99.2% and 99.6% (P = 0.539), respectively. Regarding the SN basin, no significant intergroup differences were found regardless of the primary tumor location. Conclusions Our findings clarified the feasibility of SN mapping based on the SN basin concept in patients with gastric cancer who previously underwent ER.

TI  - Variations in grizzly bear habitat selection in relation to the daily and seasonal availability of annual plant-food resources
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining how resource availability changes daily, seasonally and annually, and how wildlife react to these changes, is valuable for managing wildlife. For vegetative resources phenological information can be used to determine availability and model the distribution of available resources. This study develops a set of annually varying species distribution models using maximum entropy modeling for eight grizzly bear key plant-food species using 1635 food occurrences collected between 2001 and 2017. Seasonal availability (phenology) of plant-food species were then estimated daily at a 30 m resolution for the period 2000-2017 using ground data collected at 15 sites in 2015 and 2018 combined with newly created fine scale phenology product DRIVE (Daily Remote Inference of Vegetation). These food availability layers were then used to develop resource selection functions with grizzly bear GPS collar data to describe daily and seasonal habitat selection and to compared how this changes over a three-year period based on changes in mean annual precipitation. Results demonstrated that grizzly bears selected areas where key plant-food species were available and that habitat selection varied between wet and dry years dependant on season and species. In dry spring conditions, selection for root species was stronger and occurred earlier than for an average and wet year. In the wet summer, length of selection for forb species increased, while strength of selection for wet and dry years was species dependant. In the fall, strength of selection for berry species between wet and dry years was species dependant, but overall selection for berry species was prolonged in the dry fall year. This research aids in predicting how inter-annual differences in climate affect grizzly bear habitat selection and provides insights to managers regarding how changes in management practices that encourage growth of understory vegetation could be used to maximize food resources regionally for grizzly bears and other wildlife.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Changes and Associated Impacts on Water Yield Availability and Variations in the Mereb-Gash River Basin in the Horn of Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate variability and drought are increasing in the Horn of Africa. Evaluating land use/land cover (LULC) changes and their impacts on water availability and variation are vital for regional land use planning and water resources management. LULC changes during 2000-2015 were estimated using high-resolution Landsat images and the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, and land use dynamic index (K). The impact of LULC change on water yield was evaluated using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoff (InVEST) model. The results at a regional scale show that there were rapid decreases in the area of forests and barren lands (-K) while there was a drastic increase in the built-up area (+Kvalues). The transition was found to occur from forested land to low and very low biomass areas with 51.13% and 16.7%, respectively. There were similar LULC changes in the Mereb-Gash River Basin. The mean annual water yield increased for all the catchments during 2000-2015 and with the peak in 2005. The highest annual sum water yield decreased in the forested lands from 43.18 million m(3)in 2000 to 4.1 million m(3)in 2015. There was a strong positive correlation between areal changes (%) and the annual water yield variations (%) for all the LULC types except for water body, and the correlation was significantly positive for forest (p < 0.01). The study demonstrates that the decrease in forested areas and expansion in the built-up areas had large impacts on water yield. The impacts may increase pressure on ecosystem services, exacerbate water scarcity, and food insecurity.

TI  - Preoperative Assessment of the Axilla by Ultrasonogram-Guided FNAC in Breast Cancer Patients with a Clinically Negative Axilla
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ultrasonogram-guided fine needle aspiration cytology of the axillary lymph nodes using a 7-12 MHz linear transducer was carried out on 102 breast cancer patients in whom there was no clinically palpable lymph node in the axilla. Ultrasound was able to visualize an axillary node in 55 patients (54%) while in 47 patients (46%), no node was visualized. USG-guided FNAC on the 55 patients found 9 (16%) patients to be positive for metastases, 27 (49%) to be negative, and 19 (35%) in whom an inconclusive or inadequate sample was reported. On correlation with post-modified radical mastectomy (MRM) histopathology, the preoperative USG-guided FNAC had a sensitivity of 60%, specificity of 100%, and an overall diagnostic accuracy of 58%. It can be concluded that patients with a positive for malignancy USG-guided FNAC report on the axilla should be treated as such. Patients who have a negative for malignancy or inconclusive/inadequate FNAC report or in patients in whom no axillary node is visualized on USG should undergo a sentinel node biopsy procedure for further evaluation of the axilla.

TI  - Spatial and Spectral Joint Super-Resolution Using Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many applications have benefited from the images with both high spatial and spectral resolution, such as mineralogy and surveillance. However, it is difficult to acquire such images due to the limitation of sensor technologies. Recently, super-resolution (SR) techniques have been proposed to improve the spatial or spectral resolution of images, e.g., improving the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images (HSIs) or improving spectral resolution of color images (reconstructing HSIs from RGB inputs). However, none of the researches attempted to improve both spatial and spectral resolution together. In this article, these two types of resolution are jointly improved using convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, two kinds of CNN-based SR are conducted, including a simultaneous spatial-spectral joint SR (SimSSJSR) that conducts SR in spectral and spatial domain simultaneously and a separated spatial-spectral joint SR (SepSSJSR) that considers spectral and spatial SR sequentially. In the proposed SimSSJSR, a full 3-D CNN is constructed to learn an end-to-end mapping between a low spatial-resolution mulitspectral image (LR-MSI) and the corresponding high spatial-resolution HSI (HR-HSI). In the proposed SepSSJSR, a spatial SR network and a spectral SR network are designed separately, and thus two different frameworks are proposed for SepSSJSR, namely SepSSJSR1 and SepSSJSR2, according to the order that spatial SR and spectral SR are applied. Furthermore, the least absolute deviation, instead of mean square error (MSE) in traditional SR networks, is chosen as the loss function for the proposed networks. Experimental results over simulated images from different sensors demonstrated that the proposed SepSSJSR1 is most effective to improve spatial and spectral resolution of MSIs sequentially by conducting spatial SR prior to spectral SR. In addition, validation on real Landsat images also indicates that the proposed SSJSR techniques can make full use of available MSIs for high-resolution-based analysis or applications.

TI  - Influence of topography and fuels on fire refugia probability under varying fire weather conditions in forests of the Pacific Northwest, USA
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire refugia - locations that burn less severely or less frequently than surrounding areas - support late-successional and old-growth forest structure and function. This study investigates the influence of topography and fuels on the probability of forest fire refugia under varying fire weather conditions. We focused on recent large fires in Oregon and Washington, United States (n = 39 fires > 400 ha, 2004-2014). Our objectives were to (1) map fire refugia as a component of the burn severity gradient, (2) quantify the predictability of fire refugia as a function of prefire fuels and topography under moderate and high fire weather conditions, and (3) map the conditional probability of fire refugia to illustrate their spatial patterns in old-growth forests. Fire refugia exhibited higher predictability under relatively moderate fire weather conditions. Prefire live fuels were strong predictors of fire refugia, with higher refugia probability in forests with higher prefire biomass. In addition, fire refugia probability was higher in topographic settings with relatively northern aspects, steep catchment slopes, and concave topographic positions. Conditional probability maps revealed consistently higher fire refugia probability under moderate versus high fire weather scenarios. Results from this study inform conservation planning by determining late-successional forests most likely to persist as fire refugia despite increasing regional fire activity.

TI  - Regional soil organic carbon prediction model based on a discrete wavelet analysis of hyperspectral satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Most studies have the achieved rapid and accurate determination of soil organic carbon (SOC) using laboratory spectroscopy; however, it remains difficult to map the spatial distribution of SOC. To predict and map SOC at a regional scale, we obtained fourteen hyperspectral images from the Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite and decomposed and reconstructed the original reflectance (OR) and the first derivative reflectance (FDR) using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) at different scales. At these different scales, as inputs, we selected the 3 optimal bands with the highest weight coefficient using principal component analysis and chose the normalized difference index (NDI), ratio index (RI) and difference index (DI) with the strongest correlation with the SOC content using a contour map method. These inputs were then used to build regional-scale SOC prediction models using random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms. The results indicated that: 1) at a low decomposition scale, DWT can effectively eliminate the noise in satellite hyperspectral data, and the FDR combined with DWT can improve the SOC prediction accuracy significantly; 2) the method of selecting inputs using principal component analysis and a contour map can eliminate the redundancy of hyperspectral data while retaining the physical meaning of the inputs. For the model with the highest prediction accuracy, the inputs were all derived from the wavelength range of SOC variations; 3) the differences in prediction accuracy among the different prediction models are small; and 4) the SOC prediction accuracy using hyperspectral satellite data is greatly improved compared with that of previous SOC prediction studies using multispectral satellite data. This study provides a highly robust and accurate method for predicting and mapping regional SOC contents.

TI  - Effect of Lockdown Measures on Atmospheric Nitrogen Dioxide during SARS-CoV-2 in Spain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected many countries and regions. In order to contain the spread of infection, many countries have adopted lockdown measures. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 has negatively influenced economies on a global scale and has caused a significant impact on the environment. In this study, changes in the concentration of the pollutant Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) within the lockdown period were examined as well as how these changes relate to the Spanish population. NO(2)is one of the reactive nitrogen oxides gases resulting from both anthropogenic and natural processes. One major source in urban areas is the combustion of fossil fuels from vehicles and industrial plants, both of which significantly contribute to air pollution. The long-term exposure to NO(2)can also cause severe health problems. Remote sensing is a useful tool to analyze spatial variability of air quality. For this purpose, Sentinel-5P images registered from January to April of 2019 and 2020 were used to analyze spatial distribution of NO(2)and its evolution under the lockdown measures in Spain. The results indicate a significant correlation between the population's activity level and the reduction of NO(2)values.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Variation Characteristics of Vertical Dust Flux Simulated by WRF-Chem Model with GOCART and AFWA Dust Emission Schemes (Case Study: Central Plateau of Iran)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application Identify of dust hotspots. Dust and sand storms are among the major threats to central Iran. These phenomena pose irreparable risks to natural ecosystems and human societies, including effects on health. In this study, the spatial and temporal pattern of vertical dust flux (VDF) was used to identify dust sources as well as areas with high potential for dust generation. To simulate VDF, two intense dust storms, from 21 February 2015 and 14 February 2018, were selected using synoptic data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. These dust storms were identified as responsible for a reduction of horizontal visibility to less than 1000 m, using remote sensing tools and Ackerman Dust Index. MODIS images show that these two storms covered most of Central Plateau of Iran. The Weather Research and Forecasting model with chemistry (WRF-Chem) was used to simulate the storms, with either the Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) or Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) scheme to calculate VDF. Modeled vertical dust fluxes in both events indicate that the Arabian deserts in Saudi Arabia and in southwestern Iran can be identified as main sources of the dust in the central Iranian plateau. The other source of dust is the Hirmand Basin, located in the country of Afghanistan and in the southeast of Iran. The results of VDF simulations indicate that central southeast Iran could be the main dust source of internal origin. Additionally, over seasonal wetlands in Iran, the amount of VDF was simulated to be sometimes over 4000 mu g/(m(2)s), an indication that these areas are sensitive to wind erosion in dry conditions and can be a source of dust. The WRF-Chem results were compared with the horizontal visibility measured in synoptic stations in the area. The results showed that the coefficients of determination of GOCART results with the measured horizontal visibility on 21 February 2015 and 14 February 2018 were 0.72 and 0.76, respectively, while the coefficient values from the simulations with AFWA scheme on 21 February 2015 and 14 February 2018 with the measured horizontal visibility were lower, 0.44 and 0.50, respectively. Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA2) re-analysis data also showed timing of peak dust levels consistent with the GOCART scheme.

TI  - Characterization of laser-induced vibration on concrete surface toward highly efficient laser remote sensing
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Laser remote sensing (LRS) using irradiation of high-power laser pulses provides characteristic vibrations (CVs) which are accompanied by internal deterioration. While the principle of LRS is the same as that of the traditional hammering inspection, optimizing the irradiation parameters of laser pulses for vibrating samples is essential for effective LRS. In this study, the frequencies and magnitudes of CVs on a concrete specimen exhibiting a mock inside defect were evaluated by laser pulse irradiation and pendulum impact. When laser pulses were irradiated, the magnitude of CVs increased linearly with increasing laser pulse energy, and higher-order vibration was observed. On the other hand, an optimal spot size was indicated by the non-linear correlation between the fluence and the magnitude of CVs. To obtain an effective LRS, we propose that both high laser fluence and an optimized laser spot size are essential.

TI  - Indigenous knowledge of terrace management for soil and water conservation in the Sikkim Himalaya, India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study was to understand the farmer's indigenous knowledge of terrace management in the Sikkim Himalaya with reference to Rani Khola watershed. Primary data were collected through a mix of questionnaire surveys, focused group discussions, and field observations with a sample size of 300 households. Detailed documentation of the evolution of the terraces and their types, bunding material, types of risers, the relationship of slope and terraces dimensions, soil and water conservation (SWC) practices were performed. Remote sensing data was used to derive information pertaining to elevation, slope and land-use/cover of the watershed. The study reveals that dimensions and types of terraces are subjected to the elevation, slope gradient, local soil and vegetation cover. Leveled terraces were constructed on lower slopes while outward sloping terraces were more common on higher slopes. It was also observed that with the increase in slope angle, width and length of the terraces decreased. Terrace riser height was also correlated with slope; riser height unavoidably increased as slope increased. The study concludes that terraces in the study watershed are effective in reducing the slope gradient and length, and in turn helpful in trapping eroded soil, slowing soil movement and in due course reducing soil erosion and increasing agricultural productivity. It is suggested that for overall management of terraces, it needs to be combined with additional soil and water conservation practices.

TI  - Monitoring of Changes in Land Use/Land Cover in Syria from 2010 to 2018 Using Multitemporal Landsat Imagery and GIS
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the effects of socio-ecological shocks on land use/land cover (LULC) change is essential for developing land management strategies and for reducing adverse environmental pressures. Our study examines the impacts of the armed conflict in Syria, which began in mid-2011, and the related social and economic crisis on LULC between 2010 and 2018. We used remote sensing for change detection by applying a supervised maximum likelihood classification to Landsat images of the three target years 2010, 2014, and 2018. Based on the computed extent of our LULC classes and accuracy assessment, we calculated area-adjusted estimates and 95% confidence intervals. Our classification achieved an overall accuracy of 86.4%. Compared to 2010, we found an increase in spatial extent for bare areas (40,011 km(2)), forests (2576 km(2)), and urban and peri-urban areas (3560 km(2)), whereas rangelands (37,005 km(2)) and cultivated areas (9425 km(2)) decreased by 2018. It is not possible to determine whether the changes in LULC in Syria will be permanent or temporary. Natural conditions such as climate fluctuations had an impact on the uses of the natural environment and cultivated areas during the study period, especially in regions suffering from water stress. Although seasonal precipitation patterns and temperature affect LULC change, however, we could not identify a prevailing climate trend towards more drought-prone conditions. Our analysis focuses on (potential) direct and indirect implications of the Syrian conflict on LULC change, which most notably occurred between 2014 and 2018. Conflict-related main drivers were human activities and demographic changes, which are mainly attributable to large-scale population displacement, military operations, concomitant socio-economic status, and control of local resources. As the study provides quantitative and qualitative information on the dynamics of LULC changes in Syria, it may serve as a framework for further relevant conflict-related research and support planning, management practices, and sustainable development.

TI  - Industrial heat island: a case study of Angul-Talcher region in India
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the urban heat island (UHI) studies are carried out in densely populated cities but core industrial areas are also potential sites of heat island effect despite having a comparatively lower population. In the present study, heat island assessment has been carried out for Angul-Talcher industrial area (ATIA) which is one of the oldest industrial areas of India and is still undergoing a transformation to accommodate more industries and mining operations. As the major contributors towards influencing local meteorology were expected to be industrial (and mining) activities, the heat island was studied as "industrial heat island" (IHI) rather than urban heat island. Industrial and mining sites were the most frequent nighttime canopy-layer heat island intensity (HIN) hotspots due to anthropogenic heat of associated industrial processes as well as built structures. During the daytime, croplands experienced the most frequent canopy-layer HIN hotspots which could be attributed to low moisture of the soils during the non-farming period of the field campaign. Hourly maximum atmospheric heat island intensities were observed in the range of 7-9 degrees C. Monthly maximum HINs ranged from 2.97 to 4.04 degrees C while 3-month mean HINs varied from 1.45 to 2.74 degrees C. Amongst different land use/land cover classes, the highest mean canopy-layer heat island intensity for the entire 3-month-long duration of field campaign during nighttime was assessed at the mining sites (3-month mean 2.74 degrees C) followed in decreasing order by the industrial sites (2.52 degrees C), rural and urban settlements (2.13 degrees C), and croplands (2.06 degrees C). Corresponding daytime canopy-layer heat island intensity was highest for the croplands (2.07 degrees C) followed in decreasing order by the mining sites (1.70 degrees C), rural and urban settlements (1.68 degrees C), and industry (1.45 degrees C).

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES AND AIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Integrated counseling and testing center (ICTC) forms the major forum under the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) for counseling and testing of HIV-suspected patients. ICTC setup in a tertiary care institute also provides a chance for opportunistic screening of large number of individuals. Aims: The study was done to assess and to profile the ICTC clients with respect to their seropositivity rate, their biological and behavioral risk factors, and seroconcordance rate. Methodology: We did a secondary analysis of routine health data collected in the ICTC in the formats prescribed by the NACO. Statistical Data Analysis: The data were entered into MS Excel and analyzed using SPSS version 22. Results: Majority of the clients of ICTC were in the age group of 35-49 years. Seropositivity among client-initiated group (11.9%) was much higher compared to provider-initiated group (0.3%). None of the pregnant women were found to be positive. Heterosexual route was most common form of transmission in both provider-initiated and client-initiated groups. Seroconcordance rate was 43.4% in our study. Conclusion: The ICTC of a tertiary care center attracted a huge number of patients. The seropositivity in our study was greater than those generated by sentinel surveillance system. A well-functioning ICTC can help in detecting a large number of cases and also provide a forum for counseling and education about risk factors of HIV.

TI  - Enhanced iceberg drift modelling in the Barents Sea with estimates of the release rates and size characteristics at the major glacial sources using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers with termini at sea level may calve glacial ice features that can pose threats to offshore installations in the Barents Sea, especially in the central and northern part of this sea. It is therefore of great importance to estimate the annual iceberg encounter frequencies to select robust concepts for offshore field development, to design offshore structures and possibly to plan ice management operations. These encounter frequencies are often estimated using numerical models. Regardless of the model, considerable uncertainties often exist in the input data of icebergs at the sources, i.e., the annual number of icebergs released at the source and their size characteristics. The aim of this work is to reduce these uncertainties by utilizing state-of-the-art satellite remote sensing data and a complementary numerical model of iceberg drift and deterioration. Iceberg length and width distributions derived using Sentinel-2 optical imagery are presented at the major iceberg sources in the Barents Sea, which are Franz Josef Land, the eastern side of Svalbard and Novaya Zemlya. Over 22,000 icebergs were manually identified, with the largest observed iceberg being approximately 1 km long, originating from Franz Josef Land. Furthermore, a methodology is proposed to estimate the annual number of icebergs released into the Barents Sea by comparing the model results against Copernicus iceberg density data derived from the satellite synthetic aperture radar system onboard Sentinel-1. The importance of satellite remote sensing data cannot be understated because it is undoubtedly the best way to calibrate and validate the results of numerical iceberg drift models. Finally, with the calibrated model and the derived iceberg size, a map of the Barents Sea with updated annual iceberg encounter frequencies is presented.

TI  - Assessing Quality of Life Across Mexico City Using Socio-Economic and Environmental Factors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOSPATIAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban quality of life studies increasingly incorporate both socio-economic and environmental factors into their analyses, yet few studies have explored how the socio-economic factors relate to the environmental conditions or how to statistically describe the spatial patterns of quality of life as they relate to the socio-economic and environmental structure of a city. This paper evaluates a quality of life index for Mexico City that takes into account both social and environmental factors through a factor analysis and explores the relationship between the contributing environmental and social factors through a regression analysis. The spatial patterns of quality of life across the city are then examined using a geographic clustering technique. Results indicate that both socio-economic and environmental segregation characterize the physical structure of Mexico City and suggest that the peripheral areas of the city suffer from poor socio-economic conditions even though they have positive environmental conditions.

TI  - Fragmentation dynamics in an <i>Abies religiosa</i> forest of central Mexico
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fir (Abies Mill.) forests of Mexico are relicts of the boreal forests that advanced southwards during glaciation periods. Mexico is a center of diversification of the Abies genus, as there are eight species in its territory, six of which are endemic. The forests of Abies religiosa (Kunth) Schltdl. & Cham. near Mexico City are subject to a process of deterioration. We analyzed the fragmentation dynamics of the A. religiosa forest in the northern region of the Sierra Nevada, Mexico. Land cover change detection was done by means of high-resolution images acquired by the SPOT satellite in 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018. Habitat fragmentation was observed, with a decrease in the size of dense Abies masses. The area covered by Abies decreased by 22.9%. The area occupied by forest openings increased 3% from 2005 to 2010 and then decreased by 1.8% and 1.6% in the following periods. The land patch type Other Forest Cover increased in both frequency and size, with the area increasing by 23.3%, which warns of a change process towards this patch type. The formation of increasingly smaller and isolated remnants of A. religiosa forest in the Sierra Nevada can lead to the loss of this vegetation relict and its replacement by other types of cover in the short term.

AB  - Spatial and temporal variations and trends of SST and Chl-a in the Persian Gulf were evaluated using MODIS data from 2002 to 2018. Trend indicator and key features were built up based on Mann-Kendall test, Hurst exponents and Wavelet Transform (WT) techniques to investigated the volatilities, trend estimation and persistence of original and WT signals. The key features revealed that the Chl-a pattern is heterogeneous in both time and spatial scale, whereas SST pattern is more homogenous. Trend analysis of the study area showed identifiable and sustainable trend with maximum tendency to decrease of Chl-a, and increase of SST. More than 48% of the study area is under slight decrease, and about 20% area mostly located at the northern parts show slight increase of Chl-a values. The presented methodology is applicable to the data signals that keep the range of inter-annual approximation components of DWT not less than scale level-4.

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamics of selective logging in the state of Mato Grosso between 1992 and 2016
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective logging is a forestry activity that includes harvesting a group of tree species in native forests, usually those of higher value or commercial interest. Selective logging can be carried out legally, in forest management areas and forest areas previously authorized for deforestation, or illegally, in any other unauthorized cases that occur in a predatory manner. In this study, the spatiotemporal dynamic of selectively logged forests in the state of Mato Grosso was assessed based on a time-series (from 1992 to 2016) of logged forests detected using remotely sensed data. Visual interpretation and semi-automatic classification of Landsat imagery were used to detect forests impacted by selective logging activities in the study area. Based on the results, it was estimated that 41,926 km(2) of native forests were selectively logged at least once between 1992 and 2016 in the state of Mato Grosso, an annual average of 1,747 km(2). Selectively logged forests detected showing persistent or recurrent forest disturbances were more frequently observed in the most recent years of this analysis. Most of the selectively logged forests in the study area and period have not been deforested by 2016. It indicates that selective logging is a dissociated phenomenon with deforestation in the state of Mato Grosso. It was also observed that an average of 18 km(2).year(-1) and 268.18 km(2).year(-1) of native forests was selectively logged within Conservation Units and Indigenous Lands between 1992 and 2016. A significant tendency to increase or decrease logging activities within those protected areas in the analyzed period was not observed. Selectively logged forests were persistently detected in the old timber centers located in the central-northern region of the state of Mato Grosso, showing, potentially, new cutting cycles in those previously logged forests. More recently, selective logging activities have reached the last native forest frontier in northwestern Mato Grosso. Finally, it was concluded that selective logging is annually disturbing a considerable extension of native forests in the state of Mato Grosso and, therefore, needs to be adequately considered and monitored by environmental agencies due to its potential forest impacts and to support the definition of public policies to ensure the future sustainability of forest production in that state.

TI  - Spectral response of chlorophyll content during leaf senescence in European beech trees
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf chlorophyll content declines in response to environmental stressors and during natural senescence periods. Assessments of forest health and vulnerability to stressors require repeated measurements of forest health to quantify declines in chlorophyll content and identify shifts in the timing of key phenological events. Although remote sensing is ideal for making reliable and repeated forest health measurements to assess forest response to environmental change over large areas, reliable warning systems for monitoring plant health are lacking. To facilitate the estimation of chlorophyll content from remotely sensed data, we define the relationships between leaf chlorophyll content and spectral indices in European beech trees (Fagus sylvatica). We show that hand-held chlorophyll meters can be calibrated to leaf chlorophyll content providing a non-destructive method for rapid assessment of leaf chlorophyll content in the field. Spectral indices based on the red edge spectral region have the strongest relationship with leaf chlorophyll content (mND705R(2) = 0.95, RMSE = 4.70; mSR705R(2) = 0.95, RMSE = 4.71) but are unable to discriminate between photosynthetically active leaves and inactive leaves. Alternative spectral indices can discriminate effectively between photosynthetically active and inactive leaves but are less well suited to defining declines in chlorophyll content. These findings reveal key research needs for improving the use of remote sensing data for forest health assessments.

TI  - Towards Monitoring of Nutrient Pollution in Coastal Lake Using Remote Sensing and Regression Analysis
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The last few decades have witnessed a tremendous increase in nutrient levels (phosphorus and nitrogen) in coastal water leading to excessive algal growth (Eutrophication). The presence of large amounts of algae turns the water's color into green or red, in the case of algal blooms. Chlorophyll-a is often used as an indicator of algal biomass. Due to increased human activities surrounding Dubai creek, there have been eutrophication concerns given the levels of nutrients in that creek. This study aims to map chlorophyll-a in Dubai Creek from WorldView-2 imagery and explore the relationship between chlorophyll-a and other eutrophication indicators. A geometrically- and atmospherically-corrected WorldView-2 image and in-situ data have been utilized to map chlorophyll-a in the creek. A spectral model, developed from the WorldView-2 multispectral image to monitor Chlorophyll-a concentration, yielded 0.82 R(2)with interpolated in-situ chlorophyll-a data. To address the time lag between the in-situ data and the image, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images were used to demonstrate the accuracy of the WorldView-2 model. The images, acquired on 20 May and 23 July 2012, were processed to extract chlorophyll-a band ratios (Band 4/Band 3) following the standard approach. Based on the availability, the 20 May image acquisition date is the closest to the middle of Quarter 2 (Q2) of the in-situ data (15 May). The 23 July 2012 image acquisition date is the closest to the WorldView-2 image date (24 July). Another model developed to highlight the relationship between spectral chlorophyll-a levels, and total nitrogen and orthophosphate levels, yielded 0.97 R-2, which indicates high agreement. Furthermore, the generated models were found to be useful in mapping chlorophyll-a, total nitrogen, and orthophosphate, without the need for costly in-situ data acquisition efforts.

AB  - The last few weeks of pregnancy are critical to a baby's health because important organs, including the brain and lungs, are not completely developed until the end of pregnancy. The adverse events during labor and childbirth can have very serious physical, psychological and financial consequences for the child, the family, health professionals and the whole community. These events can be reduced through interventions aimed at improving the safety and quality of care, based on evidence-based knowledge, guidelines and practices that must be widely and effectively applied. This work reports the experience of the Lombardy Region on improvement actions in the obstetric and gynecological procedures for the reduction of adverse events and sentinel events through the monitoring and management of the RCGS trigger tool.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of machine learning on remote sensing data appear to be endless. Its use in damage identification for early response in the aftermath of a large-scale disaster has a specific issue. The collection of training data right after a disaster is costly, time-consuming, and many times impossible. This study analyzes a possible solution to the referred issue: the collection of training data from past disaster events to calibrate a discriminant function. Then the identification of affected areas in a current disaster can be performed in near real-time. The performance of a supervised machine learning classifier to learn from training data collected from the 2018 heavy rainfall at Okayama Prefecture, Japan, and to identify floods due to the typhoon Hagibis on 12 October 2019 at eastern Japan is reported in this paper. The results show a moderate agreement with flood maps provided by local governments and public institutions, and support the assumption that previous disaster information can be used to identify a current disaster in near-real time.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing of Forest Degradation using NDFI and the BFAST Algorithm
T2  - IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, results related with the assessment of the capabilityto detect forest degradation by analyzing NDFI time series through the BFAST algorithm are presented. Recent studies have shown the potential of the BFAST algorithm applied to a time-series of satellite-derived spectral indices such as NDVI or EVI to detect unambiguous and subtle perturbations of the forest cover canopy both positive (e.g. regeneration) and negative (e.g. deforestation). Similarly, these results suggest the feasibility to distinguish between several types of forest degradation and their causal agents such as selective logging and forest fire. In this context, the results derived from this research show that using NDFI as a data source in the BFAST algorithm improves the detection of forest degradation, and additionally provides information to understand both temporal and spatial approaches related with the dynamics of perturbations of the forest canopy

TI  - Tracking Rates of Forest Disturbance and Associated Carbon Loss in Areas of Illegal Amber Mining in Ukraine Using Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping forest disturbance is crucial for many applications related to decision-making for sustainable forest management. This study identified the effect of illegal amber mining on forest change and accumulated carbon stock across a study area of 8125.5 ha in northern Ukraine. Our method relies on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) implementation of the Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr) temporal segmentation algorithm of Landsat time-series (LTS) to derive yearly maps of forest disturbance and recovery in areas affected by amber extraction operations. We used virtual reality (VR) 360 interactive panoramic images taken from the sites to attribute four levels of forest disturbance associated with the delta normalized burn ratio (dNBR) and then calculated the carbon loss. We revealed that illegal amber extraction in Ukraine has been occurring since the middle of the 1990s, yielding 3260 ha of total disturbed area up to 2019. This study indicated that the area of forest disturbance increased dramatically during 2013-2014, and illegal amber operations persist. As a result, regrowth processes were mapped on only 375 ha of total disturbed area. The results were integrated into the Forest Stewardship Council(R)(FSC(R)) quality management system in the region to categorize Forest Management Units (FMUs) conforming to different disturbance rates and taking actions related to their certification status. Moreover, carbon loss evaluation allows the responsible forest management systems to be streamlined and to endorse ecosystem service assessment.

TI  - Use of local and global maps of forest canopy height and aboveground biomass to enhance local estimates of biomass in miombo woodlands in Tanzania
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Field surveys are often a primary source of aboveground biomass (AGB) data, but plot-based estimates of parameters related to AGB are often not sufficiently precise, particularly not in tropical countries. Remotely sensed data may complement field data and thus help to increase the precision of estimates and circumvent some of the problems with missing sample observations in inaccessible areas. Here, we report the results of a study conducted in a 15,867 km(2) area in the dry miombo woodlands of Tanzania, to quantify the contribution of existing canopy height and biomass maps to improving the precision of canopy height and AGB estimates locally. A local and a global height map and three global biomass maps, and a probability sample of 513 inventory plots were subject to analysis. Model-assisted sampling estimators were used to estimate mean height and AGB across the study area using the original maps and then with the maps calibrated with local inventory plots. Large systematic map errors - positive or negative - were found for all the maps, with systematic errors as great as 60-70 %. The maps contributed nothing or even negatively to the precision of mean height and mean AGB estimates. However, after being calibrated locally, the maps contributed substantially to increasing the precision of both mean height and mean AGB estimates, with relative efficiencies (variance of the field-based estimates relative to the variance of the map-assisted estimates) of 1.3-2.7 for the overall estimates. The study, although focused on a relatively small area of dry tropical forests, illustrates the potential strengths and weaknesses of existing global forest height and biomass maps based on remotely sensed data and universal prediction models. Our results suggest that the use of regional or local inventory data for calibration can substantially increase the precision of map-based estimates and their applications in assessing forest carbon stocks for emission reduction programs and policy and financial decisions.

TI  - Extreme Events of Precipitation over Complex Terrain Derived from Satellite Data for Climate Applications: An Evaluation of the Southern Slopes of the Pyrenees
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating extreme precipitation events over complex terrain is challenging but crucial for evaluating the performance of climate models for the present climate and expected changes of the climate in the future. New satellites operating in the microwave wavelengths have started to open new opportunities for performing such estimation at adequate temporal and spatial scales and within sensible error limits. This paper illustrates the feasibility and limits of estimating precipitation extremes from satellite data for climatological applications. Using a high-resolution gauge database as ground truth, it was found that global precipitation measurement (GPM) constellation data can provide valuable estimates of extreme precipitation over the southern slopes of the Pyrenees, a region comprising several climates and a very diverse terrain (a challenge for satellite precipitation algorithms). Validation using an object-based quality measure showed reasonable performance, suggesting that GPM estimates can be advantageous reference data for climate model evaluation.

TI  - Satellite-derived changes in floodplain productivity and freshwater habitats in northern Australia (1991-2019)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological communities supported by freshwater habitats and wetlands that persist from floodplain inundation generate numerous cultural, recreational and economic values via commercial fisheries and other human uses of these habitats. However, the alteration of flow connectivity, degradation, and disruption of physical processes that sustain different levels of organisms (e.g., primary producers) are threats that affect aquatic biodiversity and the productivity of these habitats. Therefore, the large scale assessment of freshwater habitats for proactive water resources planning and the development of climate change mitigation and resource management strategies is essential. However, such monitoring and assessment is complicated by the inaccessibility of many large wetland systems during times of inundation, making in situ sampling unfeasible at a time when high levels of aquatic primary producers are generating food and energy sources for higher order consumers. To understand the physical dynamics of aquatic primary producers and freshwater habitats (1991-2019) during such times in a large floodplain river in northern Australia (Gilbert catchment), this study integrated Landsat-derived modified normalised difference water index and normalised difference vegetation index in a classification tree model. Thereafter, key hydrological drivers (rainfall and river discharge) of floodplain productivity and connectivity were assessed using a range of multivariate techniques. Results show that the floodplain had a high aquatic plant biomass during the summer wet season based on the correlation between aquatic biomass accumulation (hot spots) and inundation (r = 0.83 @ phase lag < 1 month) during such period. River discharge (r = 0.68 @ lag = 1 month) at downstream Gilbert catchment appear to be a relatively stronger indicator of hot spots of floodplain biomass accumulation as opposed to local rainfall (r = 0.57 @ lag = 3 months). While the downstream discharge explains a significant proportion of variability in the leading orthogonal mode of rainfall (r = 0.83), statistical relationships developed between discharge/rainfall and the distribution of aquatic primary producers confirm that both rivers (flow) and local rainfall are key optimal predictors of inundation and sites of primary producers with river flows being a better indicator of the latter. It is therefore argued that hydro-meteorological fluctuations will be key constraints on freshwater habitats and the growth of primary producers, albeit, human disturbance of flow can impact on floodplain productivity. As illustrated in this study, such constraints are reflected in the spatial patterns and changing characteristics (connectivity and spatial heterogeneity) of hot spots of primary producers and freshwater habitats (Palustrine, Lacustrine, and Riverine ecosystems).

TI  - The irruption of the extraordinary in <i>Theorem</i>: between literature and cinema
T2  - ITINERARIOS-REVISTA DE LITERATURA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses Theorem's two versions, movie and novel, both from Pier Paolo Pasolini (1922-1975). These narratives tell the story of the coming of a mysterious guest to a bourgeois family's bosom and the consequences of this fact. The socializing with the young guest, whose nature is divine, triggers a chain reaction in the family members. The analysis approach is guided by Algirdas Julien Greimas' De l'Imperfection (2002), which explores the theme of the extraordinary and the aesthetic irruption in artistic simulacrums as well as in the "real life" of "real historical" subjects. Although Greimas favors the transcendental aesthetical aspect of these extraordinary events, this paper's objective is to prove that, in both versions of Theorem, there is a multiple experience, because it congregates many aesthetical, sacred, and metaphysical aspects, thus, creating a re-signifying of the subjects' experiences that modify their worldview.

TI  - The potential for REDD plus to reduce forest degradation in Vietnam
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural forests in Vietnam have experienced rapid declines in the last 70 years, as a result of degradation from logging and conversion of natural forests to timber and rubber plantations. Degradation of natural forests leads to loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, impacting the livelihoods of surrounding communities. Efforts to address ongoing loss of natural forests, through mechanisms such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+), require an understanding of the links between forest degradation and the livelihoods of local communities, which have rarely been studied in Vietnam. We combined information from livelihood surveys, remote sensing and forest inventories around a protected natural forest area in North Central Vietnam. For forest-adjacent communities, we found natural forests contributed an average of 28% of total household income with plantation forests contributing an additional 15%. Although officially prohibited, logging contributed more than half of the total income derived from natural forests. Analysis of Landsat images over the period 1990 to 2014 combined with forest inventory data, demonstrates selective logging was leading to ongoing degradation of natural forests resulting in loss of 3.3 +/- 0.8 Mg biomass ha(-1)yr(-1)across the protected area. This is equivalent to 1.5% yr(-1)of total forest biomass, with rates as high as 3% yr(-1)in degraded and easily accessible parts of the protected area. We estimate that preventing illegal logging would incur local opportunity costs of USD $4.10 +/- 0.90 per Mg CO2, similar to previous estimates for tropical forest protected areas and substantially less than the opportunity costs in timber or agricultural concessions. Our analysis suggests activities to reduce forest degradation in protected areas are likely to be financially viable through Vietnam's REDD+ program.

TI  - Multi-Decadal Changes in Mangrove Extent, Age and Species in the Red River Estuaries of Viet Nam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research investigated the performance of four different machine learning supervised image classifiers: artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) using SPOT-7 and Sentinel-1 images to classify mangrove age and species in 2019 in a Red River estuary, typical of others found in northern Viet Nam. The four classifiers were chosen because they are considered to have high accuracy, however, their use in mangrove age and species classifications has thus far been limited. A time-series of Landsat images from 1975 to 2019 was used to map mangrove extent changes using the unsupervised classification method of iterative self-organizing data analysis technique (ISODATA) and a comparison with accuracy of K-means classification, which found that mangrove extent has increased, despite a fall in the 1980s, indicating the success of mangrove plantation and forest protection efforts by local people in the study area. To evaluate the supervised image classifiers, 183 in situ training plots were assessed, 70% of them were used to train the supervised algorithms, with 30% of them employed to validate the results. In order to improve mangrove species separations, Gram-Schmidt and principal component analysis image fusion techniques were applied to generate better quality images. All supervised and unsupervised (2019) results of mangrove age, species, and extent were mapped and accuracy was evaluated. Confusion matrices were calculated showing that the classified layers agreed with the ground-truth data where most producer and user accuracies were greater than 80%. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients (around 0.9) indicated that the image classifications were very good. The test showed that SVM was the most accurate, followed by DT, ANN, and RF in this case study. The changes in mangrove extent identified in this study and the methods tested for using remotely sensed data will be valuable to monitoring and evaluation assessments of mangrove plantation projects.

TI  - Air Pollution Scenario over China during COVID-19
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedented slowdown in China during the COVID-19 period of November 2019 to April 2020 should have reduced pollution in smog-laden cities. However, moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) show a marked increase in aerosols over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BHT) region and most of Northeast and Central China, compared with the previous winter. Fine particulate (PM2.5) data from ground monitoring stations show an increase of 19.5% in Beijing during January and February 2020, and no reduction for Tianjin. In March and April 2020, a different spatial pattern emerges, with very high AOD levels observed over 50% of the Chinese mainland, and including peripheral regions in the northwest and southwest. At the same time, ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) satellite-derived NO2 concentrations fell drastically across China. The increase in PM2.5 while NO2 decreased in BTH and across China is likely due to enhanced production of secondary particulates. These are formed when reductions in NOx result in increased ozone formation, thus increasing the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. Support for this explanation is provided by ground level air quality data showing increased volume of fine mode aerosols throughout February and March 2020, and increased levels of PM2.5, relative humidity (RH), and ozone during haze episodes in the COVID-19 lockdown period. Backward trajectories show the origin of air masses affecting industrial centers of North and East China to be local. Other contributors to increased atmospheric particulates may include inflated industrial production in peripheral regions to compensate loss in the main population and industrial centers, and low wind speeds. Satellite monitoring of the extraordinary atmospheric conditions resulting from the COVID-19 shutdown could enhance understanding of smog formation and attempts to control it.

TI  - Synergy of High-Resolution Radar and Optical Images Satellite for Identification and Mapping of Wetland Macrophytes on the Danube Delta
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In wetland environments, vegetation has an important role in ecological functioning. The main goal of this work is to identify an optimal combination of Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), and Pleiades data using ground-reference data to accurately map wetland macrophytes in the Danube Delta. We tested several combinations of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data rigorously at two levels. First, in order to reduce the confusion between reed (Phragmites australis(Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.) and other macrophyte communities, a time series analysis of S1 data was performed. The potential of S1 for detection of compact reed on plaur, compact reed on plaur/reed cut, open reed on plaur, pure reed, and reed on salinized soil was evaluated through time series of backscatter coefficient and coherence ratio images, calculated mainly according to the phenology of the reed. The analysis of backscattering coefficients allowed separation of reed classes that strongly overlapped. The coherence coefficient showed that C-band SAR repeat pass interferometric coherence for cut reed detection is feasible. In the second section, random forest (RF) classification was applied to the S2, Pleiades, and S1 data and in situ observations to discriminate and map reed against other aquatic macrophytes (submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), emergent macrophytes, some floating broad-leaved and floating vegetation of delta lakes). In addition, different optical indices were included in the RF. A total of 67 classification models were made in several sensor combinations with two series of validation samples (with the reed and without reed) using both a simple and more detailed classification schema. The results showed that reed is completely discriminable compared to other macrophytes communities with all sensor combinations. In all combinations, the model-based producer's accuracy (PA) and user's accuracy (UA) for reed with both nomenclatures were over 90%. The diverse combinations of sensors were valuable for improving the overall classification accuracy of all of the communities of aquatic macrophytes exceptMyriophyllum spicatumL.

TI  - Soil Conservation Service Spatiotemporal Variability and Its Driving Mechanism on the Guizhou Plateau, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Guizhou Plateau has an extremely fragile ecological environment with prominent soil and water losses. Since 2000, conservation policies and ecological restoration projects, e.g., the Grain for Green Project (GGP), have been implemented on the Guizhou Plateau to control soil/water losses which have achieved notable accomplishments. Using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to estimate the soil conservation service (SCS) on the Guizhou Plateau, this study analyzed the dynamic characteristics of its spatiotemporal variation based on multiyear (2000-2018) meteorological and remote sensing data to determine its driving mechanisms. Residual analysis of the meteorological and remote sensing data was used to evaluate the effect of anthropogenic activities. Results showed a clear upward trend (1.39 t ha(-1)yr(-1)) of SCS on the Guizhou Plateau during 2000-2018, and areas with a highly improved positive effect on SCS were distributed primarily in karst landform regions. Precipitation and vegetation fractional coverage (VFC) were found to be positively correlated with SCS on the Guizhou Plateau. Specifically, the highest proportion of significant positive correlation between precipitation and SCS was related to the Wildlife Conservation Nature Reserve (WCNR), and the highest proportion of significant positive correlation between VFC and SCS was related to the GGP, i.e., 76.59% and 53.02%, respectively. Residual analysis revealed a significant positive role of anthropogenic activity on SCS improvement via ecological engineering in areas with a poor ecological background, e.g., the GGP in western areas where the ecological environment is fragile and the problem of water/soil loss is serious. In areas with a more robust ecological background, e.g., the engineering area of the WCNR, the effect of anthropogenic activity has had a largely negative effect on SCS. The findings of this study could make an important contribution to the development of ecological management projects and the work to control soil/water losses on the Guizhou Plateau.

TI  - Global Forecast Impact of Low Data Latency Infrared and Microwave Sounders Observations from Polar Orbiting Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Direct Broadcast Network (DBNet) provides near-real-time delivery of low-earth-orbiting (LEO) meteorological satellites to operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems that need short data cut-off times to allow for the assimilation of the most recent satellite measurements. The NWP model requires timely delivery of observations including atmospheric temperature, humidity, and surface wind vectors. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Space Program (WSP) recommends the data latency of no more than 20 min for the satellite measurements. Currently, not all DBNet stations are delivering satellite data within the 20-min time frame. In this study, the forecast impact of the observations of LEO satellite sounders with data latency of 20 min or less was evaluated using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS). Reducing the data latency up to 5 min increases the number of LEO infrared (IR) and microwave (MW) sounder observations delivered to the NCEP GFS data assimilation system by more than 20%. Overall, this study demonstrates a positive impact on the global weather forecasts when the IR and MW sounder data are delivered by 20 min anywhere in the world. Additional forecast benefits are not obvious for shorter data latency. Results from this study support the WSP recommendation of 20-minute data latency.

TI  - An Adaptive and Extensible System for Satellite-Based, Large Scale Burnt Area Monitoring in Near-Real Time
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the case of ongoing wildfire events, timely information on current fire parameters is crucial for informed decision making. Satellite imagery can provide valuable information in this regard, since thermal sensors can detect the exact location and intensity of an active fire at the moment the satellite passes over. This information can be derived and distributed in near-real time, allowing for a picture of current fire activity. However, the derivation of the size and shape of an already affected area is more complex and therefore most often not available within a short time frame. For urgent decision making though, it would be desirable to have this information available in near-real time, and on a large scale. The approach presented here works fully automatic and provides perimeters of burnt areas within two hours after the satellite scene acquisition. It uses the red and near-infrared bands of mid-resolution imagery to facilitate continental-scale monitoring of recently occurred burnt areas. To allow for a high detection capacity independent of the affected vegetation type, segmentation thresholds are derived dynamically from contextual information. This is done by using a Morphological Active Contour approach for perimeter determination. The results are validated against semi-automatically derived burnt areas for five wildfire incidents in Europe. Furthermore, these results are compared with three widely used burnt area datasets on a country-wide scale. It is shown that a high detection quality can be reached in near real-time. The large-scale inter-comparison shows that the results coincide with 63% to 76% of the burnt area in the reference datasets. While these established datasets are only available with a time lag of several months or are created by using manual interaction, the presented approach produces results in near-real time fully automatically. This work is therefore supposed to represent a valuable improvement in wildfire related rapid damage assessment.

TI  - Analysis on the Characteristics of Spatial and Temporal Changes for Land Desertification in Hotan Area
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal and spatial evolution process of land desertification in Hotan area of Xinjiang was studied with the aim of land desertification control and ecological environment restoration in arid area. Using MODIS 13Q1-NDVI remote sensing data of Hotan area based on RS and GIS technology and taking vegetation coverage as the evaluation index of desertification at different levels, the characteristics in spatial and temporal changes of land desertification in Hotan area from 2000 to 2018 were analyzed. The results show that : (1) the areas with decreasing trend for vegetation coverage accounted for 0.38% of the total study area, of which the area with extremely significant reduction with vegetation coverage accounted for 0.10% of the total area ; and the area with significant reduction with vegetation coverage accounted for 0.28% of the total area ; the area with increasing vegetation coverage accounted for 12.88% of the total area, of which the area with extremely significant growth with vegetation coverage accounted for only 1.10%, and the area with significant growth with vegetation coverage was accounted for 11.78% of the total study area. (2) The area of severe desertification showed a decreasing trend from 2006 to 2012 and then an increasin g trend from 2012 to 2018, with an average annual increasing rate of 0.59%, while the area of moderate desertification showed a decreasing trend with an average annual decreasing rate of 1.43%, while the area of mild desertification and non-desertification maintained an increasing trend with an average annual increasing rate of 2.19% and 3.70%, respectively. (3) According to the area transfer matrix, in the past 20 years, the area of unchanged land types in the study area is 19.841x10(4) km(2), the least transfer area was non-desertification area, and the transfer area of moderate desertification area was relatively larger. Due to the influence of air temperature, precipitation and human activities and other factors, the area of severe desertification in Hotan area has increased slightly in recent 20 years, while the areas of slight desertification and non-desertification have been increased significantly.

TI  - Rapid Mangrove Forest Loss and Nipa Palm (<i>Nypa fruticans</i>) Expansion in the Niger Delta, 2007-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests in the Niger Delta are very valuable, providing ecosystem services, such as carbon storage, fish nurseries, coastal protection, and aesthetic values. However, they are under threat from urbanization, logging, oil pollution, and the proliferation of the invasive Nipa Palm (Nypa fruticans). However, there are no reliable data on the current extent of mangrove forest in the Niger Delta, its rate of loss, or the rate of colonization by the invasive Nipa Palm. Here, we estimate the area of Nipa Palm and mangrove forests in the Niger Delta in 2007 and 2017, using 567 ground control points, Advanced Land Observatory Satellite Phased Array L-band SAR (ALOS PALSAR), Landsat and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model 2000 (SRTM DEM). We performed the classification using Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods. The classification results showed SVM (overall accuracy 93%) performed better than ML (77%). Producers (PA) and User's accuracy (UA) for the best SVM classification were above 80% for most classes; however, these were considerably lower for Nipa Palm (PA-32%, UA-30%). We estimated a 2017 mangrove area of 801,774 +/- 34,787 ha (+/- 95% Confidence Interval) ha and Nipa Palm extent of 11,447 +/- 7343 ha. Our maps show a greater landward extent than other reported products. The results indicate a 12% (7-17%) decrease in mangrove area and 694 (0-1304)% increase in Nipa Palm. Mapping efforts should continue for policy targeting and monitoring. The mangroves of the Niger Delta are clearly in grave danger from both rapid clearance and encroachment by the invasive Nipa Palm. This is of great concern given the dense carbon stocks and the value of these mangroves to local communities for generating fish stocks and protection from extreme events.

TI  - Snowmelt velocity predicts vegetation green-wave velocity in mountainous ecological systems of North America
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The timing of spring initiates an important period for resource availability for large trophic webs within ecosystems, including forage for grazing animals, flowers for pollinators, and the higher trophic levels that depend on these resources. Spring timing is highly variable across space, being influenced strongly by the departure of snow cover (i.e. snowmelt timing, in locations with a seasonal snowpack), climate, weather, elevation, and latitude. When spring timing occurs along a gradient (e.g. spring arriving later in higher elevations of mountainous terrain), the organisms that rely on spring resources often migrate to maintain an optimal position for spring resources - a phenomenon known as 'surfing the green wave.' While this behavior has been observed by tracking animals, there have been no studies to quantify the green wave as a movement across space and time. Furthermore, considering that snowmelt timing has moderate power to explain green-up timing for a given location, we ask the question: does snowmelt velocity predict green wave velocity? Here, we introduce the first continental maps of snowmelt and green wave velocity for North America from 2001 to 2016 as derived from the MODIS MCD12Q2 phenology dataset. We show that both snowmelt and green wave velocities are influenced strongly by topography, including slope and aspect. Furthermore, we quantify the relationships between snowmelt and green wave velocities according to three variables: direction, speed, and distance traveled. We conclude that mountainous ecoregions, such as the western North American cordillera, have the highest correspondence between snowmelt and green wave velocities, compared to flatter regions such as the Great Plains and tundra. This work will be of interest to wildlife ecologists, biologists, and land managers who seek to conserve migratory animals and the ecosystems that support them.

TI  - Safety evaluation of abdominal trachelectomy in patients with cervical tumors ≥2 cm: a single-institution, retrospective analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: For oncologic safety, vaginal radical trachelectomy is generally performed only in patients with cervical cancers smaller than 2 cm. However, because inclusion criteria for abdominal trachelectomy are controversial, we evaluated the safety of abdominal trachelectomy for cervical cancers >= 2 cm.Methods: We began performing abdominal trachelectomies at our institution in 2005, primarily for squamous cell carcinoma <= 3 cm or adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma <= 2 cm. If a positive sentinel lymph node or cervical margin was diagnosed intraoperatively by frozen section, the trachelectomy was converted to a hysterectomy. Medical records of these patients were reviewed retrospectively. Patients who had undergone simple abdominal trachelectomy were excluded from this study.Results: We attempted trachelectomy in 212 patients. Among the 135 patients with tumors <2 cm, trachelectomy was successful in 120, one of whom developed recurrence and none of whom died of their disease. Among 77 patients with tumors >= 2 cm, trachelectomy was successful in 62, 2 of whom developed recurrence and 1 of whom died of her disease. The overall relapse rate after trachelectomy was 1.6% (0.8% in <2 cm group and 3.2% in >= 2 cm group), and the mortality rate was 0.5% (0% in <2 cm group and 1.6% in >= 2 cm group). Recurrence-free survival (p=0.303) and overall survival (p=0.193) did not differ significantly between the <2 cm and >= 2 cm groups.Conclusions: Abdominal trachelectomy with intraoperative frozen sections of sentinel lymph nodes and cervical margins is oncologically safe, even in patients with tumors >= 2 cm.

TI  - Regional measurements and spatial/temporal analysis of CDOM in 10,000+optically variable Minnesota lakes using Landsat 8 imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is essential for understanding and managing lakes but is often not available, especially in lake-rich regions where concentrations are often highly variable in time and space. We developed remote sensing methods that can use both Landsat and Sentinel satellite imagery to provide census-level CDOM measurements across the state of Minnesota, USA, a lake-rich landscape with highly varied lake, watershed, and climatic conditions. We evaluated the error of satellite derived CDOM resulting from two atmospheric correction methods with in situ data, and found that both provided substantial improvements over previous methods. We applied CDOM models to 2015 and 2016 Landsat 8 OLI imagery to create 2015 and 2016 Minnesota statewide CDOM maps (reported as absorption coefficients at 440 nm, a(440)) and used those maps to conduct a geospatial analysis at the ecoregion level. Large differences in a(440) among ecoregions were related to predominant land cover/use; lakes in ecoregions with large areas of wetland and forest had significantly higher CDOM levels than lakes in agricultural ecoregions. We compared regional lake CDOM levels between two years with strongly contrasting precipitation (close-to-normal precipitation year in 2015 and much wetter conditions with large storm events in 2016). CDOM levels of lakes in agricultural ecoregions tended to decrease between 2015 and 2016, probably because of dilution by rainfall, and 7% of lakes in these areas decreased in a(440) by >= 3 m(-1). In two ecoregions with high forest and wetlands cover, a(440) increased by >3 m(-1) in 28 and 31% of the lakes, probably due to enhanced transport of CDOM from forested wetlands. With appropriate model tuning and validation, the approach we describe could be extended to other regions, providing a method for frequent and comprehensive measurements of CDOM, a dynamic and important variable in surface waters.<bold> </bold>

TI  - Sugar Feeding Patterns for <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) Mosquitoes in South Texas
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective mosquito surveillance and management depend on a thorough understanding of the biology and feeding patterns unique to species and sex. Given that a propensity to sugar feed is necessary for some mosquito surveillance and newer control strategies, we sought to document the amount of total sugar in wild Aedes aegypti (L.) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) captured from five different locations in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of South Texas over 2 yr. We used Biogents Sentinel 2 (BW2) traps in year 1 and aspirators, BGS2, and CDC resting traps in years 2 and 3 to collect adult mosquitoes.The hot anthrone test was used to quantify total sugar content in each mosquito. Additionally, the cold and hot anthrone tests were used to distinguish fructose content from total sugars for mosquitoes captured in 2019. Overall, Ae. aegypti females had significantly lower total sugar content than Ae. aegypti males as well as both sexes of Cx. quinquefasciatus. However, the percentage of Ae. aegypti positive for fructose consumption was four to eightfold higher than Ae. aegypti previously reported in other regions. The difference between locations was significant for males of both species, but not for females. Seasonality and trapping method also revealed significant differences in sugar content of captured mosquitoes. Our results reinforce that sugar feeding in female Ae. aegypti is less than Cx. quinquefasciatus, although not absent.This study provides necessary data to evaluate the potential effectiveness of sugar baits in surveillance and control of both Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes.

TI  - Evaluation of Methods for Causal Discovery in Hydrometeorological Systems
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding causal relations is of utmost importance in hydrology and climate research for systems identification, prediction, and understanding systems behavior in a changing climate. Traditionally, researchers in hydrometeorology attempted to study causal questions by conducting controlled experiments using numerical models. This approach, however, in most cases of interest provides uncertain results because the models are approximate representation of the natural system. An alternative approach that has recently drawn significant attention in several fields is to infer causal relations from purely observational data. It possesses several traits to its utility particularly in hydrometeorology due to the rapid accumulation of in situ and remotely sensed data records. The first objective of this study is to present a brief description of four causal discovery methods (Granger causality, Transfer Entropy, graph-based algorithms, and Convergent Cross Mapping) with special emphasis on the assumptions on which they are built. Second, using synthetic data generated from a hydrological model, we assess their performance in retrieving causal information taking into account sensitivity to sample size and presence of noise. Last, we use causal analysis to examine and formulate hypotheses on causal drivers of evapotranspiration in a shrubland region during summer and winter seasons. An interpretation of the hypotheses based on canopy seasonal dynamics and evapotranspiration processes is presented. It is hoped that the results presented here can be useful in guiding researchers studying hydrometeorological systems as to which causal method is most appropriate to the characteristics of the system under study.

TI  - Spaceborne L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar Data for Geoscientific Analyses in Coastal Land Applications: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The coastal zone offers among the world's most productive and valuable ecosystems and is experiencing increasing pressure from anthropogenic impacts: human settlements, agriculture, aquaculture, trade, industrial activities, oil and gas exploitation and tourism. Earth observation has great capability to deliver valuable data at the local, regional and global scales and can support the assessment and monitoring of land- and water-related applications in coastal zones. Compared to optical satellites, cloud-cover does not limit the timeliness of data acquisition with spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors, which have all-weather, day and night capabilities. Hence, active radar systems demonstrate great potential for continuous mapping and monitoring of coastal regions, particularly in cloud-prone tropical and sub-tropical climates. The canopy penetration capability with long radar wavelength enables L-band SAR data to be used for coastal terrestrial environments and has been widely applied and investigated for the following geoscientific topics: mapping and monitoring of flooded vegetation and inundated areas; the retrieval of aboveground biomass; and the estimation of soil moisture. Human activities, global population growth, urban sprawl and climate change-induced impacts are leading to increased pressure on coastal ecosystems causing land degradation, deforestation and land use change. This review presents a comprehensive overview of existing research articles that apply spaceborne L-band SAR data for geoscientific analyses that are relevant for coastal land applications.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction Thresholds for Ground-Based Radar Interferometry Deformation Monitoring Estimated Using Time Series Analyses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based radar interferometry (GBSAR) is a useful method to control the stability of engineering objects and elements of geographical spaces at risk of deformation or displacement. To secure accurate and credible measurement results, it is crucial to consider atmospheric conditions as they influence the corrections to distance measurements. These conditions are especially important considering the radar bandwidth used. Measurements for the stability of engineering objects are not always performed in locations where meteorological monitoring is prevalent; however, information about the range of variability in atmospheric corrections is always welcome. The authors present a hybrid method to estimate the probable need of atmospheric corrections, which allows partly eliminating false positive alarms of deformations as caused by atmospheric fluctuations. Unlike the numerous publications on atmospheric reductions focused on the current state of the atmosphere, the proposed solution is based on applying a classic machine learning algorithm designed for the SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with covariate at time) time series data model for satellite data shared by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) during the Landsat MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) mission before performing residual estimation during the monitoring phase. Example calculations (proof of concept) were made for ten-year satellite data covering a region for experimental flood bank stability observations as performed using the IBIS-L (Image by Interferometric Survey-Landslide) radar and for target monitoring data (ground measurements).

TI  - ImaACor: A Physically Based Tool for Combined Atmospheric and Topographic Corrections of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - ImaACor is a tool for the simultaneous correction of remotely sensed data from atmospheric and topographic effects, including second-order corrections, such as adjacency effects. The implemented approach is physically based and uses MODTRAN for computation of the main radiometric quantities. A user-friendly, comprehensive, and exhaustive graphic interface allows the user to choose from different correction levels. The various panels allow one to set all the parameters to correctly characterize the atmosphere and define the acquisition and illumination geometries. The tool provides a number of facilities to easily manage the correction process for a wide range of sensor data, including the ability to process multiple data in batch mode, which is very useful for dealing with temporal series. Under the inclusion of topographic correction, this tool allows the user to select a digital elevation model that is automatically resampled to the image resolution and processed to obtain the parameters for radiometric transfer modeling and the subsequent harmonization of the surface with the model inversion. This tool also includes utilities for the pre-processing of PRISMA data.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability of Aerosol Optical Depth, Total Ozone and NO<sub>2</sub>Over East Asia: Strategy for the Validation to the GEMS Scientific Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the spatio-temporal variability of aerosol optical depth (AOD), total column ozone (TCO), and total column NO2(TCN) was identified over East Asia using long-term datasets from ground-based and satellite observations. Based on the statistical results, optimized spatio-temporal ranges for the validation study were determined with respect to the target materials. To determine both spatial and temporal ranges for the validation study, we confirmed that the observed datasets can be statistically considered as the same quantity within the ranges. Based on the thresholds of R-2>0.95 (temporal) and R>0.95 (spatial), the basic ranges for spatial and temporal scales for AOD validation was within 30 km and 30 min, respectively. Furthermore, the spatial scales for AOD validation showed seasonal variation, which expanded the range to 40 km in summer and autumn. Because of the seasonal change of latitudinal gradient of the TCO, the seasonal variation of the north-south range is a considerable point. For the TCO validation, the north-south range is varied from 0.87 degrees in spring to 1.05 degrees in summer. The spatio-temporal range for TCN validation was 20 min (temporal) and 20-50 km (spatial). However, the nearest value of satellite data was used in the validation because the spatio-temporal variation of TCN is large in summer and autumn. Estimation of the spatio-temporal variability for respective pollutants may contribute to improving the validation of satellite products.

TI  - Chemical Composition and Light Absorption of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Observed at Two Sites near a Busy Road during Summer and Winter
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - To examine the difference in the major chemical composition of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) between two roadway sites, 24 h integrated PM(2.5)samples were simultaneously collected both 15 m (Buk-Ku District Office (BKO) site) and 150 m (Chonnam National University campus (CNU) site) away from busy roads during the summer and winter periods; these samples were taken to determine the concentrations of organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and water-soluble inorganic species. In addition, the real-time aerosol light absorption coefficients (Abs) were measured using a dual-spot seven-wavelength aethalometer at the CNU site to evaluate the influence of traffic and biomass burning (BB) emissions on the concentrations of organic aerosol particles. The hourly NO(2)concentration was also observed at an air pollution monitoring network that is about 2 km away from the CNU site. During summer, 24 h PM(2.5)concentrations (PM(2.5)episode) which exceeded the Korean PM(2.5)standard (35 mu g/m(3)) were linked to increases in organic matter (OM) and SO(4)(2-)concentrations that accounted for on average 35-41% and 26-30%, respectively, of the PM(2.5)at the two sites. The increased SO(4)(2-)concentration was most likely attributable to the inflow of long-range transported aerosols, rather than local production, as demonstrated by both the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images and transport pathways of air masses reaching the sites. On the other hand, the OM, WSOC, and EC concentrations were directly attributable to traffic emissions at the sampling sites, as supported by the tight correlation between the OC and EC. A small difference between the absorption angstrom ngstrom exponent (AAE) values calculated at wavelengths of 370-950 nm (AAE(370-950nm)) and 370-520 nm (AAE(370-520nm)), and the poor correlation of absorption coefficient by brown carbon (BrC) at 370 nm (Abs(BrC370nm)) with K+(R-2= 0.00) also suggest a significant contribution of traffic emissions to OM. However, the wintertime PM(2.5)episode was strongly related to the enhanced OM and NO(3)(-)concentrations, which contributed 26-28% and 22-23% of the PM(2.5)concentration, respectively. It is interesting to note that there were two distinct OC/EC ratios in winter: a lower OC/EC (similar to 3.0), which indicates a significant contribution of traffic emissions to the OC and EC, and a higher OC/EC (similar to 6.5), which suggests an additional influence of BB emissions as well as traffic emissions at the sites. Strong correlations between the OC and EC (R-2= 0.72-0.83) and the enhanced AAE(370-520nm)values compared to the AAE(370-950nm)support that BB emissions were also an important contributor to the wintertime OM concentrations as well as traffic emissions at the two sites. A good correlation between the gaseous NO(2)and NO(3)(-)and meteorological conditions (e.g., low wind speed and high relative humidity) suggest that the heterogeneous oxidation of NO(2)on moist particles could be an important contributor to wintertime particulate NO(3)(-)formation at the sites.The OC concentrations during summer and winter were higher at the BKO site, with a higher traffic flow and a shorter distance from the roadway than at the CNU site. However, there were slight differences in the concentrations of secondary inorganic species (NO3-, SO42-, and NH4+) between the sites during summer and winter.

TI  - Analysis of growing areas and bodies of water by calculating radiometric indices with Sentinel-2 images
T2  - REVISTA DIGITAL LAMPSAKOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crops and bodies of water are a topic of interest to countries. Having information about growing areas, water sources and their behaviour in the different seasons of the year is useful for agricultural production and decision-making. On the other hand. a large amount of Earth satellite data and tools for the processing of large Volumes of satellite images have now been generated that are critical for forest monitoring, multiteinporal analysis of growing areas and bodies of water, classification of land use, among others. Sentinel-2 is an Earth observation program consisting of 13 spectral bands that provide high spatial resolution and radiometric quality images. This article presents a multitemporal analysis based on the Standardized Difference Vegetation Index and Standardized Difference Water Index obtained with images of the Sentinel-2 satellite, for the identification of changes that occur in an area of south-eastern Mexico in the period 2018-2020. The results obtained demonstrate a low range of radiometric indexes in the study areas during 2018. In addition, the biggest changes during the rainy season were recorded in 2018; this shows the provocation in the decrease in crop quality and in the body of water.

TI  - Effects of environmental conditions on the use offorward-lookinginfrared for bear den detection in the Alaska Arctic
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial off-road activity in winter overlaps denning habitat of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) in the North Slope oilfields of Alaska (United States). To prevent disturbance of dens, managers have used forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras to detect dens, but the effectiveness of FLIR under different environmental conditions is unresolved. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of environmental variables on FLIR-based techniques for arctic bear den detection. Using a FLIR-equipped unmanned aircraft system (UAS), we conducted observations of artificial polar bear (APD) and grizzly bear (AGD) dens from horizontal and vertical perspectives between December 2016 and April 2017. We recorded physical characteristics of artificial dens and weather conditions present during each observation. We captured 291 images and classified each as detection or nondetection based on the number of pixels representative of a den "hot spot." We used logistic regression to model the effects of four weather variables on the odds of detection (detection). We found that UAS-FLIR detects APDs two times better than AGDs, and that for both species detections are four times more likely from the vertical than horizontal perspective. Lower air temperature and wind speed, and the absence of precipitation and sunlight increased detection for APDs. A 1 degrees C increase in air temperature lowered detection by 12% for APDs and by 8% for AGDs. We recommend that UAS-FLIR surveys be conducted early in the denning season, on cold, clear days, with calm winds, in the absence of sunlight (e.g., civil twilight). Our study further refines the application of FLIR techniques for arctic bear den detection and offers practical recommendations for optimizing detection. Putative den locations should be confirmed by a secondary method to minimize disturbance as anthropogenic activity continues in the Arctic.

TI  - Risk-Adapted Cutoffs in Colorectal Cancer Screening by Fecal Immunochemical Tests
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) for hemoglobin are increasingly used in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. The use of uniform positivity thresholds (cutoffs) within screening populations is expected to imply lower positive predictive values (PPVs) and higher numbers of colonoscopies needed (numbers needed to scope [NNSs]) to detect advanced neoplasms among screening participants at lower risk compared with those at higher risk. We aimed to assess such variation and its potential implications in a large screening cohort.METHODS: A quantitative FIT (FOB Gold; Sentinel Diagnostics, Milan, Italy) was conducted in fecal samples collected by 4,332 participants of screening colonoscopy before bowel preparation. Participants were classified into 3 risk groups (low, medium, and high) by tertiles of a previously derived risk-factor-based risk score. We determined the variation of PPVs and NNSs for detecting advanced neoplasms (i.e., CRC or advanced adenoma) when using the same FIT cutoffs and variation of FIT cutoffs that would yield uniform PPVs across risk groups.RESULTS: When a fixed FIT cutoff of 10 mu g/g was used, the PPV increased from 23.3% to 41.8% from the low- to the high-risk group, with NNS decreasing from 4.3 to 2.4 (P< 0.001). Similar variations of PPVs and NNSs across risk groups were observed at higher FIT cutoffs. When risk group-specific cutoffs were defined to achieve fixed PPVs of 25%, 30%, and 35% across all risk groups, cutoffs varied from 5.3 to 11.4, 6.5 to 18.7, and 7.5 to 31.0 mu g hemoglobin/g feces, respectively, between high- and low-risk groups (P< 0.05 for all differences).DISCUSSION: Using risk-adapted cutoffs may help to achieve target levels of PPV and NNS and might be an option to consider for personalized FIT-based CRC screening.

TI  - Reconstruction of the 2018 tsunamigenic flank collapse and eruptive activity at Anak Krakatau based on eyewitness reports, seismo-acoustic and satellite observations
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - After several months of eruptive activity, the subaerial cone of Anak Krakatau collapsed on December 22, 2018. The landslide event generated a tsunami that had deadly consequences within the Sunda Strait in Indonesia. Such significant collapse events are common in the geologic record but are a rare phenomenon, in the instrumented record. However, these events can have a potentially large impact on society. We have reconstructed the collapse, along with the activity preceding and following it, by combining information from official reports, remote geophysical observations, and local eyewitness accounts. It appears that the collapse of Anak Krakatau's subaerial cone led to a drastic change in the eruptive style from continuous Strombolian explosions to sustained Surtseyan. Those changes are detectable in the seismo-acoustic measurements, which, when combined with eyewitnesses, allows us to reconstruct the timing and phenomenology of the sequence. Our analysis reveals that intense eruptive activity generated sustained infrasound, unusual but not unique at Anak Krakatau, starting approximately eight hours before the collapse. Within this timeframe, two seismic signals consistent with minor mass movements as well as a momentary quiescence were identified prior to the main collapse. The data presented here indicate that Anak Krakatau failed in one collapse event, producing a tsunami with multiple waves around the volcano, the last one being the largest. Following the collapse, three volcanic plumes could be clearly identified in the satellite data and by eyewitnesses, as well as spectral lines in the seismic data. These lines, observed up to 371 km, suggest a repeating energetic explosive source lasting for seven days. The collapse produced multiple infrasound arrivals observed at regional infrasound stations, but was not recorded on the regional hydroacoustic network. Our analysis of the eruptive sequence demonstrates that a detailed eruption chronology can be reconstructed using remote methods, even in the event of failure or destruction of local monitoring infrastructure. This event also highlights that tsunamigenic flank collapses can occur with little to no warning, and be difficult to interpret in real-time, as a significant amount of non-operational analysis was required after the event, to complete the chronology.

TI  - Life history of an anticyclonic eddy in the Algerian basin from altimetry data, tracking algorithm and in situ observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequently-forming long-life mesoscale eddies are observed in the Algerian Basin that influence the circulation of the wider Western Mediterranean Sea. Most of these structures store and transport water masses including associated physical and biological properties throughout the entire basin.In order to study the evolution of a long-life anticyclonic eddy, we use a multiplatform approach based on remote sensing data analysis and in situ measurements. We present a case study of an anticyclonic eddy that persisted for 17 months within the basin. The feature was identified through a hybrid method of eddy detection and tracking applied to altimetry data, and sampled twice during two different oceanographic cruises in autumn 2004 and late spring 2005. Transect observations of potential temperature, salinity, density and the dissolved oxygen concentration were utilised to infer water mass properties and eddy characteristics. In situ data show that water of Atlantic origin, initially trapped by the eddy during its formation, was modified during the eddy lifetime.The time evolution of radius, kinetic energy and vorticity suggests dividing the eddy lifetime into three phases: the eddy formation, an intermediate period of high variability and a final, lower energy phase. The track followed by the eddy confirms the hypothesis of an interaction with the North Balearic Front and a consequent change of the eddy's physical properties.Decomposing the eddy's kinetic energy into mean and fluctuating terms allows us to describe its interaction with the mean circulation of the basin. In particular during formation, the southern part of the eddy absorbs energy from the mean circulation, while it provides energy to the mean flow in its northern part. In the second phase, when the eddy is far from the coast, it receives energy from the mean flow.Combining in situ data analysis with the results of the satellite-imagery-based detection and tracking method has proven to be a very useful method in assessing the evolution of a mesoscale structure in the Algerian Basin and its interaction with the large scale ocean dynamics of the Western Mediterranean Sea.

TI  - Assessing and modelling vulnerability to dengue in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam by geospatial and time-series approaches
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue fever has continuously been a disease burden in Vietnam during the last 20 years, particularly in the Mekong Delta region (MDR), which is one of the most vulnerable to climate change. Variations in temperature and precipitation are likely to alter the incidence and distribution of vector-borne diseases such as dengue. This study focuses on assessing dengue risk via the vulnerability concept, which is composed of exposure and susceptibility using a combined approach of mapping and modelling for the MDR of Vietnam during the period between 2001 and 2016. Multisource remote sensing data from Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrophotometer (MODIS) was used for presenting climate and environment variables in mapping and modelling vulnerability. Monthly and yearly maps of vulnerability to dengue in the MDR, produced for 15-year period, aided analysis of the temporal and spatial patterns of vulnerability to dengue in the study region and were used for constructing time-series modelling of vulnerability for the following year. The results showed that there is a clear seasonal variation in the vulnerability due to variability of the climate factor and its strong dispersion across the study region, with higher vulnerability in the scattered areas of urban and mixed horticulture land and lower vulnerability in areas covered by forest and bare soil lands. The Pearson's correlation was applied to evaluate the association between dengue rates and vulnerability values aggregated at the provincial level. Reasonable linear association, with correlation coefficients of 0.41-0.63, was found in two-thirds of the provinces. The predicted vulnerabilities to dengue during 2016 were comparable with the estimated values and trends for most provinces of the MDR. Our demonstrated approach with integrated geospatial data seems to be a promising tool in supporting the public health sector in assessing potential space and time of a subsequent increase in vulnerability to dengue, particularly in the context of climate change.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Data for Land Cover/Use Mapping: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The advancement in satellite remote sensing technology has revolutionised the approaches to monitoring the Earth's surface. The development of the Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth's surface by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2 mission is to provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2) exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g., forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring, specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2 images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data, especially in developing countries where financial resources for the acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies (>80%) with machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use monitoring.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF MUNICIPAL MERGERS ON LOCAL PUBLIC SPENDING: EVIDENCE FROM REMOTE-SENSING DATA
T2  - JOURNAL OF EAST ASIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - How are resources distributed when administrative units merge? We take advantage of recent, large-scale municipal mergers in Japan to systematically study the impact of municipal mergerswithinmerged municipalities and, in particular, what politicians do when their districts and constituencies suddenly change. We argue that when rural and sparsely populated municipalities merge with more urban and densely populated municipalities, residents of the former are likely to see a reduced share of public spending because they lost political leverage through the merger. Our empirical analyses detect changes in public spending before and after the municipal mergers with remote sensing data, which allows for flexible units of analysis and enables us to proxy for spendingwithinmerged municipalities. Overall, our results show that politicians tend to reduce benefits allocated to areas where there are a small number of voters, while increasing the allocation to more populous areas. The micro-foundation of our argument is also corroborated by survey data. The finding suggests that, all things being equal, the quantity rather than quality of electorates matters for politicians immediately after political units change.

TI  - Correcting the Edge Effect for Sensor Spatial Response in Evapotranspiration Estimation through Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in remote-sensing technology using multispectral images provide a powerful tool to estimate crop-water evapotranspiration (ET) at the watershed scale with large spatial and temporal precision. However, most current sensors onboard operational satellites that capture radiances from the thermal infrared (TIR) spectral region are still constrained by limited spatial resolution, which creates a potential error called the edge effect. This consists of information intrusion from surrounding areas that crosses the boundary of the region of interest due to coarse pixel resolution. To reduce this error, a buffer zone is defined as a fixed distance from the field boundary, and the information contained in this zone is excluded from the sample. This study evaluates the optimal buffer distance needed to minimize the bias associated with the aggregated edge effect in annual ET estimates when using Landsat-7 enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) data. Theoretical and statistical analyses indicate that a buffer of 2-TIR pixel equivalent distance ensures that the remaining field area contain radiances free of edge effects with 98.4% confidence. However, the analysis shows that in a circular turfgrass field of 50.9 ha, this process would eliminate half of the area. The analysis using annual ET data shows that applying a buffer distance of 0.75 TIR pixel is sufficient to mitigate the cumulative edge effect while preserving field representative valuable data. Although this analysis was based on Landsat-7 ETM+ images, the results could also be applied to annual ET maps with different thermal infrared pixel sizes.

TI  - A Novel Framework Based on Polarimetric Change Vectors for Unsupervised Multiclass Change Detection in Dual-Pol Intensity SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection (CD) is a crucial topic in many remote sensing applications. In the recent years, satellite polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) systems (e.g., the Sentinel-1 constellation) became a suitable tool for multitemporal monitoring due to the regular acquisitions with a short revisit time in different polarimetric channels. Methods for CD in PolSAR data mainly focus on binary CD (i.e., they provide information about the presence/absence of change only), whereas the polarimetric enhanced information provides multiple features that can be exploited for performing multiclass CD. In this article, we introduce a novel framework for the characterization of multitemporal changes in dual-polarimetric data. The framework is based on the definition of polarimetric change vectors (PCVs) and their representation in a polar coordinate system. PCVs allow characterizing and, thus, to separate multiclass changes in terms of target properties of the single-time scenes and the scattering theory. The proposed model is used to: 1) derive the statistical behaviors of change and no change classes in PolSAR multitemporal images; 2) design an automatic and unsupervised strategy to estimate the optimal number of changes; and 3) distinguish no change from change classes and the kinds of change from each other. An experimental analysis has been conducted on three multitemporal PolSAR data sets having different complexities in terms of number and kinds of change classes. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the better performance with respect to both specific techniques for CD in dual-pol SAR data and a general multiclass CD method, not designed for PolSAR data.

TI  - Simple vaginal trachelectomy in women with early-stage low-risk cervical cancer who wish to preserve fertility: the new standard of care?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective There is a trend toward less radical surgery in women with small-volume disease who wish to preserve fertility. The objective of our study was to evaluate the oncologic and obstetrical outcome of simple vaginal trachelectomy and lymph node assessment in patients with low-risk early-stage cervical cancer (<2 cm). Methods From May 2007 to January 2020, 50 patients underwent a simple vaginal trachelectomy/conization with laparoscopic sentinel lymph node mapping +/- complete pelvic node dissection. Patients underwent loop electrocautery excision (LEEP), cone/cervical biopsies, or simple trachelectomy. A preoperative pelvic MRI with gadolinium contrast was systematically performed in all cases. The size of the lesion was established by review of the LEEP, cone or trachelectomy specimen, MRI, and clinical examination. Data was collected prospectively in a computerized database. Descriptive statistics and the Kaplan-Meier estimate were used for analysis. Results The median age was 29 years (range: 21-44) and 35 (70%) patients were nulliparous. As per FIGO 2009 classification, 11 patients had stage IA1 with lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), 13 patients had stage IA2, and 26 patients had stage IB1. Twenty-six patients had squamous histology, 20 patients adenocarcinoma, and four patients other histologies. On final pathology, lymph nodes were negative in 46 patients (92%), three patients had isolated tumor cells, and one patient had micrometastasis. Thirty patients (60%) had either no residual disease in the trachelectomy specimen (22) or residual dysplasia only (eight). With a median follow-up of 76 months (range: 1-140), only one local recurrence occurred which was treated initially with chemoradiation. She recurred again locally and underwent a pelvic exenteration: the patient progressed again and died of disease. The 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival was 97.9% and 97.6%, respectively. There were 40 pregnancies: five (12.5%) ended in the first trimester, one (2.5%) in the second trimester, and three (7.5%) were late preterm: all the others (30 or 75%) delivered >36 weeks and one pregnancy is ongoing. Conclusion Simple trachelectomy/conization and lymph node assessment is an oncologically safe fertility-preserving surgery in well-selected patients with low-risk early-stage cervical cancer (<2 cm). Obstetrical outcomes are comparable to the general population.

TI  - Management of Malignant Vulval Melanoma: A Retrospective Case Series and Review of the Literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF LOWER GENITAL TRACT DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives The aims of the study were to evaluate clinicopathologic features, management, and outcomes in vulval melanoma and to review the literature. Materials and Methods Data were collected retrospectively on patients with vulval melanoma from 2001 to 2017 in 5 gynecological oncology cancer centers (Bristol, Taunton, Truro, Plymouth, and Cheltenham). SPSS software was used for univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Disease-specific median survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves. Results Forty-four patients with vulval melanoma were included, with a median age of 71 years. Forty-three of 44 had wide local excision with full inguinal lymphadenectomy if abnormal lymph nodes. Seven patients had sentinel lymph nodes. However, 2 patients with negative sentinel lymph nodes had distant recurrences within 16 months. On univariate analysis, presence of ulceration (p= .012), perineural invasion (p= .03), and area of lesion (p= .016) were associated with risk of recurrence but only presence of microsatellites (p= .01) was associated with risk of death. There were 31 deaths (70%): 29 (94%) of 31 from melanoma and 28 (64%) of 44 recurrences: 17 local (10 groin, 7 vulval) and 9 distant. Overall median survival was 32.5 months (95% CI, 17.8-46.5 months) and median recurrence-free survival 12.6 months (95% CI, 7.7-17.4 months). Conclusions This retrospective multicenter study highlights the high recurrence rate and poor prognosis of vulval melanoma. Lymph node surgery did not make any difference to recurrence-free survival or overall survival. The presence of microsatellites was associated with a statistically increased risk of death.

TI  - Quantifying Aboveground Biomass of Shrubs Using Spectral and Structural Metrics Derived from UAS Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrub-dominated ecosystems support biodiversity and play an important storage role in the global carbon cycle. However, it is challenging to characterize biophysical properties of low-stature vegetation like shrubs from conventional ground-based or remotely sensed data. We used spectral and structural variables derived from high-resolution unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery to estimate the aboveground biomass of shrubs in theBetulaandSalixgenera in a montane meadow in Banff National Park, Canada using an area-based approach. In single-variable linear regression models, visible light (RGB) indices outperformed multispectral or structural data. A linear model based on the red ratio vegetation index (VI) accumulated over shrub area could model biomass (calibration R-2= 0.888; validation R-2= 0.774) nearly as well as the top multivariate linear regression models (calibration R-2= 0.896; validation R-2> 0.750), which combined an accumulated RGB VI with a multispectral metric. The excellent performance of accumulated RGB VIs represents a novel approach to fine-scale vegetation biomass estimation, fusing spectral and spatial information into a single parsimonious metric that rivals the performance of more complex multivariate models. Methods developed in this study will be relevant to researchers interested in estimating fine-scale shrub aboveground biomass within a range of ecosystems.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PURE & APPLIED PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Light sources are used extensively at various stages of development and characterization of an electro-optical (EO) payload like Cartosat, HySIS, Microsat etc. These sources are required to characterize many critical parameters of E0 payload like photo response non uniformity (PRNU), noise performance, saturation radiance etc. Currently integrating sphere with quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) lamp is widely used for payload characterization. These lamp sources generally operate in continuous mode in clean room environment and thermo-vacuum. In case of high resolution payloads, time-delay and integration (TDI) detectors are used to improve signal collection. For characterization and testing of such payloads multi-mode (pulsed and continuous) light source (switching at kHz rate in synchronization with payload electronics) with specific spectral range is required. Pulse mode operation requirement cannot be met using QTH lamps. To cater to such need a LED based indigenous source has been developed. This paper delineates circuit design and implementation of driver and characteristics of the source is also discussed. Proposed source is capable to synchronize and operate in multi-mode with external clock pulse with high achieved linearity (>99%) and high stability (>99%) in vacuum condition.

TI  - Indirect etiquette patterns in bribri everyday life
T2  - CUADERNOS DE ANTROPOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes the category of indirect etiquette patterns as a construct that makes it easier to organize collective behaviors of the Bribri and Cabecar indigenous groups of Costa Rica. Therefore, it informs about frequent patterns in everyday life designed to avoid confrontation with people or their surroundings. The authors gathered data through ethnographic field work carried out at different times, most recently between 2014 and 2017 (by Pozo), and the earliest ones between 1970 and 1980 (by Bozzoli). Data also comes from reviewing literature. The concept was discussed with elderly people of the community (Kekepa), who expressed their interpretation according to Bribri thought. The discussants are residents of the Lari and Coen valleys of Talamanca. Indirect behavioral patterns of communication turned out to be classifiable into subcategories: indirect conversation, use of substitute codes and protocols of respect. Indirect etiquette is a descriptive category which has not been used in previous ethnographic literature; it was found to facilitate organizing indirect observances and their possible explanations. Indirect patterns avoid conflict and preserve meaning related to identity and worldview; knowing about them helps the outsider to Bribri customs to establish better relationships with the Bribri communities.

T2  - RESEARCH STUDIES IN MUSIC EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The inclusion of local Indigenous knowledge, pedagogy, and worldview in music education is increasingly relevant to music educators globally. This article contributes to the extensive body of knowledge already written on the subject by focusing on the contribution of such inclusion to localized societal change. My doctoral study examined the growth and contributions of bridging social capital to rural community vitality in British Columbia (BC), Canada via three school-community music education partnerships. I found that the members of one of those partnerships, the International Choral Kathaumixw Festival in Powell River, BC, engaged in ongoing cultural dialogue with local Tla'amin First Nation members over a 30-year period in order to foster meaningful inclusion of local cultural practices in that festival. This cultural dialogue ultimately contributed to more harmonious social, cultural, political, and economic relationships between settler and Tla'amin First Nation populations. The mandate of the festival, the ongoing music making activities that featured Tla'amin themes and cultural participation, the large contingent of local community volunteers and performers, and the physical commons created by music making all contributed to a shift in relations between the community of Powell River and the Tla'amin First Nation. I offer that the bridging social capital fostered by this partnership may provide insight and direction for music educators globally who wish to promote Indigenous cultural practices in their schools. A bridging social capital or relational approach based on long-term reciprocity with local Indigenous culture bearers may help music educators work towards more culturally appropriate/responsive curriculum and pedagogy in their practice.

TI  - Monitoring the Ice Phenology of Qinghai Lake from 1980 to 2018 Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice, one of the most direct lake physical characteristics affected by climate change, can reflect small-scale environmental changes caused by the atmosphere and hydrology, as well as large-scale climate changes such as global warming. This study uses National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA AVHRR), MOD09GQ surface reflectance products, and Landsat surface reflectance Tier 1 products, which comprehensively used RS and GIS technology to study lake ice phenology (LIP) and changes in Qinghai Lake. Over the past 38 years, freeze-up start and freeze-up end dates were gradually delayed by a rate of 0.16 d/a and 0.19 d/a, respectively, with a total delay by 6.08 d and 7.22 d. The dates of break-up start and break-up end showed advancing trends by -0.36 d/a and -0.42 d/a, respectively, which shifted them earlier by 13.68 d and 15.96 d. Overall, ice coverage duration, freeze duration, and complete freeze duration showed decreasing trends of -0.58 d/a, -0.60 d/a, and -0.52 d/a, respectively, and overall decreased by 22.04 d, 22.81 d, and 9.76 d between 1980 and 2018. The spatial pattern in the freeze-thaw of Qinghai Lake can be divided into two areas; the west of the lake area has similar spatial patterns of freezing and ablation, while, in the east of the lake area, freezing and ablation patterns are opposite. Climate factors were closely related to LIP, especially the accumulated freezing degree-day (AFDD) from October to April of the following year. Furthermore, freeze-up start time was more sensitive to changes in wind speed and precipitation.

TI  - Retrieving Crop Leaf Chlorophyll Content Using an Improved Look-Up-Table Approach by Combining Multiple Canopy Structures and Soil Backgrounds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is a pivotal parameter in the monitoring of agriculture and carbon cycle modeling at regional and global scales. ENVISAT MERIS and Sentinel-3 OLCI data are suitable for use in the global monitoring of LCC because of their spectral specifications (covering red-edge bands), wide field of view and short revisit times. Generally, remote sensing approaches for LCC retrieval consist of statistically- and physically-based models. The physical approaches for LCC estimation require the use of radiative transfer models (RTMs), which are more robust and transferrable than empirical models. However, the operational retrieval of LCC at large scales is affected by the large variability in canopy structures and soil backgrounds. In this study, we proposed an improved look-up-table (LUT) approach to retrieve LCC by combining multiple canopy structures and soil backgrounds to deal with the ill-posed inversion problem caused by the lack of prior knowledge on canopy structure and soil-background reflectance. Firstly, the PROSAIL-D model was used to simulate canopy spectra with diverse imaging gometrics, canopy structures, soil backgrounds and leaf biochemical contents, and the canopy spectra were resampled according to the spectral response functions of ENVISAT MERIS and Sentinel-3 OLCI instruments. Then, an LUT that included 25 sub-LUTs corresponding to five types of canopy structure and five types of soil background was generated for LCC estimation. The mean of the best eight solutions, rather than the single best solution with the smallest RMSE value, was selected as the retrieval of each sub-LUT. The final inversion result was obtained by calculating the mean value of the 25 sub-LUTs. Finally, the improved LUT approach was tested using simulations, field measurements and ENVISAT MERIS satellite data. A simulation using spectral bands from the MERIS and Sentinel-3 OLCI simulation datasets yielded an R(2)value of 0.81 and an RMSE value of 10.1 mu g cm(-2). Validation performed well with field-measured canopy spectra and MERIS imagery giving RMSE values of 9.9 mu g cm(-2) for wheat and 9.6 mu g cm(-2) for soybean using canopy spectra and 8.6 mu g cm(-2) for soybean using MERIS data. The comparison with traditional chlorophyll-sensitive indices showed that our improved LUT approach gave the best performance for all cases. Therefore, these promising results are directly applicable to the use of ENVISAT MERIS and Sentinel-3 OLCI data for monitoring of crop LCC at a regional or global scale.

TI  - A Novel Feature Extension Method for the Forest Disaster Monitoring Using Multispectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images classification is the key technology for monitoring forest changes. Texture features have been demonstrated to have better effectiveness than spectral features in the improvement of the classification accuracy. The accuracy of extracting texture information by window-based method depends on the choice of the window size. Moreover, the size should ideally match the spatial scale of the object or class under consideration. However, most of the existing texture feature extraction methods are all based on a single window and do not adequately consider the scale of different objects. Our first proposition is to use a composite window for extracting texture features, which is a small window surrounded by a larger window. Our second proposition is to reinforce the performance of the trained ensemble classifier by training it using only the most important features. Considering the advantages of random forest classifier, such as fast training speed and few parameters, these features feed this classifier. Measures of feature importance are estimated along with the growth of the base classifiers, here decision trees. We aim to classify each pixel of the forest images disturbed by hurricanes and fires in three classes,damaged,not damaged, orunknown, as this could be used to compute time-dependent aggregates. In this study, two research areas-Nezer Forest in France and Blue Mountain Forest in Australia-are utilized to validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical simulations show increased performance and improved monitoring ability of forest disturbance when using these two propositions. When compared with the reference methods, the best increase of the overall accuracy obtained by the proposed algorithm is 4.77% and 2.96% on the Nezer forest data and Blue Mountain forest data, respectively.

TI  - Retrieval of Marine Surface Slick Dielectric Properties From Radarsat-2 Data via a Polarimetric Two-Scale Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose the use of a polarimetric two-scale surface scattering model to retrieve the dielectric parameters of oil slick from the polarimetric synthetic aperture radar. The ocean surface is modeled as an ensemble of randomly orientated, slightly roughened, tilted facets, for which the small perturbation model is assumed to be valid under the condition of no tilt. The orientation of the random facets causes a variation in the in-plane and out-of-plane tilt angles. As the original model utilizes both the co-polarization and cross-polarization channels to determine both the dielectric and roughness characteristics simultaneously from a series of look-up tables, the model is adapted from its original form in order to estimate the roughness characteristics of the scattering surface first, before the dielectric properties are inferred. The performance of the altered scattering model is then evaluated by applying it to multiple sets of quad-polarimetric data containing verified oil slicks, acquired from oil-on-water clean-up exercises in the North Sea. Histograms of retrieved values for the modulus of the dielectric constant indicate that the model is able to invert for values similar to the actual value of 2.3, the dielectric constant of pure crude oil at the lower limit, with successively higher values being found up to values of approximately 20 at the edges of the slicks. An error evaluation is also presented and demonstrates that sources of error are related to the alteration of the model to suit co-polarimetric data and the variance of the speckle that is related to the size of the averaging window. While the results are interesting, the approach is limited to the use of only the ratio of the co-polarimetric channels, from which two unknowns are estimated.

TI  - Enhanced burn severity estimation using fine resolution ET and MESMA fraction images with machine learning algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Successful post-fire management depends on accurate burn severity maps that are increasingly derived from satellite data, replacing field-based estimates. Post-fire vegetation and soil changes, besides modifying the reflected and emitted radiation recorded by sensors onboard satellites, strongly alters water balance in the fire affected area. While fire-induced spectral changes can be well represented by fraction images from Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA), changes in water balance are mainly registered by evapotranspiration (ET). As both types of variables have a clear physical meaning, they can be easily understood in terms of burn severity, providing a clear advantage compared to widely-used spectral indices. In this research work, we evaluate the potential of Landsat-derived ET to estimate burn severity, together with MESMA derived Sentinel-2 fraction images and important environment variables (pre-fire vegetation, climate, topography). In this study, we use the random forest (RF) classifier, which provides information on variable importance allowing us to identify the combination of input variables that provided the most accurate estimate. Our study area is located in Central Portugal, where a mega-fire burned > 450 km(2) from 17 to 24 June 2017. We used the official burn severity map as ground reference. The RF algorithm identified ET as the most important variable in the burn severity model, followed by MESMA char fractions. When both ET and MESMA char fraction image were used as RF inputs, burn severity estimates reached higher accuracy than if only one of them was used, which suggests their potential synergetic interaction. In particular, when environmental variables were used in addition to ET and char fraction, the highest accuracy for burn severity was reached (kappa = 0.79). Our main conclusion is that post-fire fine resolution ET is a useful and easily understandable indicator of burn severity in Mediterranean ecosystems, in particular when used in combination with a MESMA char fraction image. This novel approach to estimate burn severity may help to develop successful post-fire management strategies not only in Mediterranean ecosystems but also in other ecosystems, due to ease of generalization.

TI  - Watershed Modeling with Remotely Sensed Big Data: MODIS Leaf Area Index Improves Hydrology and Water Quality Predictions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional watershed modeling often overlooks the role of vegetation dynamics. There is also little quantitative evidence to suggest that increased physical realism of vegetation dynamics in process-based models improves hydrology and water quality predictions simultaneously. In this study, we applied a modified Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to quantify the extent of improvements that the assimilation of remotely sensed Leaf Area Index (LAI) would convey to streamflow, soil moisture, and nitrate load simulations across a 16,860 km(2)agricultural watershed in the midwestern United States. We modified the SWAT source code to automatically override the model's built-in semiempirical LAI with spatially distributed and temporally continuous estimates from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Compared to a "basic" traditional model with limited spatial information, our LAI assimilation model (i) significantly improved daily streamflow simulations during medium-to-low flow conditions, (ii) provided realistic spatial distributions of growing season soil moisture, and (iii) substantially reproduced the long-term observed variability of daily nitrate loads. Further analysis revealed that the overestimation or underestimation of LAI imparted a proportional cascading effect on how the model partitions hydrologic fluxes and nutrient pools. As such, assimilation of MODIS LAI data corrected the model's LAI overestimation tendency, which led to a proportionally increased rootzone soil moisture and decreased plant nitrogen uptake. With these new findings, our study fills the existing knowledge gap regarding vegetation dynamics in watershed modeling and confirms that assimilation of MODIS LAI data in watershed models can effectively improve both hydrology and water quality predictions.

AB  - Ramirez-Campillo, R, Alvarez, C, Gentil, P, Loturco, I, Sanchez-Sanchez, J, Izquierdo, M, Moran, J, Nakamura, FY, Chaabene, H, and Granacher, U. Sequencing effects of plyometric training applied before or after regular soccer training on measures of physical fitness in young players.J Strength Cond Res34(7): 1959-1966, 2020-To compare the effects of short-term (i.e., 7 weeks) plyometric jump training applied before (PJT-B) or after (PJT-A) soccer practice on components of physical fitness in young soccer players, a single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted. Postpubertal boys aged 17.0 +/- 0.5 years were allocated to 3 groups: PJT-B (n= 12), PJT-A (n= 14), and control (CON;n= 12). The outcome measures included tests to evaluate 20-m speed, standing long jump (SLJ), squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), and drop jump (DJ), 20-m multistage shuttle run endurance (MSSRT), and Illinois change-of-direction speed (ICODT). Although the CON performed soccer-specific training, the PJT-A and PJT-B groups conducted the same soccer-specific sessions but replaced similar to 11% of their time with plyometric training. The PJT-B group performed plyometric exercises after a warm-up program, and the PJT-A group conducted plyometric exercises similar to 10 minutes after the completion of soccer training. Analyses of variance were used to detect differences between groups in all variables for pretraining and posttraining tests. Main effects of time (allp< 0.01;d= 0.19-0.79) and group x time interactions (allp <= 0.05;d= 0.17-0.76) were observed for all examined variables. Post hoc analyses revealed significant increases in the PJT-B group (SLJ: 9.4%,d= 1.7; CMJ: 11.2%,d= 0.75; 20-m MSSRT: 9.0%,d= 0.77) and the PJT-A group (SLJ: 3.1%,d= 0.7; CMJ: 4.9%,d= 0.27; 20-m MSSRT: 9.0%,d= 0.76). Post hoc analyses also revealed significant increases in the PJT-B group (20-m speed: -7.4%,d= 0.75; 20-cm DJ reactive strength index: 19.1%,d= 1.4; SJ: 6.3%,d= 0.44; ICODT results: -4.2%,d= 1.1). In general, our study revealed that plyometric training is effective in improving measures of physical fitness in young male soccer players when combined with regular soccer training. More specifically, larger training-induced effects on physical fitness were registered if plyometric training was conducted before soccer-specific training.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation of Urban Heat Islands for Implementing Nature-Based Solutions: A Case Study of Kurunegala, Sri Lanka
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the urban landscape resulting from rapid urbanisation and climate change have the potential to increase land surface temperature (LST) and the incidence of the urban heat island (UHI). An increase in urban heat directly affects urban livelihoods and systems. This study investigated the spatiotemporal variation of the UHI in the Kurunegala urban area (KUA) of North-Western Province, Sri Lanka. The KUA is one of the most intensively developing economic and administrative capitals in Sri Lanka with an urban system that is facing climate vulnerabilities and challenges of extreme heat conditions. We examined the UHI formation for the period 1996-2019 and its impact on the urban-systems by exploring nature-based solutions (NBS). This study used annual median temperatures based on Landsat data from 1996 to 2019 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Various geospatial approaches, including spectral index-based land use/cover mapping (1996, 2009 and 2019), urban-rural gradient zones, UHI profile, statistics and grid-based analysis, were used to analyse the data. The results revealed that the mean LST increased by 5.5 degrees C between 1996 and 2019 mainly associated with the expansion pattern of impervious surfaces. The mean LST had a positive correlation with impervious surfaces and a negative correlation with the green spaces in all the three time-points. Impacts due to climate change, including positive temperature and negative rainfall anomalies, contributed to the increase in LST. The study recommends interactively applying NBS to addressing the UHI impacts with effective mitigation and adaptation measures for urban sustainability.

TI  - Epistaxis presenting as sentinel feature of metastatic renal cell carcinoma: A case report and review of literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND PRIMARY CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - About 30% of all newly diagnosed renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients present with synchronous metastatic disease. Usual organs of involvement are lung (75%), soft tissues (36%), bone (20%), liver (18%), cutaneous sites (8%), and central nervous system (8%). Metastases to the paranasal sinuses (PNS) are relatively common and may be a part of synchronous multiorgan involvement or present in follow-up after radical nephrectomy (metachronous); but primary presentation as isolated paranasal mass before the diagnosis of RCC is extremely rare. Here, we report a case of 74-year-old female presented with epistaxis and nasal obstruction. On evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a heterogeneously enhancing mass was found involving left PNS. Biopsy from mass revealed clear cell RCC. Later on, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed enhancing mass from the upper pole of the left kidney with no evidence of metastasis elsewhere. The patient was started on pazopanib 800 mg once a day. At 6 months follow-up scan, there was a partial response at both primary as well as metastatic site.

TI  - Emerging themes to support ambitious UK marine biodiversity conservation
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Healthy marine ecosystems provide a wide range of resources and services that support life on Earth and contribute to human wellbeing. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are accepted as an important tool for the restoration and maintenance of marine ecosystem structure, function, health and ecosystem integrity through the conservation of significant species, habitats, or entire ecosystems. In recent years there has been a rapid expansion in the area of ocean designated as an MPA. Despite this progress in spatial protection targets and the progressive knowledge of the essential interdependence between the human and the ocean system, marine biodiversity continues to decline, placing in jeopardy the range of ecosystem services benefits humans rely on. There is a need to address this shortcoming. Ambitious marine conservation:Requires a shift from managing individual marine features within MPAs to whole-sites to enable repair and renewal of marine systems;Reflects an ambition for sustainable livelihoods by fully integrating fisheries management with conservation (Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management) as the two are critically interdependent;Establishes a world class and cost effective ecological and socio-economic monitoring and evaluation framework that includes the use of controls and sentinel sites to improve sustainability in marine management; andChallenges policy makers and practitioners to be progressive by integrating MPAs into the wider seascape as critical functional components rather than a competing interest and move beyond MPAs as the only tool to underpin the benefits derived from marine ecosystems by identifying other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) to establish synergies with wider governance frameworks.

TI  - Early Identification of Seed Maize and Common Maize Production Fields Using Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely access to the production area of crop seeds allows the seed market and secure seed supply to be monitored. Seed maize and common maize production fields typically share similar phenological development profiles with differences in the planting patterns, which makes it challenging to separate these fields from decametric-resolution satellite images. In this research, we proposed a method to identify seed maize production fields as early as possible in the growing season using a time series of remote sensing images in the Liangzhou district of Gansu province, China. We collected Sentinel-2 and GaoFen-1 (GF-1) images captured from March to September. The feature space for classification consists of four original bands, namely red, green, blue, and near-infrared (nir), and eight vegetation indexes. We analyzed the timeliness of seed maize identification using Sentinel-2 time series of different time spans and identified the earliest time frame for reasonable classification accuracy. Then, the earliest time series that met the requirements of regulatory accuracy were compared and analyzed. Four machine/deep learning algorithms were tested, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector classification (SVC), random forest (RF), and long short-term memory (LSTM). The results showed that using Sentinel-2 images from March to June, the RF and LSTM algorithms achieve over 88% accuracy, with the LSTM performing the best (90%). In contrast, the accuracy of KNN and SVC was between 82% and 86%. At the end of June, seed maize mapping can be carried out in the experimental area, and the precision can meet the basic requirements of monitoring for the seed industry. The classification using GF-1 images were less accurate and reliable; the accuracy was 85% using images from March to June. To achieve near real-time identification of seed maize fields early in the growing season, we adopted an automated sample generation approach for the current season using only historical samples based on clustering analysis. The classification accuracy using new samples extracted from historical mapping reached 74% by the end of the season (September) and 63% by the end of July. This research provides important insights into the classification of crop fields cultivated with the same crop but different planting patterns using remote sensing images. The approach proposed by this study enables near-real time identification of seed maize production fields within the growing season, which could effectively support large-scale monitoring of the seed supply industry.

TI  - Monitoring water discharge and floodplain connectivity for the northern Andes utilizing satellite data: A tool for river planning and science-based decision-making
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - River discharge data and magnitudes of floods are often not readily available for decision makers of many developing nations, including Colombia. And this while flooding for these regions is often devastating, causing many fatalities and insurmountable damage to the most vulnerable communities. During the we season, in strong La Nina years, infrastructural damages of over $US 7.2 billion have occurred. Mitigation of such natural disasters lacks data-supported scientific approaches for evaluating river response to extreme climate events. Here, we propose a satellite-based technique to measure river discharge at selected sites for the main northern Andean River, the Magdalena. This method has the advantage of back calculating daily river discharges over a period of two decades, and thus making it possible to calculate return intervals of significant flood events. The study shows that satellite based river discharges well capture a) the inter-annual variability of river discharge; b) the natural seasonality of water discharge along the floodplains; and c) peak discharges that were observed during La Nina conditions between 2008 and 2011. The last is likely more accurate compared to ground-based gauging stations, as ground-based stations tend to overflow during large flood events and as such are hampered to accurately monitor peak discharges. Furthermore, we show that these derived discharges can form the base to study river-floodplain connectivity, providing environmental decision makers with a technique that makes it possible to better monitor river and ecosystem processes.

TI  - Diagnostic value of sentinel lymph node scintigraphy and 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the detection of metastatic lymph nodes in patients with early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cervical cancer is staged clinically using the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics staging system. Although lymph node status does not form part of the staging, it has important prognostic and potential therapeutic implications. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of sentinel lymph node (SLN) scintigraphy and 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) in detecting lymph node metastases in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. Thirty-six patients with early-stage cervical cancer underwent SLN detection during primary operation. Of the 36 patients, 28 patients underwent18F-FDG PET/CT before surgery. The18F-FDG PET/CT images were analyzed with the histopathological findings as the reference standard. The diagnostic performance of18F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of nodal disease was reported in terms of accuracy value. The SLN detection rate was the highest (91.7%) using the combined method (lymphoscintigraphy, intraoperative gamma probe, and blue dye). Seven of the thirty-six patients had lymph node involvement (19.4%), of which five had preoperative18F-FDG PET/CT imaging. On overall patient-based analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of18F-FDG PET/CT were 40.0%, 78.3%, 28.6%, 85.7%, and 71.4%, respectively. The combination of radiolabeled nanocolloid with blue dye is safe and reliable and allows successful detection of SLNs in patients with early-stage cervical cancer in a population with high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus. The specificity and NPV of18F-FDG PET/CT are high and can be used in conjunction with SLN biopsy.

TI  - Computed tomography-based psoas skeletal muscle area and radiodensity are poor sentinels for whole L3 skeletal muscle values
T2  - CLINICAL NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims: Computed tomography (CT)-based measurement of skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and Hounsfield unit (HU) radiodensity are used to assess the presence of sarcopenia and myosteatosis, respectively. The validated CT-based technique involves analysis of skeletal muscle at the third lumbar vertebral (L3) level. Recently there has been increasing interest in the use of psoas muscle alone as a sentinel. However, this technique has not been extensively investigated or compared with the previous validated standard approach.Methods: Portovenous phase CT images at the L3 level were identified retrospectively from a single institution in 150 patients who had non-emergency scans and were analysed by a single assessor using SliceOmatic software v5.0 (TomoVision, Canada). Manual segmentation based upon validated HU thresholds for skeletal muscle density was performed for all skeletal muscle, as well as the individual muscle groups. The muscle CSA and mean radiodensity of each group were compared against the whole L3 slice values.Results: When compared with whole L3 slice CSA, anterior abdominal wall CSA had the strongest correlation (r = 0.9315, p < 0.0001) followed by paravertebral (r = 0.8948, p < 0.0001), then psoas muscle (r = 0.7041, p < 0.0001). The mean +/- SD density of the psoas muscle (42 +/- 8.4 HU) was significantly higher than the whole slice radiodensity (32.3 +/- 9.5 HU, p < 0.0001), with paravertebral radiodensity being a more accurate estimation (34.5 +/- 10.8 HU). There was a significant difference in the prevalence of myosteatosis when the density measured from the psoas was compared with that of the whole L3 skeletal muscle (27.7% vs. 66.0%, p < 0.0001).Conclusion: Whole L3 slice CSA correlated positively with psoas muscle CSA but was subject to wide variability in results. Psoas muscle radiodensity was significantly greater than whole L3 slice density and resulted in underestimation of the prevalence of myosteatosis. Given the lack of equivalence from individual muscle groups, we recommend that further work be undertaken to investigate which muscle group, or indeed whether the gold standard of whole L3 skeletal muscle, provides the best correlation with clinical outcomes.

TI  - Fifteen-year resilience against further degradation of Succulent Karoo vegetation in South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tankwa Karoo National Park (TKNP) is part of a renowned arid biome with unrivaled diversity in succulents. The park has been subject to anthropogenic pressures such as heavy grazing with climate change a recent threat. This study investigated changes in vegetation productivity between 2000 and 2014 across six vegetation types using rainfall and satellite data. The park is broadly divided into a plain at low altitude (316 m) receiving less rain and a wetter, higher terrain (1640 m). Long-term rainfall varied from 265 mm y-1 in the highland areas to 100 mm y-1 in the plains. There was a significant corresponding rise in NDVI from the low to the highlands (p < 0.001). Our analyses suggest that vegetation has stabilised since the park was proclaimed in 1984 because 81% of the area has remained uniform, on average, despite considerable variation on a vegetation type basis. Only 18% of the park had increasing productivity while just 2% experienced a decline. The patterns also suggest vegetation was principally controlled by rainfall, rather than a shift in land-use from rangeland to conservation. This implies that much of the presumably endemic degradation in the Succulent Karoo Biome is not evident in the Tankwa.

TI  - FIRST ORDER CATCHMENTS MORPHOMETRICS IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS UNDER NO-TILL FARMING: DELINEATION AND PRONENESS TO FLOODING AND RAINFALL EROSION
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - No-till farming (NTF) uses agricultural techniques for soil conservation, controlling erosion processes. For this, it is necessary to know the characteristics of the relief that affect the dynamics and the erosive power of the water in the catchment where NTF is adopted. The study aimed to adapt a methodology for the delineation of 12 catchments of about 1 km(2) under NTF from digital terrain (DTMs) and elevation models (DEMs). Four morphometric indices related to the water dynamics and erosive power in the catchment were calculated, including: slope gradient, compactness coefficient (CC), circularity index (CI) and form factor (FF). To delineate the catchments, it was necessary to combine data from different sources and spatial resolutions (Pleiades and Ultracam D DTMs, and ALOS Palsar and SRTM DEMs), and ArcSWAT was used. MBH were distributed in the states: SP, GO, MS, RS and PR. In agreement with the slope values, the Sarandi and Coxilha catchments are the most prone to erosion, while the Maracaju 1 and Itai 1 are the least ones. According to the CC, CI and FF indices, the Toledo 2 and Coxilha catchments are the most prone to flooding, and the Maracaju 1 and 2 and Itai 1 catchments are the least ones. The applied methodology was successfully adapted for the delineation of first-order catchments. Furthermore, the calculated morphometric indices will subsidize the NTF management, allowing to adopt erosion control measures, reducing impacts of soil and nutrient loss in these agricultural areas.

TI  - Computation of City-descriptive Parameters for High-resolution Numerical Weather Prediction in Moscow Megacity in the Framework of the COSMO Model
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new methodology is proposed for computing the city-descriptive parameters for the TERRA_URB scheme in the COSMO model. It is based on the GIS analysis of OpenStreetMap data, Sentinel-2 satellite images, and global land cover data. A set of parameters is obtained for Moscow megacity on a grid with the spacing of 500 m. The dataset is promising for high-resolution numerical weather prediction within the COSMO-Ru system and for urban climate research.

TI  - Analyzing Links between Spatio-Temporal Metrics of Built-Up Areas and Socio-Economic Indicators on a Semi-Global Scale
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Manifold socio-economic processes shape the built and natural elements in urban areas. They thus influence both the living environment of urban dwellers and sustainability in many dimensions. Monitoring the development of the urban fabric and its relationships with socio-economic and environmental processes will help to elucidate their linkages and, thus, aid in the development of new strategies for more sustainable development. In this study, we identified empirical and significant relationships between income, inequality, GDP, air pollution and employment indicators and their change over time with the spatial organization of the built and natural elements in functional urban areas. We were able to demonstrate this in 32 countries using spatio-temporal metrics, using geoinformation from databases available worldwide. We employed random forest regression, and we were able to explain 32% to 68% of the variability of socio-economic variables. This confirms that spatial patterns and their change are linked to socio-economic indicators. We also identified the spatio-temporal metrics that were more relevant in the models: we found that urban compactness, concentration degree, the dispersion index, the densification of built-up growth, accessibility and land-use/land-cover density and change could be used as proxies for some socio-economic indicators. This study is a first and fundamental step for the identification of such relationships at a global scale. The proposed methodology is highly versatile, the inclusion of new datasets is straightforward, and the increasing availability of multi-temporal geospatial and socio-economic databases is expected to empirically boost the study of these relationships from a multi-temporal perspective in the near future.

TI  - Comparison of the Sentinel-1B Synthetic Aperture Radar With Airborne Microwave Sensors in an Extra-Tropical Cyclone
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Winter 2017, the University of Massachusetts Amherst's Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler (IWRAP) was flown on a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WP-3D Hurricane Hunter aircraft under the direction of scientists from Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) at NOAA/National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) over the North Atlantic ocean out of Shannon, Ireland. IWRAP is a dual-frequency, conically scanning, profiling Doppler radar initially developed by Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory (MIRSL) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst that is routinely installed on the NOAA WP-3D research aircraft. The flight on February 6, 2017, targeted a region of high winds (greater than 30 m/s) that was also observed by the Sentinel-1B satellite's synthetic aperture radar. Sentinel-1B was configured to observe in extended wide swath mode in both VV- and VH-polarizations, whereas the IWRAP C-band radar was configured to measure all of VV-, VH-, and HH-polarizations. IWRAP and Sentinel-1B VV and VH normalized radar cross section (NRCS) at the same Earthincidence angle along the flight path match reasonably well during the entire flight, but some additional trends between aircraft and satellite can be observed. IWRAP VV-polarized NRCS generally match the CMOD5.h geophysical model function (GMF), suggesting errors in the Sentinel-1B processing chain.

TI  - Seasonal variation of oxidative biomarkers in gills and digestive glands of the clam <i>Anomalocardia flexuosa</i> and the mangrove oyster <i>Crassostrea rhizophorae</i>
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - We determined values of antioxidant biomarkers catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in two bivalve species from a subtropical system in Brazil. Differences in the biomarkers activities measured in digestive glands and gills sampled at two seasons and in sites with different levels of contamination were tested using univariate and multivariate analyses. Seasonality was the main factor accounting for overall variability. Significant SOD and GPx activities and increased levels of lipid peroxides were detected in summer, while CAT activity was higher in winter. However, biomarkers respond to complex environmental settings as indicated by the significant interaction between season and contamination level. We propose A. flexuosa as a candidate for monitoring studies with sampling occurring at a yearly timescale, and using C. rhizophorae is better suited for designs that include both seasons.

TI  - Prediction of the Kiwifruit Decline Syndrome in Diseased Orchards by Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eight years after the first record in Italy, Kiwifruit Decline (KD), a destructive disease causing root rot, has already affected more than 25% of the area under kiwifruit cultivation in Italy. Diseased plants are characterised by severe decay of the fine roots and sudden wilting of the canopy, which is only visible after the season's first period of heat (July-August). The swiftness of symptom appearance prevents correct timing and positioning for sampling of the disease, and is therefore a barrier to aetiological studies. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of thermal and multispectral imaging for the detection of KD using an unsupervised classifier. Thus, RGB, multispectral and thermal data from a kiwifruit orchard, with healthy and diseased plants, were acquired simultaneously during two consecutive growing seasons (2017-2018) using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform. Data reduction was applied to the clipped areas of the multispectral and thermal data from the 2017 survey. Reduced data were then classified with two unsupervised algorithms, a K-means and a hierarchical method. The plant vigour (canopy size and presence/absence of wilted leaves) and the health shifts exhibited by asymptomatic plants between 2017 and 2018 were evaluated from RGB data via expert assessment and used as the ground truth for cluster interpretation. Multispectral data showed a high correlation with plant vigour, while temperature data demonstrated a good potential use in predicting health shifts, especially in highly vigorous plants that were asymptomatic in 2017 and became symptomatic in 2018. The accuracy of plant vigour assessment was above 73% when using multispectral data, while clustering of the temperature data allowed the prediction of disease outbreak one year in advance, with an accuracy of 71%. Based on our results, the unsupervised clustering of remote sensing data could be a reliable tool for the identification of sampling areas, and can greatly improve aetiological studies of this new disease in kiwifruit.

AB  - The purpose of this article is the historical and philosophical reconstruction of phenomenological tradition in Russian philosophy of the late XIX - first half of the XX century; to reveal its epistemological specifics. We disclose the issue of phenomenological philosophy in Russia, its significant influence was rendered by immanentism and organicism. According to our hypothesis, it is the organic understanding of the world that becomes the main idea of the new philosophical worldview in XX century. The organic understanding of the world was inherent in the most prominent representatives of Russian philosophy such as N.E. Lossky and S.L. Frank, as well as the neo-Kantian S. Hesse. It is largely determined by their egotological perception.

TI  - Improving on MODIS MCD64A1 Burned Area Estimates in Grassland Systems: A Case Study in Kansas Flint Hills Tall Grass Prairie
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainty in satellite-derived burned area estimates are especially high in grassland systems, which are some of the most frequently burned ecosystems in the world. In this study, we compare differences in predicted burned area estimates for a region with the highest fire activity in North America, the Flint Hills of Kansas, USA, using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD64A1 burned area product and a customization of the MODIS MCD64A1 product using a major ground-truthing effort by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE-MODIS customization). Local-scale ground-truthing and the KDHE-MODIS product suggests MODIS burned area estimates under predicted fire occurrence by 28% over a 19-year period in the Flint Hills ecoregion. Between 2001 and 2019, MODIS product indicated <1 million acres burned on average, which was far below the KDHE-MODIS customization (mean = 2.6 million acres). MODIS also showed that <1% of the Flint Hills burned 5 times from 2001-2019 (2001, 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2013), whereas KDHE-MODIS customization showed this never happened in any single year. KDHE-MODIS also captured some areas of the Flint Hills that burned every year (19 times out of 19 years), which is well-known with field inventory data, whereas the maximum fire occurrence in MODIS was 14 times in 19 years. Finally, MODIS never captured >8% burned area for any given year in the Flint Hills, even in years when fire activity was highest (2008, 2009, 2011, 2014). Based on these results, coupling MODIS burned area computations with local scale ground-truth efforts has the potential to significantly improve fire occurrence estimates and reduce uncertainty in other grassland and savanna regions.

TI  - Implementing genuine participatory action research with Aboriginal Elders: The Ngulluk Koolunga Ngulluk Koort project
T2  - ACTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the processes involved in establishing a genuinely collaborative and participatory role for nine Aboriginal Elders in a five-year participatory action research project focused on early child development in the Perth metropolitan area of Western Australia. The project goals are to better inform and align policy and program design with Aboriginal values, world views and concepts of childhood. The Elder's authority in the design, conduct and outputs of the research are intended to adhere to a decolonising approach, whereby Aboriginal people have power and voice in ways that are aligned to their values and beliefs. Requirements for research that is collaborative, relational, participatory and reflexive are not straightforward or easily achieved, and the process of working with the nine Elders in their roles as Co-researchers has not been without its challenges. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities of working with Aboriginal Elders as Co-researchers and seeks to enhance understanding of the necessity of incorporating an Aboriginal worldview and knowledge framework in this way.

Cross-cultural interaction is interpreted within the framework of mastering linguocultural communication codes and the worldview of allophones. The analysis of factual data is based on the linguosemiotic approach to its interpretation within a discursive utterance. The level of the relevant content of an utterance is interpreted as essential for defining the characterological traits of communication.

TI  - Estimating Wheat Grain Yield Using Sentinel-2 Imagery and Exploring Topographic Features and Rainfall Effects on Wheat Performance in Navarre, Spain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable methods for estimating wheat grain yield before harvest could help improve farm management and, if applied on a regional level, also help identify spatial factors that influence yield. Regional grain yield can be estimated using conventional methods, but the typical process is complex and labor-intensive. Here we describe the development of a streamlined approach using publicly accessible agricultural data, field-level yield, and remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 satellite to estimate regional wheat grain yield. We validated our method on wheat croplands in Navarre in northern Spain, which features heterogeneous topography and rainfall. First, this study developed stepwise multilinear equations to estimate grain yield based on various vegetation indices, which were measured at various phenological stages in order to determine the optimal timings. Second, the most suitable model was used to estimate grain yield in wheat parcels mapped from Sentinel-2 satellite images. We used a supervised pixel-based random forest classification and the estimates were compared to government-published post-harvest yield statistics. When tested, the model achieved an R(2)of 0.83 in predicting grain yield at field level. The wheat parcels were mapped with an accuracy close to 86% for both overall accuracy and compared to official statistics. Third, the validated model was used to explore potential relationships of the mapped per-parcel grain yield estimation with topographic features and rainfall by using geographically weighted regressions. Topographic features and rainfall together accounted for an average for 11 to 20% of the observed spatial variation in grain yield in Navarre. These results highlight the ability of our method for estimating wheat grain yield before harvest and determining spatial factors that influence yield at the regional scale.

AB  - Optical remote sensing has limitations in obtaining images due to weather and environmental effects, so these limitations must be overcome to produce time-series image data. As an alternative to this, research are being conducted to simulate images at a specific time for which a specific image is needed. The purpose of this study is to improve the results of this process by preprocessing the input images of a multiple linear regression model alongside other remote sensing image simulation methods. Specifically, the input images, which are applied to a multi-linear regression equation, are preprocessed for phenological and radiometric normalization by a random forest regression model. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the conventional methods both visually and quantitatively.

TI  - Fusion of Multi-Satellite Data and Artificial Neural Network for Predicting Total Discharge
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As research on the use of satellites in combination with previous hydrological monitoring techniques increases, interest in the application of the machine-learning approach to the prediction of hydrological variables is growing. Ground-based measurements are often limited due to the difficulties in measuring spatiotemporal variations, especially in ungauged areas. In addition, there are no existing satellites capable of measuring total discharge directly. In this study, Artificial neural network (ANN) machine-learning approaches are examined for the prediction of 0.25 degrees total discharge data over the Korean Peninsula using the data fusion of multi-satellites, reanalysis data, and ground-based observations. Terrestrial water storage changes (TWSC) of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite, precipitation of the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM), and soil moisture storage and average temperature of the global land data assimilation system (GLDAS) models are used as ANN model input data. The results demonstrate the relatively good performance of the ANN approach for predicting the total discharge in terms of the correlation coefficient (r= 0.65-0.95), maximum absolute error (MAE = 13.28-20.35 mm/month), root mean square error (RMSE = 22.56-34.77 mm/month), and Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE = 0.42-0.90). The precipitation is identified as the most influential input parameter through a sensitivity analysis. Overall, the ANN-predicted total discharge shows similar spatial patterns to those from other methods, while GLDAS underestimates the total discharge with a smaller dynamic range than the other models. Thus, the potential of the ANN approach described herein shows promise for predicting the total discharge based on the data fusion of multi-satellites, reanalysis data, and ground-based observations.

TI  - Evaluation of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and Remote Sensing (RS) for Estimating Pasture Quality in Mediterranean Montado Ecosystem
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application The inter-annual variability of rainfall distribution in the Mediterranean region has an important impact on the vegetative cycle of dryland pastures and, consequently, on the availability of animal feed in extensive regime. The results of this study show the practical interest of spectrometry and of remote sensing as expeditious tools for monitoring pasture quality and support farm management decisions in terms of animal supplementation needs in the critical periods. Pasture quality monitoring is a key element in the decision making process of a farm manager. Laboratory reference methods for assessing quality parameters such as crude protein (CP) or fibers (neutral detergent fiber: NDF) require collection and analytical procedures involving technicians, time, and reagents, making them laborious and expensive. The objective of this work was to evaluate two technological and expeditious approaches for estimating and monitoring the evolution of the quality parameters in biodiverse Mediterranean pastures: (i) near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with multivariate data analysis and (ii) remote sensing (RS) based on Sentinel-2 imagery to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI). Between February 2018 and March 2019, 21 sampling processes were carried out in nine fields, totaling 398 pasture samples, of which 315 were used during the calibration phase and 83 were used during the validation phase of the NIRS approach. The average reference values of pasture moisture content (PMC), CP, and NDF, obtained in 24 tests carried out between January and May 2019 in eight fields, were used to evaluate the RS accuracy. The results of this study showed significant correlation between NIRS calibration models or spectral indices obtained by remote sensing (NDVI(RS)and NDWIRS) and reference methods for quantifying pasture quality parameters, both of which open up good prospects for technological-based service providers to develop applications that enable the dynamic management of animal grazing.

TI  - Mosquito Species Composition and Abundance in Quebec, Eastern Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Given current and projected changes in the climate, the composition of mosquito species is predicted to shift geographically with implications for the transmission dynamics of vector-borne pathogens. Many mosquito species are rarely collected in Canada and their history is poorly understood; thus assessing their potential role as vectors for pathogenesis is difficult. Mosquitoes were collected from four trapping sites in Quebec Province, Canada, from June to September during 2018 and 2019 using BG sentinel traps. From all morphologically identified female mosquitoes, at least one specimen was selected for identification confirmation using the DNA-barcoding technique. Sequences were subjected to alignment and a Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree was created using Geneious software. In total, 2,752 female mosquitoes belonging to 20 species over five genera: including Aedes (Ae.), Anopheles (An.), Culex (Cx.), Culiseta (Cu.), Coquillettidia (Cq.) were collected.The predominant mosquito was found to be Ae. cinereus. The highest number of mosquito species was captured in July, followed by August, September, and then June. Five genera were characterized by a distinctive set of cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences that formed well-supported clusters in the NJ-tree.The presence of Ae. japonicus in Quebec provides an initial look at the distribution of mosquito species in eastern Canada, which may put Canadians at risk of a wider range of arboviruses.

TI  - Assessment of Four Near-Surface Soil Freeze/Thaw Detection Algorithms Based on Calibrated Passive Microwave Remote Sensing Data Over China
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The near-surface soil freeze/thaw (F/T) cycle affects the surface energy balance, hydrological processes, and soil greenhouse gas release. Passive microwave remote sensing data are the most widely used method for determining the near-surface soil F/T status. While many algorithms have been developed for this purpose, their performance has never been compared using same and large in situ data set. Here, we evaluate and inter-compare the classification results of the four most widely used algorithms using a large ground truth data set covering China. Based on the ground observations, our evaluation shows a wide range of near-surface soil F/T detection performance, with Cohen's kappa coefficient ranging from 0.42 to 0.72 and an overall accuracy between 73.8% and 86.2%. We suggest performing parameter calibration for the decision tree algorithm and the discriminant function algorithm before applying them to areas outside of the training sites. All these four algorithms exhibited remarkable uncertainty in the detection of the onset and offset of near-surface soil freezing with root mean squared errors of more than 27 days. These results suggest that careful cautions should be taken when outputs of these algorithms are used for investigations of long-term changes.

TI  - Exploring the Relationship between Urbanization and Ecological Environment Using Remote Sensing Images and Statistical Data: A Case Study in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid urban development in China, urbanization has brought more and more pressure on the ecological environment. As one of the most dynamic, open, and innovative regions in China, the eco-environmental issues in the Yangtze River Delta have attracted much attention. This paper takes the central region of the Yangtze River Delta as the research object, through building the index system of urbanization and ecological environment based on statistical data and two new indicators (fraction of vegetation coverage and surface urban heat island intensity) extracted from remote sensing images, uses the Entropy-TOPSIS method to complete the comprehensive assessment, and then analyzes the coupling coordination degree between the urbanization and ecological environment and main obstacle factors. The results showed that the coupling coordination degree in the study region generally shows an upward trend from 0.604 in 2008 to 0.753 in 2017, generally changing from an imbalanced state towards a basically balanced state. However, regional imbalance of urbanization and ecological environment always exists, which is mainly affected by social urbanization, economic urbanization, landscape urbanization, pollution loading and resource consumption. Finally, on the basis of the obstacle factor analysis, some specific suggestions for promoting the coordinated development of the Yangtze River Delta are put forward.

TI  - SEMANTIC POTENTIAL OF SOUNDS IN COSTUME OF NATIONS OF ANCIENT MIDDLE EAST
T2  - REVISTA INCLUSIONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sounding elements in the costume of the nationalities of the Ancient Middle East are researched in the paper. The urgency of the topic is conditioned by the pendency of the number of problems in the field of genesis and functioning of sounding elements in the costume, as well as by the absence of anintegral, systemic idea about the phenomenon of sounding ornaments, having preserved the semantics of the worldview, ideaofanentity as an integrity being a part of the culture. The objective of the paper consists in definition of the semantic potential of sounding ornaments in the costume of the nationalities of the Ancient Middle East. The sound semantics is considered in close connection with formation of value ideas of society about the surrounding world and the role of a human being in it. The attempt to trace the interconnection of the use of a sound code in the costume is undertaken along with the definition of specific peculiarities of particular culture, characteristic features of the mentality, life attitudes of the representatives of this or that socium. In the study of this problem, the leading approaches are systemic and information-semiotic ones.

TI  - Spatio-temporal trends in the surface ice velocities of the central Himalayan glaciers, India
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The glacier surface ice velocity (SIV) is important in understanding the glacier state. This study presents results on the SIV of the 18 glaciers spread over the Indian central Himalaya (ICH). The SIV was computed by applying Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation (COSI-Corr) technique on the Landsat time series data (1993-2017). Results show that the average SIV of all glaciers was 22.63 +/- 5.8 m a(-1) in 1993/94, which decreased (by similar to 23%) to 17.32 +/- 3.1 m a(-1) in 2000/01 and further declined (by similar to 33%) to 11.50 +/- 1.7 m a(-1) in 2015/16. Though a secular decline in average SIV is observed, rates of slowdown are considerably heterogeneous for the studied glaciers being largely determined by glaciers size, orientation, altitude and debris cover. Slope was found to have comparatively low influence on the glacier movement. Inter-regional comparison reveals that average SIVs of the ICH glaciers were slightly but consistently lower than that of the western and eastern Himalayan glaciers. Nonetheless, though moving slowly, ICH glaciers are more active than nearby Everest region glaciers with sufficient proportion of active glaciers (referred as Type-I; 39%). However, the point of concern is that owing to declining health, ICH-glaciers are progressively converting from Type-I to partially active (referred as Type-II), and Type-II to entirely stagnant (referred as Type-III). This observed slowdown coupled with negative mass balance and continuous debris growth (as reported in previous studies) may form favorable conditions for supraglacial lake development. We thereby recommend regular monitoring of glacier dynamics in this region for tenable assessment of climatic change impacts.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Moisture Applying Modified Dubois Model to Sentinel-1; A Regional Study from Central India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture has a wide application in climate change, agronomy, water resources, and in many other domain of science and engineering. Measurement of soil moisture at high spatial and temporal resolution at regional and global scale is needed for the prediction of flood, drought, planning and management of agricultural productivity to ensure food security. Recent advancement in microwave remote sensing, especially after the launch of Sentinel operational satellites has enabled the scientific community to estimate soil moisture at higher spatial and temporal resolution with greater accuracy. This study evaluates the potential of Sentinel-1A satellite images to estimate soil moisture in a semi-arid region. Exactly at the time when satellite passes over the study area, we have collected soil samples at 37 different locations and measured the soil moisture from 5 cm below the ground surface using ML3 theta probe. We processed the soil samples in laboratory to obtain volumetric soil moisture using the oven dry method. We found soil moisture measured from calibrated theta probe and oven dry method are in good agreement with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 0.025 m3/m3and coefficient of determination (R2) 0.85. We then processed Sentinel-1A images and applied modified Dubois model to calculate relative permittivity of the soil from the backscatter values (sigma degrees). The volumetric soil moisture at each pixel is then calculated by applying the universal Topp's model. Finally, we masked the pixels whose Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) value is greater than 0.4 to generate soil moisture map as per the Dubois NDVI criterion. Our modelled soil moisture accord with the measured values with RMSE = 0.035 and R-2= 0.75. We found a small bias in the modelled soil moisture (0.02m(3)/m(3)). However, this has reduced significantly (0.001m(3)/m(3)) after applying a bias correction based on Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) matching. Our approach provides a first-order estimate of soil moisture from Sentinel-1A images in sparsely vegetated agricultural land.

TI  - The Problem of Mismatch between the CORINE Land Cover Data Classification and the Development of Settlement in Poland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of the article is the evaluation of usefulness of CORINE Land Cover (CLC) data-acquired predominantly by visual interpretation of Landsat satellite imagery-for monitoring of changes in settlement development and land use. This has been done by comparison of occurrence of buildings (and address points) in Poland with delimitations of land use belonging to particular classes in the CLC 2018 dataset. Large discrepancies have been identified, which reach on average approx. 34% of addresses and 35% of buildings located outside class 1 (artificial surfaces), mainly on terrains of class 2 (agricultural areas). Among single-family buildings it was 37% and among new addresses (forecasted or "under construction" buildings)-as much as 50%. This puts a question mark over the possibility of using CLC data with a resolution of 25 ha for monitoring of spatial planning and development in Poland for purposes of the diagnosis and assessment of the scale of dispersion of built-up areas. It is worth carrying out similar analyses in other countries, known for the deconcentration processes and a relatively large share of dispersed settlement, e.g., other CEE countries, Spain, Portugal, Italy.

TI  - Influenza With and Without Fever: Clinical Predictors and Impact on Outcomes in Patients Requiring Hospitalization
T2  - OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The Infectious Diseases Society of America influenza guidelines no longer require fever as part of their influenza case definition in patients requiring hospitalization. However, the impact of fever or lack of fever on clinical decision-making and patient outcomes has not been studied.Methods. We conducted a retrospective review of adult patients admitted to our tertiary health service between April 2016 and June 2019 with laboratory-confirmed influenza, with and without fever (>= 37.8 degrees C). Patient demographics, presenting features, and outcomes were analyzed using Pearson's chi-square test, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and logistic regression.Results. Of 578 influenza inpatients, 219 (37.9%) had no fever at presentation. Fever was less likely in individuals with a nonrespiratory syndrome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.77), symptoms for >= 3 days (aOR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36-0.78), influenza B infection (aOR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.29-0.70), chronic lung disease (aOR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.81), age >= 65 (aOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.23-0.54), and female sex (aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.48-0.99). Patients without fever had lower rates of testing for influenza in the emergency department (64.8% vs 77.2%; P = .002) and longer inpatient stays (median, 2.4 vs 1.9 days; P = .015). These patients were less likely to receive antiviral treatment (55.7% vs 65.6%; P = .024) and more likely die in the hospital (3.2% vs 0.6%; P = .031), and these differences persisted after adjustment for potential confounders.Conclusions. Absence of fever in influenza is associated with delayed diagnosis, longer length of stay, and higher mortality.

TI  - Improved Severe Weather Forecasts Using LEO and GEO Satellite Soundings
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is shown here that improvements in numerical weather prediction (NWP) model forecasts of hazardous weather can be obtained by assimilating profile retrievals obtained in real time from combined direct broadcast system (DBS) polar satellite hyperspectral and geostationary satellite multispectral radiance data. Results of NWP model forecasts are shown for two recent tornado outbreak cases: 1) the 3 March 2019 tornado outbreak over the southeast United States and 2) the tornado outbreak that occurred across Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio during the night of 27 May and the morning of 28 May 2019, and 3) the 4 March 2019 severe precipitation event that occurred in southeast China. Improvements in both quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) and predictions of the location of tornado occurrence are obtained. It is also shown that geostationary satellite hyperspectral soundings [i.e., Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) Geosynchronous Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS)] further improve hazardous precipitation forecasts when used, in addition to the combined polar hyperspectral and geostationary multispectral satellite profile data, to initialize the numerical forecast model. The lowest false alarm rate (FAR) and the highest probability of detection (POD) and critical success index (CSI) scores are achieved when assimilating atmospheric profile retrievals obtained by combining all the available satellite high-vertical-resolution hyperspectral radiance measurements with geostationary satellite high-spatial-resolution and high-temporal-resolution multispectral radiance measurements.

TI  - Distribution behaviour in body compartments and <i>in ovo</i> transfer of flame retardants in North American Great Lakes herring gulls
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and other halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) continue to be an environmental concern. In the Laurentian Great Lakes, herring gulls (Larus argentatus) are an important wildlife sentinel species, although very little information is available regarding the body distribution (limited to e.g. liver and blood) of these contaminants and in relation to depuration via in ovo transfer. Maternal transfer rates and distribution were presently determined in six body compartments from eight female, Great Lakes herring gulls and separate egg compartments from their entire clutch. Among the 25 PBDEs and 23 non-PBDE HFRs assessed, only six PBDE congeners (BDE-47/99/100/153/154/209), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), and Dechlorane Plus (syn- and anti-DDC-CO) were frequently detectable and quantifiable. Sigma 6BDE concentrations were an order of magnitude greater than non-PBDE HFR concentrations, and were greatest in the adipose (9641 +/- 2436 ng/g ww), followed by egg yolk (699 +/- 139 ng/g ww) > muscle (332 +/- 545 ng/g ww) > liver (221 +/- 65 ng/g ww) > plasma (85.4 +/- 20.4 ng/g ww) > brain (54.6 +/- 10.6 ng/g ww) > red blood cells (RBCs; 23.5 +/- 5.6 ng/g ww) > albumen (7.3 +/- 1.3 ng/g ww). Sigma 2DDC-CO and HBCDD were frequently below the method limit of quantification in the brain, RBCs, plasma, and albumen. Additionally, novel methoxylated-polybrominated diphenoxybenzene contaminants were detected and quantified in herring gull tissues and eggs. The primary difference in PBDE congener profiles was the resistance of both BDE-153 and -154 towards accumulation in the brain, and a corresponding increase in BDE-209 accumulation, which may suggest congener-specific differences in crossing the blood-brain barrier in herring gulls. Maternal transfer rates of PBDEs and non-PBDE HFRs were low (similar to 4.7 and similar to 2.9 % respectively), suggesting that in ovo transfer is not a significant mode of depuration for these compounds.

TI  - Near real-time estimation of Sea and Land surface temperature for MSG SEVIRI sensors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land and Sea Surface Temperatures (LST and SST) are both recognized as Essential Climate Variables, and are routinely retrieved by a wealth of satellites. However, for validated approaches, the latest data are usually not available to the general public. We offer to bridge this gap, by using Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI), with its 15 min temporal resolution. Here, we present generic algorithms for the retrieval of both LST and SST, valid for the SEVIRI instrument onboard MSG platforms 8-11, which we validate using hourly data of 4 ground stations and 11 buoys in Spain over the years 2015 to 2018. These validations show that in the best conditions of surface homogeneity (cloud-free summer nights), errors in our LST estimation are below 1.5 K for stations with good thermal homogeneity. Comparison with LSA-SAF (Land Surface Analysis - Satellite Application Facility) LST shows differences below 2 K for most of SEVIRI disk, with higher differences in arid areas and during daytime. As for SST retrieval, the average error amount to 0.67 K for cloud-free buoy data. These algorithms have been implemented in a near-real time processing chain, which provide actualized LST and SST maps every 15 min within 5 min of image reception. These maps, along with other products, can be freely consulted from a dedicated webpage (https://www.uv.es/iplsat).

TI  - Ozone trends on equatorial and tropical regions of South America using Dobson spectrophotometer, TOMS and OMI satellites instruments
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ozone layer filters solar ultraviolet radiation and is affected by several photochemical and dynamical processes in the atmosphere. Stratospheric ozone formation takes place primarily in tropical regions and it is the consequence of reactions between atmospheric oxygen and the ultraviolet solar radiation. For the purpose of this paper, the atmospheric TOC (Total Ozone Content) measurements are calculated using Dobson spectrophotometers, in conjunction of satellite data of TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer), and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument), at Cachoeira Paulista (22.7 degrees S, 45.0 degrees W) (CP) and Natal (5.8 degrees S, 35.2 degrees W) (NT), Brazil. The time series considered extend from 1974 to 2013 for CP and from 1978 to 2013 for NT. The mean differences in ozone values between Dobson and TOMS, and between Dobson and OMI, are about 3% and 2%, respectively. The correlations of the Dobson spectrophotometers with TOMS are inferior to the correlations of Dobson to OMI data, due to the improved retrieval and algorithm of the more recent OMI instrument. The observed long-term ozone trends obtained for CP and NT with Dobsons, are: -2.76%, for the period of 1974-2013, and -0.78%, for the period of 1978-2013, respectively. The trend in TOC per decade is of -0.71 +/- 0.4% at CP, and of -0.22 +/- 0.2%, at NT. The estimated seasonal trends for CP in June-July-August are -3.3%, compared to NT, which yields -1% in the same period. NT seasonal trend for December-January-February is -1.3%. This shows that there is a more significant decrease at CP than at NT, which agrees with the fact that the most active ozone production occurs near the equator. The average ozone amounts were 268.3 +/- 13.1 DU for CP and 265.9 +/- 10.9 DU for NT, and a seasonal cycle with a minimum of 256.0 DU at CP and NT in autumn and maximum of 283 DU at CP and 279 DU at NT in spring, of southern hemisphere.

TI  - A community of captured Ukrainian soldiers of the tsarist army in the Wetzlar camp, Germany (September 1915 - November 1916): according to the materials of TsDAVO of Ukraine
T2  - EMINAK
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the specifics of the functioning of the community of captured Ukrainians in the Wetzlar camp (Germany), September 1915 - December 1916, to cover which the authors used a large array of documents stored in the Central State Archives of Supreme Authorities' and Administration of Ukraine.The urgency of the study of this problem is primarily due to the need for a balanced and objective study of the history of the camp Wetzlar, which housed about 16 thousand captured Ukrainians from the tsarist army, as well as the importance of introducing into wide scientific circulation an array of new archival sources on this issue.The aim of the article is a comprehensive analysis of the daily camp of Ukrainian soldiers of the tsarist army in Wetzlar (Germany) - from the beginning of its Ukrainization (September 1915), and to the delegation to the elected bodies of the Ukrainian camp community of the functions of managing the entire internal life of the prisoners in this camp (November 1916). The objectives of the article are to analyze the organizational and creative efforts of the members of the Union for the Liberation of Ukraine, who pursued the goal of nationally informing the prisoners, and involving them in the work of Ukrainian groups and organizations - to instil in them the basics of the state worldview.Conclusions. The beginnings of organized Ukrainian life in the camp were marked by great difficulties due to the opposition of the Black Hundreds, but thanks to the persistent efforts of the members of the Educational Department of the Union for the Liberation of Ukraine and the active prisoners in Wetzlar, several circles and institutions were created (folk theatre, choir, orchestra, folk school, cooperative, etc.).Over time, the groups increased their number, in addition - all this time the activities of the Education Department and the commandant's office removed the anti-Ukrainian element from the camp, which in turn expanded the field for national and organizational work. The Ukrainian asset of the camp, united in several societies, increasingly took over the management of various areas of cultural and educational work.The social and organizational life of the campers was also quite developed - already in the spring of 1916 a number of societies headed by elected presidiums from among the prisoners operated in the camp. In Wetzlar, general camp central representations were established - the << General Council >> and the << General Sergeant >> of the camp, which allowed to unite the work of all institutions and strengthen their influence on prisoners. The camp organizations kept in touch with the work teams, sending << men of trust >> to them with fresh copies of newspapers and books.In the autumn of 1916, important changes took place in the life of the Ukrainian camp community, which were connected with the dissolution of the Education Department and the transfer of all the levers of management of intra-camp life to the elected representation of Ukrainian prisoners. This was a turning point in the history of the camp, testifying to the high degree of national consciousness of Ukrainian soldiers and their self-organization. Since then, the Ukrainian community has become a completely self-governing structure, the leadership of which independently regulated the internal life and way of life of the campers, turning in case of need to the German commandant's office of the camp.Prospects for further research are seen in the preparation of the synthetic history of the Wetzlar camp.

TI  - Deep Learning with Open Data for Desert Road Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of free and open data from Earth observation programmes such as Copernicus, and from collaborative projects such as Open Street Map (OSM), enables low cost artificial intelligence (AI) based monitoring applications. This creates opportunities, particularly in developing countries with scarce economic resources, for large-scale monitoring in remote regions. A significant portion of Earth's surface comprises desert dune fields, where shifting sand affects infrastructure and hinders movement. A robust, cost-effective and scalable methodology is proposed for road detection and monitoring in regions covered by desert sand. The technique uses Copernicus Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data as an input to a deep learning model based on the U-Net architecture for image segmentation. OSM data is used for model training. The method comprises two steps: The first involves processing time series of Sentinel-1 SAR interferometric wide swath (IW) acquisitions in the same geometry to produce multitemporal backscatter and coherence averages. These are divided into patches and matched with masks of OSM roads to form the training data, the quantity of which is increased through data augmentation. The second step includes the U-Net deep learning workflow. The methodology has been applied to three different dune fields in Africa and Asia. A performance evaluation through the calculation of the Jaccard similarity coefficient was carried out for each area, and ranges from 84% to 89% for the best available input. The rank distance, calculated from the completeness and correctness percentages, was also calculated and ranged from 75% to 80%. Over all areas there are more missed detections than false positives. In some cases, this was due to mixed infrastructure in the same resolution cell of the input SAR data. Drift sand and dune migration covering infrastructure is a concern in many desert regions, and broken segments in the resulting road detections are sometimes due to sand burial. The results also show that, in most cases, the Sentinel-1 vertical transmit-vertical receive (VV) backscatter averages alone constitute the best input to the U-Net model. The detection and monitoring of roads in desert areas are key concerns, particularly given a growing population increasingly on the move.

TI  - Comparative Assessment of the Built-Up Area Expansion Based on Corine Land Cover and Landsat Datasets: A Case Study of a Post-Socialist City
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring uncontained built-up area expansion remains a complex challenge for the development and implementation of a sustainable planning system. In this regard, proper planning requires accurate monitoring tools and up-to-date information on rapid territorial transformations. The purpose of the study was to assess built-up area expansion, comparing two freely available and widely used datasets, respectively, Corine Land Cover and Landsat, to each other, as well as the ground truth, with the goal of identifying the most cost-effective and reliable tool. The analysis was based on the largest post-socialist city in the European Union, the capital of Romania, Bucharest, and its neighboring Ilfov County, from 1990 to 2018. This study generally represents a new approach to measuring the process of urban expansion, offering insights about the strengths and limitations of the two datasets through a multi-level territorial perspective. The results point out discrepancies between the datasets, both at the macro-scale level and at the administrative unit's level. On the macro-scale level, despite the noticeable differences, the two datasets revealed the spatiotemporal magnitude of the expansion of the built-up area and can be a useful tool for supporting the decision-making process. On the smaller territorial scale, detailed comparative analyses through five case-studies were conducted, indicating that, if used alone, limitations on the information that can be derived from the datasets would lead to inaccuracies, thus significantly limiting their potential to be used in the development of enforceable regulation in urban planning.

TI  - OPEN: A New Estimation of Global Ocean Heat Content for Upper 2000 Meters from Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieving information concerning the interior of the ocean using satellite remote sensing data has a major impact on studies of ocean dynamic and climate changes; however, the lack of information within the ocean limits such studies about the global ocean. In this paper, an artificial neural network, combined with satellite data and gridded Argo product, is used to estimate the ocean heat content (OHC) anomalies over four different depths down to 2000 m covering the near-global ocean, excluding the polar regions. Our method allows for the temporal hindcast of the OHC to other periods beyond the 2005-2018 training period. By applying an ensemble technique, the hindcasting uncertainty could also be estimated by using different 9-year periods for training and then calculating the standard deviation across six ensemble members. This new OHC product is called the Ocean Projection and Extension neural Network (OPEN) product. The accuracy of the product is accessed using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE). The feature combinations and network architecture are optimized via a series of experiments. Overall, intercomparison with several routinely analyzed OHC products shows that the OPEN OHC has an R(2)larger than 0.95 and an RRMSE of <0.20 and presents notably accurate trends and variabilities. The OPEN product can therefore provide a valuable complement for studies of global climate changes.

TI  - Is it Wise to Omit Sentinel Node Biopsy in Elderly Patients with Breast Cancer?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The Society of Surgical Oncology's Choosing Wisely (R) guidelines recommend against routine sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in clinically node-negative (cN0), hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer patients aged >= 70 years. We examined the effect of SLNB on treatment and outcomes in this population.Materials and Methods. A single-institution retrospective review of consecutive cN0 women >= 70 years of age who received SLNB was performed. We collected clinicopathologic characteristics and treatment data. Patients were compared according to SLN status with subset analysis of HR-positive patients. Outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and univariable analysis, and were compared using log-rank tests.Results. Of 500 patients, 345 (69%) were SLN-negative. Median age was 74 years (range 70-96). Most tumors were T1 (72%), N0 (69%), invasive ductal (77%), without lymphovascular invasion (88%), estrogen receptor-positive (88%) and progesterone receptor-positive (75%), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (88%) treated with lumpectomy (71%). Median number of SLNs obtained was 2 (range 0-12) and median number of positive SLNs was 0 (range 0-8). Characteristics of the HR-positive subset were similar. In both the overall cohort and the HR-positive subset, SLN status significantly affected the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, although no significant effect on recurrence was observed. SLN-negative patients had better overall survival and less distant recurrence (bothp < 0.0001). Adjuvant hormone therapy significantly improved overall survival.Conclusions. SLNB can be safely omitted in elderly patients with T1, HR-positive, invasive ductal carcinoma tumors, but may still provide important information affecting treatment. Patients who are candidates for adjuvant systemic chemotherapy should still be considered for SLNB.

TI  - Spatial-temporal distribution of atmospheric temperature anomalies connected with seismic activity in Tien-Shan
T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we analyzed spatial-temporal temperature changes in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) above the Northern and Central Tien-Shan detected by satellite remote sensing which have been compared against seismic activity in (1992-2015). These anomalous changes in temperature time series were used as pre-seismic indicators. Anomalous variation parameters were calculated accounting for amplitude and phase of short-time temperature variations at UTLS isobaric levels separated by the tropopause. The results show that the spatial structure and dynamics of temperature anomalies in the area of UTLS have a sufficiently stable relation to seismic activity. We estimated the spatial and time variability of anomalous temperature perturbations on the basis of 12 strongest earthquakes with magnitudes M >= 5.0. The temperature anomalies were observed in all considered cases from similar to 3 to 72 hours before the main seismic event.

TI  - Analyses of the Pradnik riverbed Shape Based on Archival and Contemporary Data Sets-Old Maps, LiDAR, DTMs, Orthophotomaps and Cross-Sectional Profile Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyses of riverbed shape evolution are crucial for environmental protection and local water management. For narrow rivers located in forested, mountain areas, it is difficult to use remote sensing data used for large river regions. We performed a study of the Pradnik River, located in the Ojcow National Park (ONP), Poland. A multitemporal analysis of various data sets was performed. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based data and orthophotomaps were compared with classical survey methods, and 78 cross-sectional profiles were done via GNSS and tachymetry. In order to add an extra time step, the old maps of this region were gathered, and their content was compared with contemporary data. The analysis of remote sensing data suggests that they do not provide sufficient information on the state and changes of riverbanks, river course or river depth. LiDAR data sets do not show river bottoms, and, due to plant life, do not document riverbanks. The orthophotomaps, due to tree coverage and shades, cannot be used for tracking the whole river course. The quality of old maps allows only for general shape analysis over time. This paper shows that traditional survey methods provide sufficient accuracy for such analysis, and the resulted cross-sectional profiles can and should be used to validate other, remote sensing, data sets. We diagnosed problems with the inventory and monitoring of such objects and proposed methods to refine the data acquisition.

TI  - Geoecological Zoning of the Northeastern Caspian
T2  - ARID ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the role of the landscape structure of the northeastern Caspian region in the development of geoecological processes. The goal of the study was to conduct geoecological zoning of the northeastern Caspian based on a study of the main factors determining the nature and intensity of the development of modern landscapes and the main geoecological processes: the altitudinal and geomorphological differentiation of the territory that has developed during the long history of the development of the region; significant periodic fluctuations in the level of the Caspian Sea; and development in the region of economic activity, including the oil industry. A map of the spatial differentiation of geoecological processes in the landscapes of the northeastern Caspian was compiled based on their study within various anthropogenic modifications in six key areas. The spatial distribution of geoecological processes in the landscapes of the studied region was determined by direct and indirect deciphering features with synthesized multizonal satellite images from Landsat 5 and 7. Based on this map, a map of the geoecological zoning of the northeastern Caspian region was compiled via geoinformation mapping in the ArcGis 10.3 program. The map contained 25 geoecological regions and 127 subareas-territorial subdivisions (subspecies of modern landscapes) differing by the same type of natural (landscape) and anthropogenic factors of their formation. These factors determine the geographical distribution and the prevalence of certain geoecological processes.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction There have been no time-series studies of air pollution in Peru. Here we evaluate the effect of ambient PM(2.5)on emergency room (ER) visits in Lima. Methods We estimated daily PM(2.5)levels at a 1 km(2)resolution during 2010-2016 using ground measurements, satellite data, and chemical transport model simulations. Population-weighted average daily PM(2.5)levels were calculated for each district in Lima (n = 40), and assigned to patients based on residence. ER visits for respiratory and circulatory diseases were gathered from nine large public hospitals. Poisson regression was used to estimate the rate ratio for daily ER visits with change in daily PM2.5, controlling for meteorology, time trends, and district. Results For each interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5, respiratory disease ER visits increased 4% (95% CI: 0-5%), stroke visits 10% (3-18%), and ischemic heart disease visits (adults, 18-64 years) 11% (-1, 24%). Districts with higher poverty showed significantly stronger associations of PM(2.5)and respiratory disease ER visits than districts with lower poverty. Effects were diminished 24-42% using Lima-wide instead of district-specific PM(2.5)levels. Conclusions Short-term exposure to ambient PM(2.5)is associated with increases in ER visits in Lima for respiratory diseases and stroke, and among middle-aged adults, ischemic heart disease.

TI  - Remote sensing data for calibrating hydrologic modeling: Hydrological impacts of land use change of the Reventado river sub-basin, Costa Rica
T2  - REVISTA FORESTAL MESOAMERICA KURU-RFMK
M3  - Article
AB  - The "Ecological rehabilitation pilot plan of the Irazu Volcano National Park - Prusia Sector" intends to determine an ecological rehabilitation plan for current 54-year unmanaged exotic forest plantation. This study aims to determine water balance impacts on land cover changes over the Reventado river sub-basin. Thus, three scenarios were considered: Current (current cover conditions), Pasture (exotic forest plantations converted to pasture) and Forest (exotic forest plantations to natural forest). No field data was available for calibration; therefore MODIS16A2 product was used to calibrate evapotranspiration from hydrologic modeling using SWAT. An analysis was performed to determine if estimates vary using two models: 1) parameterized but non-calibrated approach (PNCA), and 2) parameterized and calibrated approach (PCA). Overall, using MODIS16A2 for calibration was satisfactory, showing statistically significant differences in ET, PERC, SURQ and GWQ. The PCA was then used for estimating the impact on water balance variables due to land cover change scenarios -previously mentioned. Slightly differences between Current and Forest scenarios were perceived, whereas Pasture showed 5 % annual increment in surface runoff and 3 % annual decrement of ground water contribution to stream. Thus, careful wood extraction and rehabilitation planning is needed in order to assure low impacts in the hydrological behavior of the sub-basin.

TI  - 'Naddniprianska Pravda' as Means of Covering Atheistic Propaganda in Kherson Region of Ukrainian SSR (the Second Half of the 1940s - the First Half of the 1960s)
T2  - EMINAK
M3  - Article
AB  - The publications on atheistic issues in the `Naddniprianska Pravda' the print newspaper of Kherson regional and city committees of the Communist Party of Ukraine CP(b)U, regional, and city councils of workers' deputies are analyzed in the paper. The works covering the activities of communist party structures and Soviet cultural and educational institutions aimed at spreading the materialist worldview dominated on the pages of this newspaper in the postwar period. Besides the publications highlighting the achievements in propaganda activities, there were the materials showing the true attitude of citizens towards Soviet ideological campaigns. In particular, a 1949 publication noted that in Skadovsk District House of Culture named after Telman agitation and propaganda were on the decline.With the coming to power of M.S. Khrushchov, the Central Committee of the CPSU issued a resolution On Major Flaws in Scientific-Atheistic Propaganda and Measures for Its Improvement of July 7, 1954, after which on the pages of `Naddniprianska Pravda' appeared more than ten publications calling for intensified atheistic propaganda. Thus, one of the articles of 1954 stated that Soviet intelligentsia `has an honorable and noble task - to help the Party form the consciousness of a new person, to promote rapid liberation from know-nothing, ignorance, superstitions, as well as from the shameful vestiges of the past'.Besides, the articles criticizing religion as a phenomenon were published using the creative works of writers for atheistic propaganda, condemning believers who participated in the celebration of religious holidays. For example, the celebration of Christmas, Epiphany Day, Shrovetide, and Easter were associated with alcohol abuse, and so on.Since the late 1950s, a number of articles showing the transition to the increasing administrative pressure on the clergy and laymen were published. The letters from the former clergy, who, apparently under pressure, broke up with religion were published, as well as materials obstructing both clergy, priests, and citizens who continued to attend churches.

TI  - An Algorithm to Estimate Suspended Particulate Matter Concentrations and Associated Uncertainties from Remote Sensing Reflectance in Coastal Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) is a major constituent in coastal waters, involved in processes such as light attenuation, pollutant propagation, and waterways blockage. The spatial distribution of SPM is an indicator of deposition and erosion patterns in estuaries and coastal zones and a necessary input to estimate the material fluxes from the land through rivers to the sea. In-situ methods to estimate SPM provide limited spatial data in comparison to the coverage that can be obtained remotely. Ocean color remote sensing complements field measurements by providing estimates of the spatial distributions of surface SPM concentration in natural waters, with high spatial and temporal resolution. Existing methods to obtain SPM from remote sensing vary between purely empirical ones to those that are based on radiative transfer theory together with empirical inputs regarding the optical properties of SPM. Most algorithms use a single satellite band that is switched to other bands for different ranges of turbidity. The necessity to switch bands is due to the saturation of reflectance as SPM concentration increases. Here we propose a multi-band approach for SPM retrievals that also provides an estimate of uncertainty, where the latter is based on both uncertainties in reflectance and in the assumed optical properties of SPM. The approach proposed is general and can be applied to any ocean color sensor or in-situ radiometer system with red and near-infra-red bands. We apply it to six globally distributed in-situ datasets of spectral water reflectance and SPM measurements over a wide range of SPM concentrations collected in estuaries and coastal environments (the focus regions of our study). Results show good performance for SPM retrieval at all ranges of concentration. As with all algorithms, better performance may be achieved by constraining empirical assumptions to specific environments. To demonstrate the flexibility of the algorithm we apply it to a remote sensing scene from an environment with highly variable sediment concentrations.

TI  - Predictive Value of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Based on the AJCC-8 and Brigham and Women's Hospital Staging Criteria
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Recommendations on when to perform sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) are lacking despite the tumor's clear predilection for lymphatic spread. OBJECTIVE To analyze the frequency of SLN metastasis in published series of cSCC in the context of the eighth edition of the American joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC-8) and the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) staging criteria. METHODS Systematic review of studies of patients with cSCC who underwent SLN biopsy that described biopsy results. RESULTS In total, 153 patients with 24 positive SLN biopsies (15.7%) were included. Based on the AJCC-8 criteria positivity rates in the T2 and T3 categories were 8.3% (1/12 patients) and 25% (8/32), respectively. Using the BWH system there were, 2/33 in category T2a (6.5%), and 5/17 in category T2b (29.8%). On applying the same criteria to tumors of the trunk and extremities the results were similar. CONCLUSION It would seem reasonable to recommend SLN biopsy for patients with AJCC-8 Stage T3+ disease or BWH Stage T2b/T3 disease. Both the AJCC-8 and the BWH systems would appear to be useful for staging cSCC of the trunk and extremities.

TI  - Spatial-temporal dynamics of cropland ecosystem water-use efficiency and the responses to agricultural water management in the Shiyang River Basin, northwestern China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To deal with serious water resources crisis, the Shiyang River Basin (SRB) of Hexi Corridor in Northwestern China has been experiencing rehabilitation for water-saving since 2006. Water-use efficiency in cropland (WUEc) is a critical indicator to understand the response of carbon-water interactions. Because we currently lack a clear picture of how WUEc responds to climate and human activities factors in the SRB, here we applied Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images to obtain a regional estimation of gross primary productivity in cropland (GPPc) and actual evapotranspiration in cropland (ETc), and analyzed the variations in WUEc and climate and human activities factors, then we evaluated the annual WUEc responses to climate and human activity factors and discussed major driving factors underlying the interannual variability (IAV) of WUEc from 2000 to 2014 in the SRB. Finally, we clarified the implications of the water saving project (WSP) on the water cycle. Results indicated that increased WUEc covered 97.25 % of the cropland area, with a trend of 0.017 g C kg(-1) H2O yr(-1). ETc decreased at 0.41 mm yr(-1). ETc decreasing pixel mainly occurred in the irrigation districts of WSP completed by 2010. The IAV of WUEc was mainly determined by ETc (68 %) rather than GPPc (6%). The relative contribution of human activities factors in the WSP to ETc was 77.5 %, while that of climate factors was 22.5 %. Which further proved water availability increase was mainly artificially controlled, an effect of the WSP rather than that of climate factors.

TI  - Assessment of the Representativeness of MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth Products at Different Temporal Scales Using Global AERONET Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessments of long-term changes of air quality and global radiative forcing at a large scale heavily rely on satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) datasets, particularly their temporal binning products. Although some attempts focusing on the validation of long-term satellite AOD have been conducted, there is still a lack of comprehensive quantification and understanding of the representativeness of satellite AOD at different temporal binning scales. Here, we evaluated the performances of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD products at various temporal scales by comparing the MODIS AOD datasets from both the Terra and Aqua satellites with the entire global AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observation archive between 2000 and 2017. The uncertainty levels of the MODIS hourly and daily AOD products were similarly high, indicating that MODIS AOD retrievals could be used to represent daily aerosol conditions. The MODIS data showed the reduced quality when integrated from the daily to monthly scale, where the relative mean bias (RMB) changed from 1.09 to 1.21 for MODIS Terra and from 1.04 to 1.17 for MODIS Aqua, respectively. The limitation of valid data availability within a month appeared to be the primary reason for the increased uncertainties in the monthly binning products, and the monthly data associated uncertainties could be reduced when the number of valid AOD retrievals reached 15 times in one month. At all three temporal scales, the uncertainty levels of satellite AOD products decreased with increasing AOD values. The results of this study could provide crucial information for satellite AOD users to better understand the reliability of different temporal AOD binning products and associated uncertainties in their derived long-term trends.

TI  - Synergy of Satellite- and Ground-Based Observations for Continuous Monitoring of Atmospheric Stability, Liquid Water Path, and Integrated Water Vapor: Theoretical Evaluations Using Reanalysis and Neural Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric stability plays an essential role in the evolution of weather events. While the upper troposphere is sampled by satellite sensors, and in situ sensors measure the atmospheric state close to the surface, only sporadic information from radiosondes or aircraft observations is available in the planetary boundary layer. Ground-based remote sensing offers the possibility to continuously and automatically monitor the atmospheric state in the boundary layer. Microwave radiometers (MWR) provide temporally resolved temperature and humidity profiles in the boundary layer and accurate values of integrated water vapor and liquid water path, and the differential absorption lidar (DIAL) measures humidity profiles with high vertical and temporal resolution up to 3000-m height. Both instruments have the potential to complement satellite observations by additional information from the lowest atmospheric layers, particularly under cloudy conditions. This study presents a neural network retrieval for stability indices, integrated water vapor, and liquid water path from simulated satellite- and ground- based measurements based on the COSMO regional reanalysis (COSMO-REA2). Focusing on the temporal resolution, the satellite-based instruments considered in the study are the currently operational Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) and the future Infrared Sounder (IRS), both in geostationary orbit. Relative to the retrieval based on satellite observations, the additional ground-based MWR/DIAL measurements provide valuable improvements not only in the presence of clouds, which represent a limiting factor for infrared SEVIRI/IRS, but also under clear-sky conditions. The root-mean-square error for convective available potential energy, for instance, is reduced by 24% if IRS observations are complemented by ground-based MWR measurements.

AB  - Open-pit or underground mining both causes environmental impacts such as air, soil, water pollution, etc., especially causing land subsidence of mines and surrounding areas. Research on mining subsidence is often carried out by field survey, the advantage of this method is high accuracy, but it is usually applied in a small scale. Recently, with the development of radar technology, there have been many studies applying this Radar Interferometry technique to determine surface subsidence over a wide range with a few millimeters accuracy. In this paper, 24 Sentinel-1 images were used as input materials, using the Permanent Scatter Interferometry (PSInSAR) method to determine the land subsidence of the Tan My-Thuong Tan quarries and surrounding areas. The results were compared with the average annual subsidence of 20 surveying points using GNSS technology from 1/2018 to 3/2020. The correlation coefficient of annual average land subsidence of the two methods is 0.83, showing the feasibility of applying InSAR Sentinel-1 data processed by PSInSAR method for determining mine surface deformation and surrounding area.

TI  - Leading-edge disequilibrium in alder and spruce populations across the forest-tundra ecotone
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution and composition of Arctic vegetation are expected to shift with ongoing climate change. Global models generally predict northward shifts in high-latitude ecotones, and analysis of remote sensing data shows widespread greening and changes in vegetation structure across the circumpolar Arctic. However, there are still uncertainties related to the timing of these shifts and variation among different plant functional types. In this paper, we investigate disequilibrium dynamics of green alder and white spruce in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastal Plain, NWT. We used high-resolution air photographs captured in the 1970s and 2000s to quantify changes in the distribution and abundance of alder and spruce near their northern limits. We found increases in alder and spruce stem density over time, but no change in their range limits, indicating that both species are affected by leading-edge disequilibrium. Low stand density and temperature limitation of reproduction along the northern margin likely contributed to observed disequilibrium in both species. We also observed the greatest change in species occupancy within a burned area, suggesting that the increased frequency of fire will play a significant role in the timing and magnitude of near-term vegetation change.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we experiment an approach allowing to produce a coherent land use and cover of rangelands in the French Mediterranean areas represented by the Occitania and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur regions. Four different data sources are used: the OSO land use and cover (OSO), the Registre Parcellaire Graphique (RPG), the BD-Foret V.2.0 and Sentinel 2 L3A satellite data. The RPG of 2019 and the BD-Foret updated in 2018 were used as the main source of reference data for training the models to classify the OSO 2019 low F-score class objects, after extraction of the reflectances, spectral and textural indices variables derived from Sentinel 2 L3A data. Three different sizes of reference data are constructed. Then six models were trained using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm: 3 models from the 3 datasets integrating all extracted variables (98) and 3 models considering only the important variables (30) defined by the RF. The results show stable overall accuracies for all datasets used and produce better discrimination of three out of four classes: grasslands, perennial crops and forests. Moorlands are not well discriminated due to their high spatial heterogeneity.

TI  - A Study on Sentinel Node and Occult Lesion Localisation: Do We Really Need an Intraoperative Frozen Examination?
T2  - ISTANBUL MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The sentinel node and occult lesion localisation (SNOLL) technique combines radio-guided occult lesion localisation and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using radioisotopes. In addition to the success of the SNOLL procedure, we investigated the efficacy and necessity of intraoperative frozen pathology in terms of clear margins and reinterventions in non-palpable breast lesions (NPBLs).Methods: The study was conducted at a single centre, in a general surgery clinic between 2006-2016. The medical records of 83 patients with NPBLs and negative axillae were acquired. Before surgery, patients were administered peritumoral and subdermal radionuclide tracer at the axillary region. All the patients underwent breast-conserving surgery and SLNB using a gamma probe following SNOLL.Results: A malignancy was detected in 78 of 83 lesions. Analyses of intraoperative frozen sections showed that the surgical margins were clear in 35 (44.9%), close in 17 (21.7%), and involved in 26 (33.3%) patients. Patients in the latter two groups underwent intraoperative re-excision of the tumour. On the final paraffin sections, surgical margin positivity was determined in seven (9%) patients. Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were detected successfully in 77 of 78 patients (98.7%). The overall success rate of the SNOLL procedure was 88.5% (69/78) in patients surgically treated in a single operation. Intraoperative re-excision was beneficial in only 3 of 78 (3.8%) patients.Conclusion: SNOLL is a feasible, simple, and time-saving method for localising non-palpable breast cancers and SLNs. However, the contribution of margin assessment using frozen sections to the success of the method is limited.

TI  - Large-Scale Operational Pyriproxyfen Autodissemination Deployment to Suppress the Immature Asian Tiger Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) Populations
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective suppression of container-inhabiting Asian Tiger [Aedes albopictus (Skuse)] (Diptera: Culicidae) and yellow fever [Aedes aegypti (L.)] (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes presents one of the most intractable problems for modern mosquito control. Traditional tools often fail to control populations of these mosquito species, and are prohibitively expensive or have negative environmental impacts. Novel approaches and tools are urgently needed for integrated container-inhabiting mosquito management programs. One of the most promising techniques is autodissemination. We present the results of a long-term large-scale study conducted in a temperate urbanized environment representing typical Ae. albopictus habitats. Three treatment sites with autodissemination stations and three nearby reference sites were monitored for eggs, immature, and adult mosquitoes over a period of 3 yr from 2014 to 2016. Elevated larval and pupal mortality of 12-19% on average was the most notable outcome in sentinel cups of the treatment sites. The number of eggs in the treatment sites was significantly reduced in 2014, but not in 2015 or 2016. Adult populations remained similar in treatment and reference sites throughout the study.The impact of autodissemination on mosquito populations was lower than reported by previous investigations.Technical and logistical problems associated with wider coverage and working in multiple urban neighborhoods contributed to reduced efficacy. Incorporating autodissemination with routine mosquito control operations and commercializing this methodology for general public use will require further research on combining this tool with other novel or conventional technologies.

T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-NANOMEDICINE AND NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a noninvasive hybrid imaging modality offering rich optical contrast and high depth-to-resolution ratio deep-tissue imaging. Endogenous chromophores present in the body such as hemoglobin, lipid, melanin, and so on provide strong photoacoustic contrast due to their strong light absorption in certain optical window. To enhance the performance of PAI further, researchers have developed several exogenous contrast agents such as metallic nanoparticles, carbon-based nanomaterials, quantum dots, organic small molecules, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles, and so on. These exogenous contrast agents not only help improving the imaging contrast, but also make targeted molecular imaging possible. In this review article, we first discuss the state-of-the-art PAI techniques with endogenous contrast mechanism. Later, we provide an overview of recent progress in the development of exogenous photoacoustic contrast agents for in vivo imaging applications. Finally, we present the pros/cons of the existing PA contrast agents along with future challenges of contrast agent-based PAI for biomedical applications.This article is categorized under:Diagnostic Tools > Diagnostic NanodevicesDiagnostic Tools > In Vivo Nanodiagnostics and Imaging

TI  - Correlates of forest-cover change in European Russia, 1989-2012
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - European Russia rapidly transitioned after the collapse of the Soviet Union from state socialism to a market economy. How did this political and economic transformation interact with ecological conditions to determine forest loss and gain? We explore this question with a study of European Russia in the two decades following the collapse of the Soviet Union. We identify three sets of potential determinants of forest-cover change-supply-side (environmental), demand-side (economic), and political/administrative factors. Using new satellite data for three distinct types of forest-cover change-logging, forest fires, and forest gain-we quantify the relative importance of these variables in province-level regression models during periods of a) state collapse (1990s), and b) state growth (2000s). The three sets of covariates jointly explain considerable variation in the outcomes we examine, with size of forest bureaucracy, autonomous status of the region, and prevalence of evergreen forests emerging as robust predictors of forest-cover change. Overall, economic and administrative variables are significantly associated with rates of logging and reforestation, while environmental variables have high explanatory power for patterns of forest fire loss.

TI  - Assessing Spatial Limits of Sentinel-2 Data on Arable Crops in the Context of Checks by Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of large amounts of Sentinel-2 data has been a trigger for its increasing exploitation in various types of applications. It is, therefore, of importance to understand the limits above which these data still guarantee a meaningful outcome. This paper proposes a new method to quantify and specify restrictions of the Sentinel-2 imagery in the context of checks by monitoring, a newly introduced control approach within the European Common Agriculture Policy framework. The method consists of a comparison of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series constructed from data of different spatial resolution to estimate the performance and limits of the coarser one. Using similarity assessment of Sentinel-2 (10 m pixel size) and PlanetScope (3 m pixel size) NDVI time series, it was estimated that for 10% out of 867 fields less than 0.5 ha in size, Sentinel-2 data did not provide reliable evidence of the activity or state of the agriculture field over a given timeframe. Statistical analysis revealed that the number of clean or full pixels and the proportion of pixels lost after an application of a 5-m (1/2 pixel) negative buffer are the geospatial parameters of the field that have the highest influence on the ability of the Sentinel-2 data to qualify the field's state in time. We specified the following limiting criteria: at least 8 full pixels inside a border and less than 60% of pixels lost. It was concluded that compliance with the criteria still assures a high level of extracted information reliability. Our research proved the promising potential, which was higher than anticipated, of Sentinel-2 data for the continuous state assessment of small fields. The method could be applied to other sensors and indicators.

TI  - Roasting a Pig in Front of a Mosque: How Pork Matters in Pegida's Anti-Islam Protest in Eindhoven
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article provides an analysis of a public protest by the far-right group Pegida-Netherlands, where the participants attempted to demonstratively eat pork near a mosque in Eindhoven on 26 May 2019. This led to fierce responses: hundreds of young Muslim counter-protesters prevented the Pegida supporters from reaching the mosque, shouting insults at them and throwing stones at the police. Based on field notes from the event and a variety of other research material, this article shows how pork becomes a means of provocation in a larger entanglement between people and their perceived intentions, other objects, times and places. Furthermore, the author argues that the clash between protesters and counter-protesters can be seen as a theatrical performance set up by Pegida to share its worldview with a wide audience, and critically analyzes the role of pork in Pegida's attempt to 'reclaim Dutch territory' that has been 'lost to Islamization'. Last but not least, this article discusses how provocations bring about counter-provocations. As such, this article shows the value of a material approach to the study of conflicts, and critically evaluates Pegida-Netherlands' official stance of non-violence vis-a-vis the implications of its protest language.

TI  - Characterizing spatial patterns of pine bark beetle outbreaks during the dry and rainy season's in Honduras with the aid of geographic information systems and remote sensing data
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coniferous and mixed forests cover approximately 42% of Honduras forested areas, however; pine bark beetle (PBB) (Dendroctonus spp.) outbreaks are an environmental hazard that has caused incalculable ecological and economic impacts in Honduras. In this research, in order to plan more focalized measures for controlling the PBB outbreaks, it is essential to identify those areas that have a high susceptibility to a PBB outbreak during the dry and rainy seasons. For this purpose, we require to associate the historical PBB outbreak points (2017-2019), with a series of environmental and anthropogenic variables that according to the literature review have affected the initiation and the spread of PBB outbreaks. To assess the current climatic variables we used MODIS land surface temperature product (LST-MOD11A2), wind speed, precipitation, and temperature acquired from the WorldClim data. To assess vegetation vigor, we use the Normalized drought moisture index estimated from the MODIS surface reflectance product (MODO9A3). To give us an understanding of the density of the forest, we compare two products, the MODIS Leaf Area Index (LAI-MOD15A2H), and the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VFC-MOD44B). We included elevation, aspect, and slope as variables and acquired this data from the Global multiresolution terrain elevation data (GMTED-2010). Finally, we used geographical information systems data to derive proximity to different types of roads as anthropogenic data and wildfire density. We do a preliminary analysis of the variables and eliminated those which show the least importance. Furthermore, we integrated the most relevant variables identified with the PBB points by using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to fit the model and then predicted the current PBB outbreak susceptibility for the dry and rainy season. Results indicated that climatic variables weigh heavily in determining high susceptibility areas. Our prediction results show high and very high susceptibility in the North-eastern and Central parts of the country especially. The results acquired, can lead to improved preventive and control measures to reduce the negative ecological effects that are caused by PBB outbreaks.

TI  - Characterization of the complete mitochondrial genome of a coconut crab, <i>Birgus latro</i> (Linnaeus, 1767) (Decapoda: Anomura: Coenobitidae), from Okinawa, Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a full description and analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome of a Pacific Ocean specimen of the coconut crab Birgus latro (Linnaeus, 1767), the largest extant terrestrial arthropod in the world. Our de novo-assembled mitogenome has a massive 16,161 times organelle read coverage, a length of 16,411 bp, contains 22 tDNAs (20 unique), 13 protein-coding genes, two rDNAs, and a putative control region of length 1,381 bp. The control region contains three microsatellites and two pairs of inverted repeats. Contrary to the mitochondrial sentinel gene concept, two-dimensional nucleotide analysis reveals higher GC-content in COX gene families than in NADH gene families. Moreover, COX gene families are more conserved than NADH gene families among the species of Coenobitidae selected for comparison. Secondary structure prediction of the 22 tDNAs shows major deviations from the cloverleaf pattern, which points to a relatively high rate of mutation in these genes. We also present a repertoire of mitochondrial variation between our male Okinawan coconut crab and an Indian Ocean specimen that consists of one insertion, one deletion, 135 SNPs, three MNPs and nine complex polymorphisms. We provide confirmatory evidence that the superfamily Paguroidea, to which the coconut crab belongs, is polyphyletic, that all the proteincoding genes of B. latro are under purifying selection, and that a Pacific versus Indian Ocean coconut crab population divergence occurred during the Pleistocene.

TI  - The EORTC-DeCOG nomogram adequately predicts outcomes of patients with sentinel node-positive melanoma without the need for completion lymph node dissection
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Based on recent advances in the management of patients with sentinel node (SN)-positive melanoma, we aimed to develop prediction models for recurrence, distant metastasis (DM) and overall mortality (OM).Methods: The derivation cohort consisted of 1080 patients with SN-positive melanoma from nine European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) centres. Prognostic factors for recurrence, DM and OM were studied with Cox regression analysis. Significant factors were incorporated in the models. Performance was assessed by discrimination (c-index) and calibration in cross-validation across centres. The models were externally validated using a prospective cohort consisting of 705 German patients with SN-positive: 473 trial participants of the German Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group study (DeCOG-SLT) and 232 screened patients. A nomogram was developed for graphical presentation.Results: The final model for recurrence and the calibrated models for DM and OM included ulceration, age, SN tumour burden and Breslow thickness. The models showed reasonable calibration. The c-index for the recurrence, DM and OM model was 0.68, 0.70 and 0.70, respectively, and 0.70, 0.72 and 0.74, respectively, in external validation. The EORTCDeCOG model identified a robust low-risk group, with all identified low-risk patients (approximately 4% of the entire population) having a 5-year recurrence probability of <25% and an overall 5-year recurrence rate of 13%. A model including information on completion lymph node dissection (CLND) showed only marginal improvement in model performance.Conclusions: The EORTC-DeCOG nomogram provides an adequate prognostic tool for patients with SN-positive melanoma, without the need for CLND. It showed consistent results across validation. The nomogram could be used for patient counselling and might aid in adjuvant therapy decision-making. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Could fluorescence-guided surgery be an efficient and sustainable option? A SICE (Italian Society of Endoscopic Surgery) health technology assessment summary
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Indocyanine green fluorescence vision is an upcoming technology in surgery. It can be used in three ways: angiographic and biliary tree visualization and lymphatic spreading studies. The present paper shows the most outstanding results from an health technology assessment study design, conducted on fluorescence-guided compared with standard vision surgery. Methods A health technology assessment approach was implemented to investigate the economic, social, ethical, and organizational implications related to the adoption of the innovative fluorescence-guided view, with a focus on minimally invasive approach. With the support of a multidisciplinary team, qualitative and quantitative data were collected, by means of literature evidence, validated questionnaires and self-reported interviews, considering the dimensions resulting from the EUnetHTA Core Model. Results From a systematic search of literature, we retrieved the following studies: 6 on hepatic, 1 on pancreatic, 4 on biliary, 2 on bariatric, 4 on endocrine, 2 on thoracic, 11 on colorectal, 7 on urology, 11 on gynecology, 2 on gastric surgery. Fluorescence guide has shown advantages on the length of hospitalization particularly in colorectal surgery, with a reduction of the rate of leakages and re-do anastomoses, in spite of a slight increase in operating time, and is confirmed to be a safe, efficacious, and sustainable vision technology. Clinical applications are still presenting a low evidence in the literature. Conclusion The present paper, under the patronage of Italian Society of Endoscopic Surgery, based on an HTA approach, sustains the use of fluorescence-guided vision in minimally invasive surgery, in the fields of general, gynecologic, urologic, and thoracic surgery, as an efficient and economically sustainable technology.

TI  - Prognostic Significance of Sentinel Headache Preceding Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel headache (SH) is often assumed to portend an increased risk of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and aneurysm rebleeding. This study aimed to re-evaluate the associations between SH and aneurysm rebleeding, DCI, and outcome after SAH.METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1102 patients with spontaneous SAH and available data regarding history of SH who were enrolled in the Columbia University SAH Outcomes Project between 1996 and 2009. Patients were asked whether they had experienced any episodes of acute, sudden-onset severe headache in the 2 weeks preceding the most recent bleeding event. DCI was defined as neurologic deterioration, infarction, or both due to vasospasm. Rebleeding was defined as the appearance of new hemorrhage on computed tomography. Outcome was assessed at 3 months by telephone interview using the modified Rankin Scale.RESULTS: SH was reported in 152 (14%) of 1102 patients. There were no significant differences between patients with and without SH with regard to admission Hunt-Hess grade or modified Fisher Scale. There was also no difference with regard to the frequency of aneurysm rebleeding (10% vs. 8%, P = 0.42), DCI (18% vs, 20%, P = 0.64), moderate-or-severe angiographic vasospasm on follow-up angiography (51% vs. 56%, P = 0.43), highest recorded mean middle cerebral artery flow velocity on transcranial Doppler (134 versus 128 cm/s, P = 0.30), or the distribution of modified Rankin Scale scores at 3 months.CONCLUSIONS: A history of sentinel headache before the clinical diagnosis of SAH does not imply an increased risk of DCI or further rebleeding, and carries no prognostic significance.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We used AdaBoost (AB), alternating decision tree (ADTree), and their combination as an ensemble model (AB-ADTree) to spatially predict landslides in the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. The models were trained with a database of 152 landslides compiled using Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry, Google Earth images, and field surveys, and 17 conditioning factors (slope, aspect, elevation, distance to road, distance to river, proximity to fault, road density, river density, normalized difference vegetation index, rainfall, land cover, lithology, soil types, curvature, profile curvature, stream power index, and topographic wetness index). We carried out the validation process using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and several parametric and non-parametric performance metrics, including positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, root mean square error, and the Friedman and Wilcoxon sign rank tests. The AB model (AUC = 0.96) performed better than the ensemble AB-ADTree model (AUC = 0.94) and successfully outperformed the ADTree model (AUC = 0.59) in predicting landslide susceptibility. Our findings provide insights into the development of more efficient and accurate landslide predictive models that can be used by decision makers and land-use managers to mitigate landslide hazards.

TI  - Patterns of Vegetation and Climatic Conditions Derived from Satellite Images Relevant for Sub-Antarctic Rangeland Management
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sub-Antarctic rangelands are characterized by weather seasonality and abundant winter snowfall. These climate factors determine most livestock management decisions. Nonetheless, data on these weather patterns are only available for some areas of the region, and management is entirely empirically-derived. The aim of this study was twofold: to compile spatial and temporal environmental information of rangelands in the Magallanes Region of Chile by using satellite images and to provide an example for local purposes through a simple evaluation of current grazing systems of four ranches in central Tierra del Fuego using satellite-derived image products and a known thermal comfort zone for sheep. To determine the environmental conditions of the region, we processed a 12-year (2000-2011) series of three MODIS-Terra platform products: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an index of photosynthetic activity, snow cover index, and Land Surface Temperature (LST). Results indicate that data obtained from satellite images follow the known seasonality of the region and deliver spatial and temporal environmental information (e.g., temperature at large scale) for most ranching areas of the region where it was formerly unavailable. The determined grazing period of analyzed ranches for winter range was May 8 to September 29. These tools show promise to encourage management innovation from simple applications to combine platforms and models for forage monitoring and ranch management in Sub-Antarctic rangelands.

TI  - UV-Index Climatology for Europe Based on Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The UV-Index (UVI) is aimed at the prevention of skin cancer as well as other negative implications of ultraviolet radiation exposure. In order to support health related applications, assessments and planning that rely on long term data in high spatial resolution and as there exist only limited ground-based measurements, satellite products from reliable atmospheric monitoring services are used as sustainable data sources to create a climatology of the UVI at the local noon. In this study, the (all-sky) UVI as well as the hypothetically clear-sky UVI were analysed for the European region from 30 degrees North to 65 degrees North and from 25 degrees West to 35 degrees East in a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees for the time period 1983 to 2015. Maps of the monthly mean UVI provide an overview of the distribution of UVI for Europe as well as the spatial and temporal differences and regional variability at local solar noon. Additionally, eight selected locations provide insight into the effects of latitude and altitude on UVI in Europe. Monthly boxplots for each location provide information about regional differences in the variability of UVI, showing maximum variability in Northern and Central Europe in summer, where in Southern Europe this basically occurs in spring. The frequency of the World Health Organization exposure categories moderate, high and very high UVI is provided based on ten-day means for each month. The maximum difference between mean values per decade of 2006-2015 compared to 1983-1992 ranges from -1.2 to +1.2 for UVI and from -0.4 to +0.6 for UVIclear-sky. All locations, except the Northern European site, show an increase of UVI during spring and early summer months. A statistically significant increase in the annual mean all-sky UVI has been found for four sites, which ranges from +1.2% to +3.6% per decade. The latest eleven-year period of the UVI climatology (2005-2015) has been validated with UVI measured in five sites. The sites that are located north of the Alps show an underestimation of the UVI, likely due to the cloud modification. In the south, the UVI climatology provides values that are on average overestimated, possibly related to the use of climatological aerosol information. For the site within the Alps, a switch between underestimation and overestimation during the course of the year has been found. 7% to 9% of the UVI values of the climatology differ from the measured UVI by more than one unit.

TI  - Applying Directional Filters to Satellite Imagery for the Assessment of Tropical Cyclone Impacts on Atoll Islands
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper highlights the major insights provided by directional filters using ENVI (R) software for detecting and mapping cyclone-generated accretional features and analyzing postcyclone sediment reworking. It relies on the study of the impacts of category 5 tropical cyclone Fantala (April 2016) on Farquhar Atoll, Seychelles Islands. Using directional filters first allowed the detecting and mapping of terrestrial (sediment sheets, sediment lobes) and intertidal (shingle and rubble tongues, sediment sheets, sandbars) depositional features. It also helped with highlighting spatial-temporal variations in the postcyclone reorganization of reef flat deposits. One year after the cyclone, along the rectilinear shoreline of elongate islands (i.e. North Island and South Island), massive reef-to-island sediment transfer had already caused the dismantling of cyclone-generated features and beach readjustment; however, in places, newly formed cyclone features exhibited limited dismantling. In contrast, at the island tips, the reworking of postcyclone sediment deposits was still ongoing, explaining still rather limited beach readjustment. The results advocate for the use of remote sensing techniques that complement fieldwork and multidate shoreline change assessment to promote more comprehensive analyses of tropical cyclones' impacts.

TI  - Comparative assessment of biomarker response to tissue metal concentrations in urban populations of the land snail <i>Helix pomatia</i> (Pulmonata: Helicidae)
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The traffic pressure is increasing, resulting in the emission of atmospheric pollution. Soil organisms will need to respond to pollution stressors. Among them, land snails are valuable indicators of ecosystem disturbance. In this study, land snails Helix pomatia were sampled from three city localities with different traffic intensity. Oxidative stress biomarkers catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in the foot muscle (FM) and hepatopancreas (HP) tissue were determined. Also, five heavy metal (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) concentrations were quantified in soil and tissue samples. According to the results, the highway induces the strongest contamination on the surrounding environment, with the highest metal concentrations measured in soil and snails. At the most polluted locality, only Cd exceeded some soil guidelines authorities that we referred to in this study. In addition, tissue Cd concentrations exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) value (1 mg kg(-1)) for soil invertebrate toxicity at all localities making it likely responsible for generating adverse effects in snails. Regarding HP, the CAT and GST are the most sensitive parameters that could be useful as oxidative stress biomarkers in snails exposed to the actual metals in the environment. On the other hand, in FM tissue, the most pronounced changes were recorded for GPX and GR. Based on tissue-specific enzyme responses, three urban populations were clearly separated. Therefore land snails are the promising candidates for quick field-based biomarker studies after showing a tissue-specific concentration-dependent induction of certain enzymes to heavy metals.

TI  - Identifying high potential zones of gold mineralization in a sub-tropical region using Landsat-8 and ASTER remote sensing data: A case study of the Ngoura-Colomines goldfield, eastern Cameroon
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic conditions and vegetation constrain the use of optical satellite imagery as an exploration tool for hydrothermal ore mineralization in tropical and subtropical regions. In this investigation, Landsat-8 and ASTER satellite imagery were used to detect hydrothermal alteration zones associated with gold mineralization in the Ngoura-Colomines region, Eastern Cameroon. The study area contains several gold-bearing quartz veins associated with zones of pyritization, muscovite/sericite, iron oxides, and silicification. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and specialized spectral band ratios were used to extract spectral information related to vegetation, iron oxide/hydroxide minerals, Al-OH, Fe-Mg-OH, carbonate group minerals, and silicification using Landsat-8 data at regional scale. Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) algorithm was implemented to ASTER VNIR + SWIR bands for detailed discrimination of hematite, jarosite, kaolinite, muscovite, chlorite and epidote at district scale. The Automated Spectral Hourglass (ASH) technique was employed to extract reference spectra directly from the ASTER bands for producing fraction images of end-members using the LSU. A comprehensive field survey was used to verify the remote sensing results. Petrographic study, X-ray diffraction analysis and reflectance spectroscopy indicated the presence of quartz, goethite and sericite, as well as the absorption features of Fe3+/Fe2+, Al-OH, OH/H2O and SiO2 in the alteration zones. Several hydrothermal alteration zones of iron oxide/hydroxide, clay, carbonate minerals and silicification zones were identified, which are spatially associated with known mining areas and gold occurrences in the study area. High potential prospects were also delineated, including the Ngoura-Colomines prospects and the newly discovered Yangamo-Ndatanga and Tapare-Tapondo prospects in the southwestern and southeastern parts of the study area. Consequently, satellite-based mineral prospectivity maps at regional and district scales were generated for the study area by implementing the fuzzy logic model to the most informative thematic layers derived from image processing results. The satellite-based prospectivity maps are reliable for exploration of new gold prospective zones in the Ngoura-Colomines goldfield.

M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the factors that drive green space composition and richness in heterogeneous urban landscapes is critical for maintaining important ecosystem services and biodiversity. Few studies have been conducted on urban greening and plant diversity at the urban functional unit (UFU) level, although a handful of studies have explored the drivers of greening percentage and its relationships with plant richness in tropical cities. In this study, we conducted field surveys, compiled census and remote sensing data, and performed spatial analyses to investigate the interrelationship between greening percentages, plant diversity, and the socioeconomic variables of different primary and secondary UFUs in the cities of Beijing, Zhanjiang, and Haikou in China. We found that these relationships did not differ significantly between primary and secondary UFUs, and that Parks represented the largest areas of forested land, grassland, and water bodies across all three cities. Moreover, the greening percentages of all UFUs across these three cities were positively correlated with both socioeconomic variables and plant species richness. These relationships can be utilized to guide future green space planning within urban ecosystems.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data products and high-resolution in situ observations were combined to investigate the evolution and structure of the Kuroshio Extension Front in Spring 2019. The former reveals the variation of the front is influenced by the northward movement of the Kuroshio Extension through transporting warm and saline water to a cold and brackish water region. The latter indicates steep upward slopes of the isopycnals, tilting northward in the frontal zone, as well as several similar to 300 m thick blobs of North Pacific Intermediate Water between 26.25 and 26.75 kg/m(3), where conspicuous thermohaline intrusions occur. Further analysis indicates these thermohaline intrusions prefer to alternate salt fingering and diffusive convection interfaces, and are affected by strong shears.

TI  - Co- and Early Postseismic Deformation Due to the 2019 Ridgecrest Earthquake Sequence Constrained by Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed SAR Data
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence ruptured a series of conjugate faults in the broad eastern California shear zone, north of the Mojave Desert in southern California. The average spacing between Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations around the earthquakes is 20-30 km, insufficient to constrain the rupture details of the earthquakes. Here, we use Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) Synthetic Aperture Radar data to derive the high-resolution coseismic and early postseismic surface deformation related to the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence. Line of sight (LoS) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar displacements derived from both Sentinel-1 and CSK data are in good agreement with GNSS measurements. The maximum coseismic displacement occurs near the M-w 7.1 epicenter, with an estimated fault offset of similar to 4:5 m on a north-west-striking rupture. Pixel tracking analysis of CSK data also reveals a sharp surface offset of similar to 1 m on a second northwest-striking fault strand on which the M-w 6.4 foreshock likely nucleated, which is located similar to 2-3 km east of the major rupture. The lack of clear surface displacement across this fault segment during the M-w 6.4 event suggests this fault might have ruptured twice, with more pronounced and shallow slip during the M-w 7.1 mainshock. Both Sentinel-1 and CSK data reveal clear postseismic deformation following the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence. Cumulative postseismic deformation near the M-w 7.1 epicenter similar to 2 months after the mainshock reaches similar to 5 cm along the satellites' LoSs. The observed postseismic deformation near the fault is indicative of both afterslip and poroelastic rebound. We provide data derived in this study in various data formats, which will be useful for the broad community studying this earthquake sequence.

TI  - Satellite-measured water properties in high altitude Lake Tahoe
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been difficult in satellite remote sensing to derive accurate water optical, biological, and biogeochemical products over high-altitude inland waters due to issues in satellite data processing (i.e., atmospheric correction). In this study, we demonstrate that accurate normalized water-leaving radiance spectra nL(w)(lambda) can be derived for a high-altitude lake, Lake Tahoe, using improved Rayleigh radiance computations (Wang, M., Opt. Express, 24, 12414-12429, 2016) which accurately account for water surface altitude effects in the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system. Satellite observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) between 2012 and 2018 are used to evaluate and validate satellite-derived nL(w)(lambda) spectra, and to quantitatively characterize water properties in the lake. Results show that VIIRS-derived nL(w)(lambda) spectra are quite comparable with those from the in situ measurements. Subsequent retrievals of water biological and biogeochemical products show that chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and Secchi depth (SD) are reasonably well-estimated, and captured normal seasonal variations in the lake, e.g., the annual highest Chl-a and SD normally occur in the winter while the lowest occur in the summer, which is consistent with in situ measurements. Interannual variability of these water quality parameters is also observed. In particular, Lake Tahoe experienced a significant environmental anomaly associated with an extreme weather condition event in 2017, showing considerably decreased nL(w)(lambda) at the spectral bands of 410, 443, and 486 nm, and significantly reduced SD values in the entire lake. The low SD measurements from VIIRS are consistent with in situ observations. Following the event in the 2017-2018 winter, Lake Tahoe recovered and returned to its typical conditions in spring 2018.

TI  - Downscale MODIS Land Surface Temperature Based on Three Different Models to Analyze Surface Urban Heat Island: A Case Study of Hangzhou
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology plays an increasingly important role in land surface temperature (LST) research. However, various remote sensing data have spatial-temporal scales contradictions. In order to address this problem in LST research, the current study downscaled LST based on three different models (multiple linear regression (MLR), thermal sharpen (TsHARP) and random forest (RF)) from 1 km to 100 m to analyze surface urban heat island (SUHI) in daytime (10:30 a.m.) and nighttime (10:30 p.m.) of four seasons, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/LST products and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). This research used an area (25 x 25 km) of Hangzhou with high spatial heterogeneity as the study area. R(2)and RMSE were introduced to evaluate the conversion accuracy. Finally, we compared with similarly retrieved LST to verify the feasibility of the method. The results indicated the following. (1) The RF model was the most suitable to downscale MODIS/LST. The MLR model and the TsHARP model were not applicable for downscaling studies in highly heterogeneous regions. (2) From the time dimension, the prediction precision in summer and winter was clearly higher than that in spring and autumn, and that at night was generally higher than during the day. (3) The SUHI range at night was smaller than that during the day, and was mainly concentrated in the urban center. The SUHI of the research region was strongest in autumn and weakest in winter. (4) The validation results of the error distribution histogram indicated that the MODIS/LST downscaling method based on the RF model is feasible in highly heterogeneous regions.

TI  - Growth diffusion-limited aggregation for basin fractal river network evolution model
T2  - AIP ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) model has been widely used to simulate fractal aggregation processes. This DLA model and its improved model growth diffusion-limited aggregation (GDLA) can reasonably plan and manage rivers within the basin scale. In this paper, the growth and evolution of the river network at the basin scale were simulated using the Northwest China Basin as the study area. To achieve this research goal, this paper used gas injection system image processing technology and data analysis methods for overall processing and distributed processing of river basin remote sensing data. A new growth method, unit-gradient growth, was added to the standard DLA model, and a combination of the extracted Daxia River Basin geomorphological features and DEM data was used to optimize the Brownian motion of the model particle growth method. A computational model was proposed: GDLA model to predict the river network growth in the study area. The fractal dimension of the river network in the study area was extracted and corrected by the box-counting method. Finally, the predicted river network was compared with the extracted actual river network. The included angle cosine method was used for modeling evaluation and analysis. The results showed that the fractal dimension of the Daxia River Basin and sub-basin water systems was less than 1.6, indicating that the basin geomorphology was in its infancy. The structural similarity degrees were greater than 0.99, indicating that the GDLA model had a better simulation on fractal river networks, which can successfully reproduce and predict different morphological two-dimensional river networks. Studies showed that using GDLA to model fractal river networks can better predict the river network growth and evolution, ultimately promoting sustainable development of river basin water management.

TI  - Globally Consistent Patterns of Asynchrony in Vegetation Phenology Derived From Optical, Microwave, and Fluorescence Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is impacting vegetation phenology with important implications and feedbacks to global carbon, water, and nutrient cycling. Satellite remote sensing can monitor multiple aspects of land surface phenology and its sensitivity to climate. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) tracks vegetation chlorophyll content. Vegetation optical depth (VOD) tracks the total water content of aboveground biomass. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) more directly approximates vegetation gross photosynthesis. Yet it remains unclear how these different indices, representing independent vegetation development processes, covary over the course of a growing season and across the global domain. To address this gap, we synthesize information from all three indices and enable a deeper understanding of seasonal phenology that goes beyond seasonal photosynthesis. We derive and evaluate 9-year average timing of start of growing season (SOS), peak of growing season (POS), and end of growing season (EOS) for each of these satellite indices globally. We found SOS occurs relatively synchronously, but they become increasingly asynchronous as growing season progresses, such that POS and EOS from SIF occurred first, followed by NDVI and finally by VOD. In contrast to the relatively quick and synchronous start-of-season transition, senescence appears to be a relatively prolonged transition, beginning with reduced photosynthetic activity, then greenness/chlorophyll, and finally plant water content. Comparisons with gross primary productivity from eddy covariance flux tower observations confirm that SIF most closely tracks seasonal photosynthesis. NDVI, VOD, and SIF provide independent, complementary information on seasonal vegetation transitions and reveal new insights into the complex underlying functional and structural processes that control vegetation growth and senescence.

TI  - Omitting ALND Is Not Safe for a Cohort of Early-Stage Breast Cancer Patients with 1-2 SLNs Macro-Metastases and Breast-Conserving Therapy: A Single-Center Retrospective Study
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is recommended for early-stage breast cancer patients with 1-2 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) macro-metastases and breast-conserving therapy. However, it is not safe for part of patients, so it is significant to find risk factors and develop a predictive model of non-SLNs metastases in breast cancer patients with 1-2 SLNs macro-metastases and breast-conserving therapy.Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 228 breast cancer patients with 1-2 SLNs macro-metastases who underwent ALND and breast-conserving surgery between Jan 2012 and Dec 2017 at Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Chi-square test and backward stepwise binary logistic regression were used to find factors that influenced non-SLN metastases, then a predictive model was formulated and obtained its area under the curve.Results: Tumor pathologic invasion size, number of positive SLNs and ALN status on imaging was associated with non-SLNs metastases. The predictive model was also formulated based on these three factors to assess and the area under the curve of model was 0.708.Conclusion: We developed a predictive model to assess the high-risk cohort of patients of non-SLNs metastases which can be an auxiliary tool for doctors.

TI  - Evaluation on the Capability of Revealing Ocean Swells from <i>Sentinel</i>-<i>1A</i> Wave Spectra Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wave measurements retrieved by Sentinel-1A level-2 ocean (OCN) products are sensitive to swells other than wind seas, and are considered to provide a finer resolution of ocean swells. To assess the capability of swell retrieval globally, OCN products are validated against WAVEWATCH III (WW3) wave spectra for two available incidence angles ["wave mode'' (WV); WV1: 23; WV2: 36 degrees], focused on the integral wave parameters and most energetic wave system of Sentinel-1A. The wave parameter difference between Sentinel-1A and WW3 along antenna look angles for WV1 demonstrates the obvious impact of the non-linearity influence in the azimuth direction, resulting in an unrealistically high wave height at the low wave frequency, and the spurious split of wave systems in the range direction, due to the vanishing of velocity bunching modulation. WV2 is less pronounced in these two aspects, but tends to shift wave energy to a higher wave frequency in the range direction. The inside discrepancy of wave energy has two noticeable features: the difference in peak wavelengths in the wave spectrum is positively clustered in the azimuth direction and negatively clustered in the range direction; some of the most energetic partitions derived from Sentinel-1A are difficult to assign to any wave systems in WW3. This phenomenon could be related to wind-wave coupling as the azimuth cutoff/WW3 peak wavelength is confined to a ratio below 0.5 for the negative difference between Sentinel-1A and WW3 peak wavelengths and the spectral distance of most energetic wave system in Sentinel- 1A highly resembles "swell pools.''

TI  - Persistent Vegetation Greening and Browning Trends Related to Natural and Human Activities in the Mount Elgon Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many developing nations are facing severe food insecurity partly because of their dependence on rainfed agriculture. Climate variability threatens agriculture-based community livelihoods. With booming population growth, agricultural land expands, and natural resource extraction increases, leading to changes in land use and land cover characterized by persistent vegetation greening and browning. This can modify local climate variability due to changing land-atmosphere interactions. Yet, for landscapes with significant interannual variability, such as the Mount Elgon ecosystem in Kenya and Uganda, characterizing these changes is a difficult task and more robust methods have been recommended. The current study combined trend (Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope) and breakpoint (bfast) analysis methods to comprehensively examine recent vegetation greening and browning in Mount Elgon at multiple time scales. The study used both Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) data and attempted to disentangle nature- versus human-driven vegetation greening and browning. Inferences from a 2019 field study were valuable in explaining some of the observed patterns. The results indicate that Mount Elgon vegetation is highly variable with both greening and browning observable at all time scales. Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope revealed major changes (including deforestation and reforestation), while bfast detected most of the subtle vegetation changes (such as vegetation degradation), especially in the savanna and grasslands in the northeastern parts of Mount Elgon. Precipitation in the area had significantly changed (increased) in the post-2000 era than before, particularly in 2006-2010, thus influencing greening and browning during this period. The greenness-precipitation relationship was weak in other periods. The integration of Mann-Kendall and bfast proved useful in comprehensively characterizing vegetation greenness. Such a comprehensive description of Mount Elgon vegetation dynamics is an important first step to instigate policy changes for simultaneously conserving the environment and improving livelihoods that are dependent on it.

TI  - An Evaluation of Fengyun-3C Radio Occultation Atmospheric Profiles Over 2015-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) is the first Chinese satellite that is capable of using the Radio Occultation (RO) technique to retrieve atmospheric profiles. This research evaluates the quality of FY-3C RO profiles including refractivity, temperature, and specific humidity by comparing with corresponding information from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim) data over the period of 2015-2018. The evaluation is carried out by calculating and analyzing mean systematic differences between FY-3C and ERA-Interim profiles and corresponding standard deviations over a selected spatial and temporal domain. Results show that the FY-3C RO profiles are overall with good agreements with the ERA-Interim data. Global mean refractivity systematic differences are within +/- 0.2% from 5 to 30 km altitude range with relative standard deviations of less than 2%. Global temperature mean systematic differences vary within +/- 0.2 K from a 10- to 20-km altitude range with standard deviations of less than 2 K. Global mean specific humidity differences are found to be within +/- 0.2 g/kg from 2 to 20 km with standard deviations of less than 1 g/kg. FY-3C profiles show visible latitudinal and altitudinal variations, while the seasonal variations are minor. Sampling errors of refractivity and temperature are also found to be larger at higher latitudinal regions due to RO events being less sampled in the polar region.

TI  - An Efficient Change Detection for Large SAR Images Based on Modified U-Net Framework
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large SAR images usually contain a variety of land-cover types and accordingly complicated change types, which cause great difficulty for accurate change detection. The U-Net is a special fully convolutional neural network that not only can capture multiple features in the image context but also enables precise pixel-by-pixel image classification. Therefore, we explore the U-Net to describe accurately the differences between bi-temporal SAR images for high-precision change detection. However, large scene SAR images often have significantly different statistical distributions for various change types, which prevents the U-Net from working properly. We modified the U-Net by introducing the batch normalization (BN) operation at the input of every neuron to regularize the statistical distributions of its input data for avoiding the risk of gradient disappearance or dispersion during the network training. In addition, the ELU (Exponential Linear Unit) activation function replaces the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function to improve further the gradients backpropagation. Then we selected bi-temporal Sentinel-1SAR data covering Jiangsu Province, China, to discuss quantitatively and qualitatively the detection performance and model complexity of the modified network with different numbers of convolutional kernels.

TI  - Multiple factors influence the consistency of cropland datasets in Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate geo-information of cropland is critical for food security strategy development and grain production management, especially in Africa continent where most countries are food-insecure. Over the past decades, a series of African cropland maps have been derived from remotely-sensed data, existing comparison studies have shown that inconsistencies with statistics and discrepancies among these products are considerable. Yet, there is a knowledge gap about the factors that influence their consistency. The aim of this study is thus to estimate the consistency of five widely-used cropland datasets (MODIS Collection 5, GlobCover 2009, GlobeLand30, CCI-LC 2010, and Unified Cropland Layer) in Africa, and to explore the effects of several limiting factors (landscape fragmentation, climate and agricultural management) on spatial consistency. The results show that total cropland area for Africa derived from GlobeLand30 has the best fitness with FAO statistics, followed by MODIS Collection 5. GlobCover 2009, CCI-LC 2010, and Unified Cropland Layer have poor performances as indicated by larger deviations from statistics. In terms of spatial consistency, disagreement is about 37.9 % at continental scale, and the disparate proportion even exceeds 50 % in approximately 1/3 of the countries at national scale. We further found that there is a strong and significant correlation between spatial agreement and cropland fragmentation, suggesting that regions with higher landscape fragmentation generally have larger disparities. It is also noticed that places with better consistency are mainly distributed in regions with favorable natural environments and sufficient agricultural management such as well-developed irrigated technology. Proportions of complete agreement are thus located in favorable climate zones including Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), Subtropical highland climate (Cwb), and Temperate Mediterranean climate (Csb). The level of complete agreement keeps rising as the proportion of irrigated cropland increases. Spatial agreement among these datasets has the most significant relationship with cropland fragmentation, and a relatively small association with irrigation area, followed by climate conditions. These results can provide some insights into understanding how different factors influence the consistency of cropland datasets, and making an appropriate selection when using these datasets in different regions. We suggest that future cropland mapping activities should put more effort in those regions with significant disagreement in Sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Assessment of urban heat island warming in the greater accra region
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greater Accra region is the most urbanized region in Ghana. Over the last decade, the region has undergone rapid population shift and urban sprawl. This has modified the natural environment of the area and led to the formation and warming of Urban Heat Island (UHI). Previous studies have not established enough evidence on the existence of UHI phenomenon in the region. For this reason, this study examined the existence, magnitude, and spatial extent of UHI warming as well as its effect on temperature extremes in the region. The study used Landsat satellite imagery captured in 1991, 2002 and 2017, and in-situ daily minimum and maximum temperature data spanning the period 1980 to 2017. The satellite images were processed and analyzed using an integrated Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing technique while extreme temperature indices were assessed with the ClimPACT2 software. The study found that UHI existed in the region with an increasing spatial coverage and a magnitude of about 4.07 degrees C, 5.79 degrees C, and 4.86 degrees C in 1991, 2002, and 2017 respectively. The built-up and bare land areas experienced the strongest effect of UHI warming. In addition, enhanced UHI warming effect caused an increase in the frequency and intensity of warm temperature extremes in the region. A faster increase in night time temperatures than day time resulted in a decrease in diurnal temperature range of the region. Considering the high rate of warming amidst rapid urban expansion, more warming is expected in the region. This is expected to exacerbate climate extreme events and weather-related health issues. It is also expected to increase energy consumption, air pollution and human discomfort. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Media Representations of Religion, Spirituality and Non-Religion in Australia
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite predictions of decline, religion has featured prominently in the public sphere and the media since the events of 11 September 2001. Previous research on media and religion in Australia post-September 11 has focused largely on its negative impacts, particularly on Muslim communities. This article, in contrast, examines media representations of religion, spirituality and non-religion on an 'ordinary day', of 17 September, over a three-year period in the city of Melbourne. Its findings reveal that religion, in its myriad forms, permeates many aspects of Australian public life, but in ways which do not always reflect the actual religious composition and lived experiences of worldview diversity in Australia.

TI  - Application of a Nighttime Fog Detection Method Using SEVIRI Over an Arid Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fog degrades horizontal visibility causing significant adverse impacts on transport systems. The detection of fog from satellite data remains challenging especially in the presence of higher clouds, dust, mist, or unknown underlying soil conditions. Observations from Meteosat second generation Spinning-Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG SEVIRI) over the United Arab Emirates (UAE), an arid area on the Arabian Peninsula, from 2016 to 2018 (two fog seasons) are used in this study. We implement an adaptive threshold-based technique using pseudo-emissivity values to detect nocturnal fog from SEVIRI. The method allows the threshold to vary spatially and temporally. Low clouds are detected with the analysis of the vertical temperature gradient. Fog classification was verified against four stations in the UAE, namely Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Al Ain, and Al Maktoum, where visibility and meteorological observations are available. The probability of detection (POD) (false alarm ratio (FAR)) was 0.81 (0.40), 0.83 (0.50), 0.83 (0.33), and 0.77 (0.44) at Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Al Ain, and Al Maktoum, respectively. In addition, the spatial frequency of fog is presented, which provides new insights into the fog dynamics in the region.

TI  - A Quarter of Participants With Advanced Neoplasia Have Discordant Results From 2-Sample Fecal Immunochemical Tests for Colorectal Cancer Screening
T2  - CLINICAL GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs use 2-sample fecal immunochemical tests (FITs). We aimed to assess advanced neoplasia (AN) yield of 2 different FIT assays performed on the same bowel movement and have discordant results.METHODS: We conducted a large prospective comparative accuracy study within the Dutch national CRC screening program to evaluate 2 quantitative FIT assays (FOB-Gold, Sentinel, Italy and OC-Sensor, Eiken, Japan) with comparable performance characteristics. We asked 42,179 screening-naive individuals, 55-75 years old, to perform both tests on the same bowel movement, from May 2016 through March 2017. Participants with >= 1 positive test result (>= 15 mg hemoglobin/gram feces) were invited for colonoscopy examination. Detection of AN by colonoscopy was the reference standard.RESULTS: A total of 21,078 participants (50% participation rate) were included. FIT results were both negative for 19,032 participants (90%), both positive for 1163 participants (5.5%), and discordant for 883 participants (4.2%). AN was detected in 500 participants with 2 positive FIT results (43%) compared to 187 with discordant FIT results (21%) (p <.001). Of the 687 participants found to have AN by colonoscopy, 187 had only 1 positive FIT result (27%).CONCLUSION: In a large 2-sample FIT-based CRC screening study, more than a quarter of participants in whom AN was detected by colonoscopy in the first screening round had discordant FIT results. AN was detected in one-fifth of those with FIT discordance. Participants with discordant results from 2 FITs should undergo colonoscopy.

TI  - Optical Detection of the 1.1 day Variability at the White Dwarf GD 394 with TESS
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent discoveries have demonstrated that planetary systems routinely survive the post-main-sequence evolution of their host stars, leaving the resulting white dwarf with a rich circumstellar environment. Among the most intriguing of such hosts is the hot white dwarf GD 394, exhibiting a unique 1.150 0.003 day flux variation detected in Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) observations in the mid-1990s. The variation has eluded a satisfactory explanation, but hypotheses include channeled accretion producing a dark spot of metals, occultation by a gas cloud from an evaporating planet, or heating from a flux tube produced by an orbiting iron-cored planetesimal. We present observations obtained with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) of GD 394. The space-based optical photometry demonstrates a 0.12 0.01% flux variation with a period of 1.146 0.001 days, consistent with the EUVE period and the first re-detection of the flux variation outside of the extreme ultraviolet. We describe the analysis of the TESS light curve and measurement of the optical variation, and discuss the implications of our results for the various physical explanations put forward for the variability of GD 394.

TI  - Telecoupling mechanism of urban land expansion based on transportation accessibility: A case study of transitional Yangtze River economic Belt, China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies have explored the drivers of urban land expansion (ULE), but disregarded the influence of distant spatial effect on ULE at a large regional scale. This study contributed to a tele-coupling relationship framework between spatial spillover of ULE and transportation accessibility to find the influence of distance spatial effect on ULE. Drawing upon land-use remote sensing data from 1990-2015 and transportation network data, this study assessed the relationship between transportation accessibility and ULE, and developed a second-order spatial autoregressive model (SO-SAR) to explore the spatial spillover mechanism of ULE in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). The results find that ULE exhibits a significantly positive spatial correlation when the connection criterion of accessibility is 2 h <= hour <= 3h The SO-SAR model results show that ULE is affected by the historical ULE, which presents a significant path-dependence effect. Moreover, the ULE in most local cities has a weak inhibition on the ULE of the surrounding cities where the connection criterion of accessibility is 1 h. However, the spillover effects of remote city's ULE have a slight positive impact on local ULE due to the improvement of traffic accessibility from 2005 to 2015. In addition, openness, labor flows, institutional hierarchy, and economic structure had a significantly positive effect on ULE during the period 1990-2015 in the YREB. Policy reforms are suggested to encourage the development of integrated transportation and urban land use at a large regional scale in China. Moreover, there is a need for a mindset shift from cities competing competition over land to cooperation between the cities in YREB.

TI  - Inter-comparison of remote sensing platforms for height estimation of mango and avocado tree crowns
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To support the adoption of precision agricultural practices in horticultural tree crops, prior research has investigated the relationship between crop vigour (height, canopy density, health) as measured by remote sensing technologies, to fruit quality, yield and pruning requirements. However, few studies have compared the accuracy of different remote sensing technologies for the estimation of tree height. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy, flexibility, aerial coverage and limitations of five techniques to measure the height of two types of horticultural tree crops, mango and avocado trees. Canopy height estimates from Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) were used as a reference dataset against height estimates from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data, WorldView-3 (WV-3) stereo imagery, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based RGB and multi-spectral imagery, and field measurements. Overall, imagery obtained from the UAV platform were found to provide tree height measurement comparable to that from the TLS (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.19 m and rRMSE = 5.37 % for mango trees; R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 0.42 m and rRMSE = 4.75 % for avocado trees), although coverage area is limited to 1-10 km(2) due to battery life and line-of-sight flight regulations. The ALS data also achieved reasonable accuracy for both mango and avocado trees (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 0.24 m and rRMSE = 7.39 % for mango trees; R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.43 m and rRMSE = 5.04 % for avocado trees), providing both optimal point density and flight altitude, and therefore offers an effective platform for large areas (10 km(2)-100 km(2)). However, cost and availability of ALS data is a consideration. WV-3 stereo imagery produced the lowest accuracies for both tree crops (R-2 = 0.50, RMSE = 0.84 m and rRMSE = 32.64 % for mango trees; R-2 = 0.45, RMSE = 0.74 m and rRMSE = 8.51 % for avocado trees) when compared to other remote sensing platforms, but may still present a viable option due to cost and commercial availability when large area coverage is required. This research provides industries and growers with valuable information on how to select the most appropriate approach and the optimal parameters for each remote sensing platform to assess canopy height for mango and avocado trees.

TI  - The Reliability of Global Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration Products over Amazon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a key component of terrestrial water cycle, evapotranspiration (ET), specifically over the Amazon River basin, is of high scientific significance. However, due to the sparse observation network and relatively short observational period of eddy covariance data, large uncertainties remain in the spatial-temporal characteristics of ET over the Amazon. Recently, a great number of long-term global remotely sensed ET products have been developed to fill the observation gap. However, the reliabilities of these global ET products over the Amazon are unknown. In this study, we assessed the consistency of the magnitude, trend and spatial pattern of Amazon ET among five global remotely sensed ET reconstructions. The magnitudes of these products are similar but the long-term trends from 1982 to 2011 are completely divergent. Validation from the eddy covariance data and water balance method proves a better performance of a product grounded on local measurements, highlighting the importance of local measurements in the ET reconstruction. We also examined four hypotheses dealing with the response of ET to brightening, warming, greening and deforestation, which shows that in general, these ET products respond better to warming and greening than to brightening and deforestation. This large uncertainty highlights the need for future studies focusing on ET issues over the Amazon.

TI  - Improving the Accuracy of Binarized Neural Networks and Application on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep neural networks are well known to achieve outstanding results in many domains. Recently, many researchers have introduced deep neural networks into remote sensing (RS) data processing. However, typical RS data usually possesses enormous scale. Processing RS data with deep neural networks requires a rather demanding computing hardware. Most high-performance deep neural networks are associated with highly complex network structures with many parameters. This restricts their deployment for real-time processing in satellites. Many researchers have attempted overcoming this obstacle by reducing network complexity. One of the promising approaches able to reduce network computational complexity and memory usage dramatically is network binarization. In this letter, through analyzing the learning behavior of binarized neural networks (BNNs), we propose several novel strategies for improving the performance of BNNs. Empirical experiments prove these strategies to be effective in improving BNN performance for image classification tasks on both small- and large-scale data sets. We also test BNN on a remote sense data set with positive results. A detailed discussion and preliminary analysis of the strategies used in the training are provided.

TI  - Research Progress on the Early Monitoring of Pine Wilt Disease Using Hyperspectral Techniques
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Pine wilt disease (PWD) caused by pine wood nematode (PWN,Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) originated in North America and has since spread to Asia and Europe. PWN is currently a quarantine object in 52 countries. In recent years, pine wilt disease has caused considerable economic losses to the pine forest production industry in China, as it is difficult to control. Thus, one of the key strategies for controlling pine wilt disease is to identify epidemic points as early as possible. The use of hyperspectral cameras mounted on drones is expected to enable PWD monitoring over large areas of forest, and hyperspectral images can reflect different stages of PWD. The trend of applying hyperspectral techniques to the monitoring of pine wilt disease is analyzed, and the corresponding strategies to address the existing technical problems are proposed, such as data collection of early warning stages, needs of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and establishment of models after preprocessing.

TI  - Understanding the Land Surface Phenology and Gross Primary Production of Sugarcane Plantations by Eddy Flux Measurements, MODIS Images, and Data-Driven Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane (complex hybrids ofSaccharumspp., C4 plant) croplands provide cane stalk feedstock for sugar and biofuel (ethanol) production. It is critical for us to analyze the phenology and gross primary production (GPP) of sugarcane croplands, which would help us to better understand and monitor the sugarcane growing condition and the carbon cycle. In this study, we combined the data from two sugarcane EC flux tower sites in Brazil and the USA, images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, and data-driven models to study the phenology and GPP of sugarcane croplands. The seasonal dynamics of climate, vegetation indices from MODIS images, and GPP from two sugarcane flux tower sites (GPP(EC)) reveal the temporal consistency in sugarcane phenology (crop calendar: green-up dates and harvesting dates) as estimated by the vegetation indices and GPP(EC)data. The Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) is shown to be useful to delineate the phenology of sugarcane croplands. The relationship between the sugarcane GPP(EC)and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is stronger than the relationship between the GPP(EC)and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We ran the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), which uses the light use efficiency (LUE) concept and is driven by climate data and MODIS images, to estimate the daily GPP at the two sugarcane sites (GPP(VPM)). The seasonal dynamics of the GPP(VPM)and GPP(EC)at the two sites agreed reasonably well with each other, which indicates that VPM is a powerful tool for estimating the GPP of sugarcane croplands in Brazil and the USA. This study clearly highlights the potential of combining eddy covariance technology, satellite-based remote sensing technology, and data-driven models for better understanding and monitoring the phenology and GPP of sugarcane croplands under different climate and management practices.

TI  - Learning to Translate for Cross-Source Remote Sensing Image Retrieval
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Content-based remote sensing image retrieval (CBRSIR) is one of the important techniques for the mining and analysis of big remote sensing data. Recently, unified-source CBRSIR (US-CBRSIR) has been extensively studied and explored, but there has been little attention on cross-source CBRSIR (CS-CBRSIR). Although there is motivation for exploration of CS-CBRSIR for the continually increasing multisource remote sensing data, CS-CBRSIR suffers data drift due to multisource data. In this article, we explore to explicitly address the problem by mapping the source domain to target domain and propose an image translation-based framework for CS-CBRSIR. On the one hand, a novel cycle-identity-generative adversarial network (CI-GAN) is proposed based on the cycle-GAN. In addition to the generator and discriminator, a pretrained classifier, identity module, is designed to further boost the discriminative ability of translated images and facilitate the implementation of feature extraction and similarity measure. On the other hand, to alleviate the impact of style difference between the generated and real images, translated image augmentations and label smoothing regularization (LSR) are adopted to enhance training and contribute toward generation of a robust feature extractor. Extensive experiments on a public data set and a detailed ablation study confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

TI  - An Improved Traffic Congestion Monitoring System Based on Federated Learning
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study introduces a software-based traffic congestion monitoring system. The transportation system controls the traffic between cities all over the world. Traffic congestion happens not only in cities, but also on highways and other places. The current transportation system is not satisfactory in the area without monitoring. In order to improve the limitations of the current traffic system in obtaining road data and expand its visual range, the system uses remote sensing data as the data source for judging congestion. Since some remote sensing data needs to be kept confidential, this is a problem to be solved to effectively protect the safety of remote sensing data during the deep learning training process. Compared with the general deep learning training method, this study provides a federated learning method to identify vehicle targets in remote sensing images to solve the problem of data privacy in the training process of remote sensing data. The experiment takes the remote sensing image data sets of Los Angeles Road and Washington Road as samples for training, and the training results can achieve an accuracy of about 85%, and the estimated processing time of each image can be as low as 0.047 s. In the final experimental results, the system can automatically identify the vehicle targets in the remote sensing images to achieve the purpose of detecting congestion.

TI  - Automatic Extraction of Open Water Using Imagery of Landsat Series
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Open surface freshwater is an important resource for terrestrial ecosystems. However, climate change, seasonal precipitation cycling, and anthropogenic activities add high variability to its availability. Thus, timely and accurate mapping of open surface water is necessary. In this study, a methodology based on the concept of spatial autocorrelation was developed for automatic water extraction from Landsat series images using Taihu Lake in south-eastern China as an example. The results show that this method has great potential to extract continuous open surface water automatically, even when the water surface is covered by floating vegetation or algal blooms. The results also indicate that the second shortwave-infrared band (SWIR2) band performs best for water extraction when water is turbid or covered by surficial vegetation. Near-infrared band (NIR), first shortwave-infrared band (SWIR1), and SWIR2 have consistent extraction success when the water surface is not covered by vegetation. Low filter image processing greatly overestimated extracted water bodies, and cloud and image salt and pepper issues have a large impact on water extraction using the methods developed in this study.

TI  - Airborne High-Spectral-Resolution Lidar for Atmospheric Aerosol Detection
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol optical parameters can be quantitatively observed with high precision using a high-spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) without considering the lidar ratio. In this study, an airborne HSRI, was developed to observe the optical characteristics of aerosols and lidar was used for performing airborne observation experiments. Herein, the aerosol optical parameter inversion algorithm was improved accordingly. The experimental data of different flight areas and different flights were selected for inversion. Subsequently, the aerosol characteristics were analyzed by combining the solar photometer, hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory model, and satellite data. The analysis results denote obvious differences among the values of the aerosol optical parameters in different regions. The aerosol extinction coefficient exceeds 1.2 km(-1) in areas with frequent human activities such as towns and factories. The lidar ratio varies significantly with the altitude, and its maximum value is 60 sr. The aerosol optical depth is concentrated between 0.7 and 1 in the altitude from 0 to 3 km. In mountainous and marine areas, the aerosol extinction coefficient is concentrated in the range of 0. 2 to 0. 8 km(-1); further, the lidar ratio varies only slightly with the altitude and is concentrated between 5 and 30 sr. The aerosol optical thickness is concentrated between 0.3 and 0.7 in the interval from 0 to 3 km. Furthermore, the aerosol distribution is affected by the meteorological conditions, such as the wind and weather conditions, as well as the pollution processes; the optical characteristics of the aerosols in the same area on different dates arc affected by various factors, including the movement and diffusion of atmospheric pollutants.

TI  - Can Data Mining Help Eddy Covariance See the Landscape? A Large-Eddy Simulation Study
T2  - BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Eddy-covariance fluxes serve as an essential benchmark for Earth system models and remote sensing data. However, two challenges prevent model-data intercomparisons from fully utilizing eddy-covariance fluxes. The first challenge stems from the differing and variable spatial representativeness of the eddy-covariance measurements, or footprint bias and transience. The second originates from the phenomenon of a non-closed energy balance using eddy-covariance measurements, hypothesized to result from unaccounted mesoscale flows or under-sampling of hot spots by flux towers, among others. Previous studies have suggested that these two problems can be mitigated by either building multiple towers or by applying space-time rectification approaches, such as the environmental response function (ERF) approach. Here we ask: (1) How many eddy-flux towers do we need to sufficiently rectify location bias, close the energy budget, and sample the regional domain? (2) Can an advanced space-time rectification approach reduce the tower density, while still adequately sampling the regional flux domain? Furthermore, (3) How accurately can the ERF approach retrieve the surface-flux variation? To answer these questions, we used data from a large-eddy simulation of atmospheric flows above a heterogeneous surface as captured by an ensemble of virtual tower measurements. We calculated eddy-covariance fluxes by spatial and spatio-temporal methods. The spatial eddy-covariance method captured 89% of the prescribed total surface energy flux with about one tower per 15 km(2), while the spatio-temporal method required only one tower per 40 km(2) to capture 95% of surface energy. To capture 97% of energy, applying the ERF approach further reduced the required tower density to one tower per 200 km(2), as a result of space-time rectification and incorporating mesoscale flows. This approach also enabled retrieving the surface spatial variation of the sensible heat flux. The results provide a reference for informing and designing future observation systems based on flux tower clusters, and scale-aware data products.

TI  - Narrow-to-Broadband Conversion for Albedo Estimation on Urban Surfaces by UAV-Based Multispectral Camera
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban surface albedo is important for investigating urban surface-atmosphere radiative heat exchanges. For modeling surface energy balance (SEB) at local and neighborhood scales, ground or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral remote sensing (RS) can be used to obtain high-spatial-resolution multispectral information for both horizontal and vertical urban surfaces. The existing narrow-to-broadband (NTB) conversion models, developed for satellite/high-altitude observation and large homogeneous rural/vegetated/snow zones, may not be suitable for downscaling to the local and neighborhood scales or the urban complex texture. We developed three NTB models following published methodologies for three common UAV-based multispectral cameras according to Sample_D, a sample group of extensive spectral albedos of artificial urban surfaces, and evaluated their performance and sensitivities to solar conditions and surface material class. The proposed models were validated with independent samples (Sample_V). A model considering albedo physics was improved by multiplying different variables with respect to the camera (termed as "Model_phy_reg"), which initially proved to be the most accurate with a root mean square error of up to 0.02 for Sample_D and approximately 0.029 for Sample_V, meeting the required accuracy of total shortwave albedo for SEB modeling. The accuracy of Model_phy_reg was not much prone to the solar conditions.

TI  - Inversion and Analysis of Mining Subsidence by Integrating DInSAR, Offset Tracking, and PIM Technology
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-intensity underground mining generates considerable surface subsidence in mining areas, including ground cracks and collapse pits on roads and farmland, threatening the safety of buildings. Large-amplitude subsidence (e.g., >2 m) is usually characterized by a large phase gradient in interferograms, leading to severe phase decorrelation and unwrapping errors. Therefore, the subsidence on the surface cannot be well derived simply using conventional differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) or other geodetic measurements. We propose a new method that combines both DInSAR and subpixel offset-tracking technology to improve mine subsidence monitoring over large areas. We utilize their respective advantages to extract both the spatial boundaries and the amplitude of displacements. Using high-resolution RADARSAT-2 SAR images (5 m) acquired on February 13, 2012, and November 27, 2012, in the Shendong Coalfield located at the border between Shaanxi Province and Inner Mongolia Province, China, we obtain the subcentimetre-level subsidence of the mine boundary by DInSAR and resolve the metre-level mine subsidence centre based on subpixel offset tracking. The whole subsidence field is obtained by combining and analyzing the subcentimetre-level and the metre-level subsidence. We use the probability integral method (PIM) function model to fit the boundary and central mine subsidence to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the mine subsidence. Our results show that the maximum central subsidence reaches similar to 4.0 m (beyond the monitoring capabilities of DInSAR), which is generally in agreement with the maximum subsidence of similar to 4.0-5.0 m from field investigation. We also model the boundary and the central subsidence (the final fitting coefficient is 0.978). Our findings indicate that the offset-tracking method can compensate for the deficiency of DInSAR in large-amplitude subsidence extraction, and the inclusion of the PIM technique helps reconstruct the whole subsidence field in mining areas.

TI  - Coseismic Displacements and Surface Fractures from Sentinel-1 InSAR: 2019 Ridgecrest Earthquakes
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar is an important tool for imaging surface deformation from large continental earthquakes. Here, we present maps of coseismic displacement and strain from the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes using multiple Sentinel-1 images. We provide three types of interferometric products. (1) Standard interferograms from two look directions provide an overview of the deformation and can be used for modeling coseismic slip. (2) Phase gradient maps from stacks of coseismic interferograms provide high-resolution (similar to 30 m) images of strain concentration and surface fracturing that can be used to guide field surveys. (3) High-pass filtered, stacked, unwrapped phase is decomposed into east-west and up-down, south-north components and is used to determine the sense of fault slip. The resulting phase gradient maps reveal over 300 surface fractures, including triggered slip on the Garlock fault. The eastwest component of high-pass filtered phase reveals the polarity of the strike-slip offset (right lateral or left lateral) for many of the fractures. We find a small number of fractures that have slip polarity that is retrograde to the background tectonic stress. This is similar to observations of retrograde slip observed near the 1999 M-w 7.1 Hector Mine rupture, but the Ridgecrest observations are more completely imaged by the frequent and high-quality acquisitions from the twin Sentinel-1 spacecrafts. Determining whether the retrograde features are triggered slip on existing faults, or compliant fault deformation in response to stress changes from the Ridgecrest earthquakes, or new Coulombstyle failures, will require additional field work, modeling, and analysis.

TI  - Stratifying Forest Overstory for Improving Effective LAI Estimation Based on Aerial Imagery and Discrete Laser Scanning Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping forest effective leaf area index (LAIe) at the landscape level is a crucial step to better simulate various ecological and physiological processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, and precipitation interception. The LAIe products obtained from two-dimensional (2-D) remotely sensed optical imageries are usually biased due to their inability to identify the vertical forest structure and eliminate the effects of forest background (i.e., shrubs, grass, snow, and bare earth). In this study, we first stratified the forest overstory and background layers and generated a forest background mask layer based on the structural information implicitly contained within the aerial laser scanning (ALS) data. We improved the retrieval accuracy of LAIe by combining light detection and ranging (Lidar)-based three dimensional (3-D) structural and 2-D spectral information. Then, we obtained the improved final LAIe estimation result by masking the forest background pixels from the optical remotely sensed imageries. Our results showed that: (1) Removing forest background information could effectively (R(2)increase from 20% to 30%) improve the estimation accuracy of optical-based forest LAIe depending on forest structure characteristics. (2) The forest background in the forest stands with low canopy cover showed more apparent effects on LAIe estimation compared with the forest stands with a high canopy cover. (3) The combination of ALS and optical remotely sensed data could produce the best LAIe retrieval result effectively by removing the forest background information.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A 43 -year-old woman presented to the hospital with a right breast tumor. She had been treated for human immunodeficiency virus(HIV)infection for 5 years. After being diagnosed with right breast cancer, she underwent total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, which indicated T2N1M0 triple-negative breast cancer. She received doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide( AC)followed by docetaxel(AC-T)as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. However, 14 months after the adjuvant chemotherapy finished, distant metastasis occurred in the brain, lung, and mediastinum lymph nodes. Treatment for relapse was initiated, with whole brain radiotherapy followed by paclitaxel plus bevacizumab combination therapy(PB); however, new metastatic lesions were found in the bone, liver, and mediastinum lymph node after 2 courses of PB. Given the risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, a BRCAgene test was performed when the patient received radiotherapy for left recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis caused by mediastinal lymph nodes; this showed a result positive for a deleterious mutation in BRCA1. Thus, treatment with olaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase(PARP)inhibitor, was started. Metastatic lesions, including barky growth, in the liver metastasis were well controlled, as confirmed by CT imaging 4 months after the start of olaparib.

TI  - Post-Wildfire Surface Deformation Near Batagay, Eastern Siberia, Detected by L-Band and C-Band InSAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Thawing of ice-rich permafrost and subsequent ground subsidence can form characteristic landforms, and the resulting topography they create is collectively called "thermokarst." The impact of wildfire on thermokarst development remains uncertain. Here, we report on the post-wildfire ground deformation associated with the 2014 wildfire near Batagay, Eastern Siberia. We used Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to generate both long-term (1-4 years) and short-term (subseasonal to seasonal) deformation maps. Based on two independent satellite-based microwave sensors, we could validate the dominance of vertical displacements and their heterogeneous distributions without relying on in situ data. The inferred time series based on L-band ALOS2 InSAR data indicated that the cumulative subsidence at the area of greatest magnitude was greater than 30 cm from October 2015 to June 2019 and that the rate of subsidence slowed in 2018. The burn severity was rather homogeneous, but the cumulative subsidence magnitude was larger on the east-facing slopes where the gullies were also predominantly developed. The correlation suggests that the active layer on the east-facing slopes might have been thinner before the fire. Meanwhile, C-band Sentinel-1 InSAR data with higher temporal resolution showed that the temporal evolution included episodic changes in terms of deformation rate. Moreover, we could unambiguously detect frost heave signals that were enhanced within the burned area during the early freezing season but were absent in the mid-winter. We could reasonably interpret the frost heave signals within a framework of premelting theory instead of assuming a simple freezing and subsequent volume expansion of preexisting pore water.

TI  - Comparison of land surface and air temperatures for quantifying summer and winter urban heat island in a snow climate city
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect is an increasingly consequential problem that confronts cities. The accurate characterization and quantification of UHI are crucial for sustainable urban development. Few UHI studies, however, compare data source, spatio-temporal variations, and indicators for the same city in parallel. This study uses Changchun, a snow climate city in China, as an example and compares five different indicators of the UHI based on land surface temperature (LST) derived from Landsat 8 TIRS and hourly air temperature (AT) collected from 41 meteorological weather stations to conduct a more comprehensive comparative study of the UHI. The results show the following. (1) The relationships between LST and AT are all statistically significant, and the surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensity characterized by the LST is considerably stronger than that of AT both in summer and winter. (2) The SUHI intensity is significantly stronger in summer (6.83 degrees C) than in winter (1.55 degrees C) based on the morning LST, whereas the UHI intensity (0.27 degrees C in summer and 0.40 degrees C in winter) that is simultaneously quantified by the AT has an opposite result. The mean whole-day and daytime UHI intensity difference, which is quantified hourly by the AT between summer and winter, is not significant. The difference between nighttime and daytime UHI intensities is evident in both summer (1.26 degrees C) and winter (0.76 degrees C). Additionally, the high temperatures for both LST and AT have a more concentrated distribution in winter than in summer. (3) The values of UHI/SUHI intensity considerably vary based on different indicators. The different choices among land covers to represent "urban" and "rural" areas would significantly affect the values of UHI/SUHI intensity. The selection of appropriate indicators and data sources to quantify the UHI remains a problem that has to be resolved in future studies.

TI  - Seasonal Variability of Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient in the Pearl River Estuary from Long-Term Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated six empirical and semianalytical models of the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d(490)) using an in situ dataset collected in the Pearl River estuary (PRE). A combined model with the most accurate performance (correlation coefficient,R-2= 0.92) was selected and applied for long-term estimation from 2003 to 2017. Physical and biological processes in the PRE over the 14-year period were investigated by applying satellite observations (MODIS/Aqua data) and season-reliant empirical orthogonal function analysis (S-EOF). In winter, the averageK(d)(490) was significantly higher than in the other three seasons. A slight increasing trend was observed in spring and summer, whereas a decreasing trend was observed in winter. In summer, a tongue with a relatively highK(d)(490) was found in southeastern Lingdingyang Bay. In Eastern Guangdong province (GDP), the relatively higherK(d)(490) value was found in autumn and winter. Based on the second mode of S-EOF, we found that the higher values in the eastern GDP extended westward and formed a distinguishable tongue in winter. The grey relational analysis revealed that chlorophyll-a concentration (C-chla) and total suspended sediment concentration (C-tsm) were two dominant contributors determining the magnitude ofK(d)(490) values. TheC(tsm)-dominated waters were generally located in coastal and estuarine turbid waters; theC(chla)-dominated waters were observed in open clear ocean. The distribution of constituents-dominated area was different in the four seasons, which was affected by physical forces, including wind field, river runoff, and sea surface temperature.

TI  - On the cutting force of micro-textured polycrystalline cubic boron nitride cutting tool for powder metallurgy materials
T2  - ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Micro-textured cutting tools were widely reported due to the improved cutting performance, for example, the reduction of cutting forces. However, the cutting performance is significantly dependent on the parameters of the micro-textures. In this work, some polycrystalline cubic boron nitride tools with designed circular micro-textures were designed and manufactured by laser processing technology, and used to machine powder metallurgy materials. The effect of micro-texture parameters (diameter, depth and density) on the cutting forces (F-X, F-Y, F(Z)andF(r)) was studied by an orthogonal test, the effect of cutting velocity on the cutting force was also studied. The results have shown that the pit diameter and depth have more significant effect on the cutting forces than the cutting velocity and pit density. As compared with the non-textured tools, the textured tools can effectively reduce the cutting forces and the optimal cutting forces were achieved at parameters as 230 mu m for diameter, 90 mu m for depth, 20% for density and 110 m/min for cutting velocity. The present findings are of significance for the design of polycrystalline cubic boron nitride cutting tools and the processing of powder metallurgy materials.

TI  - Validation of Sentinel-3A/3B and Jason-3 Altimeter Wind Speeds and Significant Wave Heights Using Buoy and ASCAT Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study validated wind speed (WS) and significant wave height (SWH) retrievals from the Sentinel-3A/3B and Jason-3 altimeters for the period of data beginning 31 October 2019 (to 18 September 2019 for Jason-3) using moored buoy data and satellite Meteorological Operational Satellite Program (MetOp-A/B) Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) data. The spatial and temporal scales of the collocated data were 25 km and 30 min, respectively. The statistical metrics of root mean square error (RMSE), bias, correlation coefficient (R), and scatter index (SI) were used to validate the WS and SWH accuracy. Validation of WS against moored buoy data indicated errors of 1.19 m/s, 1.13 m/s and 1.29 m/s for Sentinel-3A, Sentinel-3B and Jason-3, respectively. The accuracy of Sentinel-3A/3B WS is better than that of Jason-3. All three altimeters underestimated WS slightly in comparison with the buoy data. Errors in WS at different speeds or SWHs increased slightly as WS or SWH increased. Over time, the accuracy of the Jason-3 altimeter-derived WS improved, whereas that of Sentinel-3A showed no temporal dependence. The WSs of the three altimeters were compared with ASCAT wind data for validation purposes over the global ocean without in situ measurements. On average, the WSs of the three altimeters were lower in comparison with the ASCAT data. The accuracy of the three altimeters was found to be consistent and stable at low/medium speeds but it decreased when the WS exceeded 15 m/s. Validations of SWH against buoy wave data indicated that the accuracy of Jason-3 SWH was better than that of Sentinel-3A/3B. However, the accuracy of all three altimeters decreased when the SWH exceeded 4 m. The accuracy of Sentinel-3A and Jason-3 SWH was temporally stable, whereas that of Sentinel-3B SWH improved over time. Analyses of SWH accuracy as a function of wave period showed that the Jason-3 altimeter was better than the Sentinel-3A/3B altimeters for long-period ocean waves. Generally, the accuracy of WS and SWH data derived by the Sentinel-3A/3B and Jason-3 altimeters satisfies their mission requirements. Overall, the accuracy of WS (SWH) derived by Sentinel-3A/3B (Jason-3) is better than that retrieved by Jason-3 (Sentinel-3A/3B).

TI  - A Robust Method for Generating High-Spatiotemporal-Resolution Surface Reflectance by Fusing MODIS and Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The methods for accurately fusing medium- and high-spatial-resolution satellite reflectance are vital for monitoring vegetation biomass, agricultural irrigation, ecological processes and climate change. However, the currently existing fusion methods cannot accurately capture the temporal variation in reflectance for heterogeneous landscapes. In this study, we proposed a new method, the spatial and temporal reflectance fusion method based on the unmixing theory and a fuzzy C-clustering model (FCMSTRFM), to generate Landsat-like time-series surface reflectance. Unlike other data fusion models, the FCMSTRFM improved the similarity of pixels grouped together by combining land cover maps and time-series data cluster algorithms to define endmembers. The proposed method was tested over a 2000 km(2)study area in Heilongjiang Provence, China, in 2017 and 2018 using ten images. The results show that the accuracy of the FCMSTRFM is better than that of the popular enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) (correlation coefficient (R): 0.8413 vs. 0.7589; root mean square error (RMSE): 0.0267 vs. 0.0401) and the spatial-temporal data fusion approach (STDFA) (R: 0.8413 vs. 0.7666; RMSE: 0.0267 vs. 0.0307). Importantly, the FCMSTRFM was able to maintain the details of temporal variations in complicated landscapes. The proposed method provides an alternative method to monitor the dynamics of land surface variables over complicated heterogeneous regions.

TI  - On the influence of sub-pixel position correction for PS localization accuracy and time series quality
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) is a time series remote sensing technique to estimate displacements of geo-objects from the interferometric phases of selected Persistent Scatterers (PS). The relative position of a scatterer within a resolution cell causes an additional phase contribution in the observed phase, which needs to be accounted for in PSI processing. Here we analyze the influence of this sub-pixel position correction on point localization and displacement quality. Apart from a theoretical evaluation, we perform experiments with TerraSAR-X, Radarsat-2, and Sentinel-1, demonstrating various levels of improvement. We show that the influence of the sub-pixel correction is significant for the geolocation of the scatterer (meter-level improvement), modest for the elevation estimation (centimeter-level improvement), and limited for the displacement estimation (submillimeter-level). For displacement velocities, we find variations of a few tenths of a millimeter per year. The effect of sub-pixel correction is most dominant for large orbital baselines and short time series.

TI  - Monthly estimation of the surface water extent in France at a 10-m resolution using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The first national product of Surface Water Dynamics in France (SWDF) is generated on a monthly temporal scale and 10-m spatial scale using an automatic rule-based superpixel (RBSP) approach. The current surface water dynamic products from high resolution (HR) multispectral satellite imagery are typically analyzed to determine the annual trend and related seasonal variability. Annual and seasonal time series analyses may fail to detect the infra-annual variations of water bodies. Sentinel-2 allows us to investigate water resources based on both spatial and temporal high-resolution analyses. We propose a new automatic RBSP approach on the Google Earth Engine platform. The RBSP method employs combined spectral indices and superpixel techniques to delineate the surface water extent; this approach avoids the need for training data and benefits large-scale, dynamic and automatic monitoring. We used the proposed RBSP method to process Sentinel-2 monthly composite images covering a two-year period and generate the monthly surface water extent at the national scale, i.e., over France. Annual occurrence maps were further obtained based on the pixel frequency in monthly water maps. The monthly dynamics provided in SWDF products are evaluated by HR satellite-derived water masks at the national scale (JRC GSW monthly water history) and at local scales (over two lakes, i.e., Lake Der-Chantecoq and Lake Orient, and 200 random sampling points). The monthly trends between SWDF and GSW were similar, with a coefficient of 0.94. The confusion matrix-based metrics based on the sample points were 0.885 (producer's accuracy), 0.963 (user's accuracy), 0.932 (overall accuracy) and 0.865 (Matthews correlation coefficient). The annual surface water extents (i.e., permanent and maximum) are validated by two HR satellite image-based water maps and an official database at the national scale and small water bodies (ponds) at the local scale at Loir-et-Cher. The results show that the SWDF results are closely correlated to the previous annual water extents, with a coefficient > 0.950. The SWDF results are further validated for large rivers and lakes, with extraction rates of 0.929 and 0.802, respectively. Also, SWDF exhibits superiority to GSW in small water body extraction (taking 2498 ponds in Loir-et-Cher as example), with an extraction rate improved by approximately 20%. Thus, the SWDF method can be used to study interannual, seasonal and monthly variations in surface water systems. The monthly dynamic maps of SWDF improved the degree of land surface coverage by 25% of France on average compared with GSW, which is the only product that provides monthly dynamics. Further harmonization of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 and the introduction of enhanced cloud detection algorithm can fill some gaps of no-data regions.

M3  - Article
AB  - ICESat-2 satellite data arc collected by a multi-beam photon-counting system, which greatly improves data coverage density and data accuracy. The forward-scattering effect caused by clouds and aerosols in the atmosphere significantly influences data accuracy. In this paper, an apparent surface reflectance-based cloud-detection algorithm using the pulse-folding characteristics of the ATLAS photon-counting system is proposed. The ICESat-2 cloud-detection process and its related algorithm arc described in detail, which will be helpful for the application and expansion of ICESat-2 data in studies of the atmosphere. The results will provide reference that will be of significance for the correction of subsequent atmospheric effects in laser altimetry acquired by Chinese satellites.

TI  - Variability in the management of agricultural fields spared for conservation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Private land conservation initiatives are primary channels for wildlife population recovery and management in agricultural ecosystems. Billions of dollars are allocated to these programs in the United States and Europe. Ensuring cost-efficiency is a top priority for funding agencies and substantial resources are dedicated to targeting enrolment to maximize environmental benefits. Landowner management of conservation fields can moderate environmental benefits and may undermine cost efficiency if done incorrectly, therefore it is important to accurately monitor and predict landowner compliance to contract specifications. We investigated landowner compliance to one key wildlife-friendly recommendation ("conformance") and the amount of woody encroachment in a grassland conservation program, the Kentucky Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. We used two methods to estimate conformance to wildlife-friendly mowing recommendations and woody encroachment: aerial surveys and supervised classification of satellite imagery. We fit a double observer binomial model to helicopter survey data to estimate impacts of landscape features (e.g., distance to road, field size) on mowing intensity and woody cover. We used the random forest algorithm in Google Earth Engine (n trees = 1000) to classify vegetation management from SPOT-6 and SPOT-7 satellite images. We surveyed 306 fields in February 2016 via helicopter and classified images from November 2015. At the field scale, estimates of mowed and woody vegetation from image classification were similar to observations from helicopter surveys (< 7% difference on average). Approximately 70% of contracts were conformant to wildlife-friendly recommendations. Most variation in mowing intensity and woody encroachment was random. Landscape features were not sufficient predictors of field management and landowners operated independently of one another. Our study is a potent example of how the mis-management of conservation parcels by landowners may diminish efforts to maximize environmental benefits. Resource management agencies that administer private land conservation should dedicate considerable resources to ensuring landowners follow best management practices. Using remote sensing technology is a viable method for surveying compliance at programmatic scales.

TI  - Measuring Accessibility to Various ASFs from Public Transit using Spatial Distance Measures in Indian Cities
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, accessibility to facilities is one of the most discussed issues in sustainable urban planning. In the current research, two spatial distance accessibility measures were applied to evaluate the accessibility to amenities, services, and facilities (ASFs) from public transit (PT) by walking distance in six Indian cities. The first stage accounts for distance measures using the Euclidean distance with a new methodical approach derived from the built-up area with a spatial resolution of 30 m from Landsat data, and for the network distance method, the actual road distances using OpenStreetMap (OSM) for different threshold ranges of distances were derived. Meanwhile, in the second stage, indicators such as built-up area, network connectivity, and network density with the percentage of ASFs are evaluated and combined for normalization process for ranking the city. The present study assesses the accessibility to various ASFs from PT at city level and explores whether the actual road network access (by measuring distance) in Indian cities is contributing to a high level of accessibility. It adopts a unique approach using statistical tools while assessing both Euclidean and network distances. It models a framework for overall benchmarking in all six cities by ranking them for their accessibility. The results show various scenarios in terms of the rank of cities, which had been strongly affected by distance metrics (Euclidean vs. network) and thus emphasize the careful use of these measures as supporting tools for planning. This facilitates the identification of the local barriers and problems with network access that affect the actual distance. This unique approach can help policymakers to identify the gaps in PT coverage for reaching ASFs. Furthermore, it helps in crucial implementation by strategic planning that can be achieved using these distance criteria.

TI  - Comparable analysis of bubble translation due to acoustic radiation force based on simultaneous acoustical and optical observation
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 40th Symposium on Ultrasonic Electronics (USE)
CL  - Meiji Univ Surugadai Campus, Acad Common, Tokyo, JAPAN
AB  - Contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging using acoustic radiation force, called contrast-enhanced active Doppler ultrasound (CEADUS) imaging, has been proposed for visualizing lymph channels filled with stationary fluid. Based on optical observations and acoustical evaluation, the behaviour of bubbles in a simulated channel during ultrasound exposure was investigated under four conditions for negative peak sound pressure (P-np), at centre frequency of ultrasound and pulse repetition frequency of 15 MHz and 1 kHz, respectively. There was good correlation between the time changes of mean translational velocity for optical evaluation (V-OPT) and acoustical evaluation (V-US). In addition, the maxima of V-OPT and V-US were correlated (R = 0.665) and showed a similar trend proportional to the square of Pnp. These results strongly suggest that the acoustically-evaluated bubble translation has information equal to optically-evaluated one, meaning that the simultaneous observation system is useful to understand the bubble behaviours under CEADUS imaging.

TI  - Sentinel interaction mapping-a generic approach for the functional analysis of human disease gene variants using yeast
T2  - DISEASE MODELS & MECHANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in sequencing technology have led to an explosion in the number of known genetic variants of human genes. A major challenge is to now determine which of these variants contribute to diseases as a result of their effect on gene function. Here, we describe a generic approach using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to quickly develop gene-specific in vivo assays that can be used to quantify the level of function of a genetic variant. Using synthetic dosage lethality screening, 'sentinel' yeast strains are identified that are sensitive to overexpression of a human disease gene. Variants of the gene can then be functionalized in a high throughput fashion through simple growth assays using solid or liquid media. Sentinel interaction mapping (SIM) has the potential to create functional assays for the large majority of human disease genes that do not have a yeast orthologue. Using the tumour suppressor gene PTEN as an example, we show that SIM assays can provide a fast and economical means to screen a large number of genetic variants.

TI  - Cloud Cover over the Arabian Peninsula from Global Remote Sensing and Reanalysis Products
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds - their coverage, nature, and interactions with the energy budget of the planet - represent one of the primary sources of uncertainty in future climate prediction. Despite the crucial role of desert clouds in the distribution of water and energy budgets, their climatology is still largely incomplete. With arid regions projected to become dryer under global warming conditions, understanding the characteristics of their cloud cover can provide critical insights. In this work, cloud coverage was investigated over one of the Earth's most arid regions - the Arabian Peninsula. Four total cloud cover (FCC) products, namely the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project H (ISCCP), the CM SAF Cloud, Albedo and Surface Radiation AVHRR 2 (CLARA) satellite datasets, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction - National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) Reanalysis (R-2) (NCEP) and the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA) reanalyses, were used to construct a climatology of desert clouds over the peninsula between 1984 and 2009, accounting for the different products' uncertainties and limitations. Satellite retrievals and reanalysis fields were first validated against ground observations from the United Arab Emirates, for which homogeneity assessments were conducted. The validation was done using statistical indicators, including Normalized Root Mean Square Errors (nRMSE), relative biases (rBIAS), and correlation coefficients, on monthly and seasonal scales. The ISCCP dataset resulted in the highest correlations with the ground observations (overall 0.38) and the lowest nRMSE (overall 0.54), while CLARA had the lowest rBIAS (overall 0.02). All products showed discrepancies when compared to the ground observations, both annually and on a seasonal basis. When extended to the entire Arabian Peninsula, the satellite and reanalysis products showed decreasing spring and increasing summer (except for ISCCP) TCC evolution across the region. At inter-annual scales, the TCC over the peninsula showed a significant discontinuity in 1998. This shift could be linked to the forcing of the El Nino Southern Oscillation on water vapor transport over the region, as well as to documented artifacts in satellite retrievals and model outputs. These discrepancies are indicative of a need for detailed assessments to be made of the uncertainties existing in TCC data for the Arabian Peninsula.Plain Language Summary: Clouds represent a primary source of uncertainty in future climate predictions. This is particularly pronounced in dryland clouds, given their sporadic and intermittent nature. With global warming predicted to enhance aridification trends in terrestrial arid zones, historical cloudiness trends over arid and hyper arid regions are very important - yet their climatology to date is still largely incomplete. The quality of observations and/or model outputs are an important consideration, making validation and intercomparison assessments imperative.This work investigated cloud cover over the Arabian Peninsula, one of the most arid regions on the Earth. Four cloud cover datasets were used, derived from satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis model outputs. The selected study period was between 1984 and 2009. The four datasets were initially compared with observations taken at ground stations in the United Arab Emirates. The four products were then studied over the entire Arabian Peninsula. Results showed that cloud cover displayed marked seasonal characteristics and large inter-annual temporal evolution. An abrupt change in regional cloud cover time series was found to occur in 1998. This could be attributed to the forcing of the El Nino Southern Oscillation, although significant documented uncertainties in satellite products over this time span call for deeper investigations of this causal relation.

TI  - An Effective Cloud Detection Method for Gaofen-5 Images via Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments in hyperspectral satellites have dramatically promoted the wide application of large-scale quantitative remote sensing. As an essential part of preprocessing, cloud detection is of great significance for subsequent quantitative analysis. For Gaofen-5 (GF-5) data producers, the daily cloud detection of hundreds of scenes is a challenging task. Traditional cloud detection methods cannot meet the strict demands of large-scale data production, especially for GF-5 satellites, which have massive data volumes. Deep learning technology, however, is able to perform cloud detection efficiently for massive repositories of satellite data and can even dramatically speed up processing by utilizing thumbnails. Inspired by the outstanding learning capability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, we propose a new dual-branch CNN architecture for cloud segmentation for GF-5 preview RGB images, termed a multiscale fusion gated network (MFGNet), which introduces pyramid pooling attention and spatial attention to extract both shallow and deep information. In addition, a new gated multilevel feature fusion module is also employed to fuse features at different depths and scales to generate pixelwise cloud segmentation results. The proposed model is extensively trained on hundreds of globally distributed GF-5 satellite images and compared with current mainstream CNN-based detection networks. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method has a higher F1 score (0.94) and fewer parameters (7.83 M) than the compared methods.

TI  - Forest Phenology Shifts in Response to Climate Change over China-Mongolia-Russia International Economic Corridor
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator of climate change. With the intensification of global warming, the changes in growing seasons of various vegetation types have been widely documented across the world. However, as one of the most vulnerable regions in response to the global climate change, the phenological responses and associated mechanisms in mid-high latitude forests are still not fully understood. In this study, long-term changes in forest phenology and the associated relationship with the temperature and snow water equivalent in the China-Mongolia-Russia International Economic Corridor were examined by analyzing the satellite-measured normalized difference vegetation index and the meteorological observation data during 1982 to 2015. The average start date of the growing season (SOS) of the forest ecosystem in our study area advanced at a rate of 2.5 days/decade, while the end date of the growing season (EOS) was delayed at a rate of 2.3 days/decade, contributing to a growing season that was approximately 15 days longer in the 2010s compared to that in 1980s. A higher April temperature is beneficial to the advance in the SOS, and a higher summer temperature has the potential to extend the EOS in the forest ecosystem. However, our results also suggest that a single temperature cannot fully explain the advance of the SOS, as well as the delay in the EOS. The preseason Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) is also an essential factor in influencing the growing season. A higher SWE in February and March and lower SWE in April tend to advance the SOS, while higher SWE in pre-year December and lower SWE in current year October are beneficial to the extension of the EOS.

TI  - A New Temperature Channel Selection Method Based on Singular Spectrum Analysis for Retrieving Atmospheric Temperature Profiles from FY-4A/GIIRS
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral data have important research and application value in the fields of meteorology and remote sensing. With the goal of improving retrievals of atmospheric temperature profiles, this paper outlines a novel temperature channel selection method based on singular spectrum analysis (SSA) for the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS), which is the first infrared sounder operating in geostationary orbit. The method possesses not only the simplicity and rapidity of the principal component analysis method, but also the interpretability of the conventional channel selection method. The novel SSA method is used to decompose the GIIRS observed infrared brightness temperature spectrum (700-1130 cm(-1)), and the reconstructed grouped components can be obtained to reflect the energy variations in the temperature-sensitive waveband of the respective sequence. At 700-780 cm(-1), the channels selected using our method perform better than IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) and CrIS (Cross-track Infrared Sounder) temperature channels when used as inputs to the neural network retrieval model.

T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing offers an effective and low-cost solution for mapping the extent of seagrasses and temporally monitoring them routinely. In an in-situ well-explored Gulbahce Bay test site, we used a high-resolution Sentinel-2 image to map the distribution of P. oceanica. Atmospheric and water column corrections were applied to the raw image. Thematic maps of the area were obtained by supervised classification and their accuracy was evaluated by cross-validation. The produced maps were also compared to a previously generated high accurate thematic map generated by the combination of sub-bottom profiler, side-scan sonar, and very high-resolution satellite image data. The classification achieved nearly 88% user accuracy at best. The assessment of the accuracy was also carried out in terms of water transparency. For this purpose, Secchi disk depths (SDDs) over the study area were inverted from the satellite-derived vertical attenuation coefficients by using a model. This model was retrieved by tuning the coefficients to 22 local SDD measurements. Sentinel-2 twin-satellite with its high spatial and temporal resolution data can contribute to mapping the P. oceanica cover in shallow waters. Their multispectral data can also be utilized for deriving the water transparency in order to determine the application limitations of the generated map.

TI  - Estimating fractional cover of crop, crop residue, and soil in cropland using broadband remote sensing data and machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The fractional vegetation cover (FVC), crop residue cover (CRC), and bare soil (BS) are three important parameters in vegetation-soil ecosystems, and their correct and timely estimation can improve crop monitoring and environmental monitoring. The triangular space method uses one CRC index and one vegetation index to create a triangular space in which the three vertices represent pure vegetation, crop residue, and bare soil. Subsequently, the CRC, FVC, and BS of mixed remote sensing pixels can be distinguished by their spatial locations in the triangular space. However, soil moisture and crop-residue moisture (SM-CRM) significantly reduce the performance of broadband remote sensing CRC indices and can thus decrease the accuracy of the remote estimation and mapping of CRC, FVC, and BS. This study evaluated the use of broadband remote sensing, the triangular space method, and the random forest (RF) technique to estimate and map the FVC, CRC, and BS of cropland in which SM-CRM changes dramatically. A spectral dataset was obtained using: (1) from a field-based experiment with a field spectrometer; and (2) from a laboratory-based simulation that included four distinct soil types, three types of crop residue (winter-wheat, maize, and rice), one crop (winter wheat), and varying SM-CRM. We trained an RF model [designated the broadband crop-residue index from random forest (CRRF)] that can magnify spectral features of crop residue and soil by using the broadband remote sensing angle indices as input, and uses a moisture-resistant hyperspectral index as the target. The effects of moisture on crop residue and soil were minimized by using the broadband CRRF. Then, the CRRF-NDVI triangular space method was used to estimate and map CRC, FVC, and BS. Our method was validated by using both laboratory- and field-based experiments and Sentinel-2 broadband remote-sensing images. Our results indicate that the CRRF-NDVI triangular space method can reduce the effect of moisture on the broadband remote-sensing of CRC, and may also help to obtain laboratory and field CRC, FVC, and BS. Thus, the proposed method has great potential for application to croplands in which the SM-CRM content changes dramatically.

TI  - THE REPRESENTATION OF THE CONCEPT OF MONEY IN THE RUSSIAN AND ENGLISH PROVERBIAL CORPUS
T2  - REVISTA INCLUSIONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern researchers in linguistics concentrate their research effort on the language-culture interaction and on the study of linguistic and cultural concepts. Proverbs epitomize folk culture and wisdom and reveal the mentality and worldview of an ethnos. Research studies of particular interest focus on detecting the conceptual and semantic content of the notion of money and on the comprehensive presentation of the content of proverbs illustrating the concept of MONEY in Russian and English linguistic consciousness. The definitional analysis was used to interpret the notion of money. The method of the frame classification of proverbs found a possible identification of the main 'meanings' of proverbs, and the cognitive, linguistic and cultural approaches to the study of proverbs were used to describe the concept of money and to demonstrate a series of lexemes representing it. The study revealed the universal and specific features of this concept related to Russian and English attitudes towards money. The frame classification, which specifies the values and cultural knowledge of a national sphere of concepts, reflects the semantic space of proverbs relating to the concept under investigation. The results of the research will be useful to researchers involved in the study of cognitive semantics, paremiology and cross-linguistic/cultural studies.

TI  - The darker angels of our nature: Do social worldviews mediate the associations that dark personality features have with ideological attitudes?
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present studies examined the associations that narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, sadism, and spitefulness had with the competitive and dangerous social worldviews as well as the possibility that these worldviews may explain, at least in part, the associations that these dark personality features had with the ideological attitudes of social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). Across three studies (N = 2,103), we found the dark personality features to be positively associated with the competitive social worldview in Studies 1 and 3 but these associations were much weaker in Study 2. Narcissism, psychopathy, and spitefulness had indirect associations with the dominance and anti-egalitarianism aspects of SDO through the competitive social worldview in Study 3 but not in Study 2. In contrast, the dark personality features had, at best, weak associations with the dangerous social worldview as well as divergent associations with aspects of RWA. More specifically, narcissism and spitefulness were positively associated with aspects of RWA but psychopathy was negatively associated with RWA. Discussion focuses on the role that social worldviews - especially perceptions of the world as being a highly competitive environment - may play in the connections that dark personality features have with various outcomes including ideological attitudes.

TI  - A New and Simplified Approach for Estimating the Daily River Discharge of the Tibetan Plateau Using Satellite Precipitation: An Initial Study on the Upper Brahmaputra River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Collecting in situ observations from remote, high mountain rivers presents major challenges, yet real-time, high temporal resolution (e.g., daily) discharge data are critical for flood hazard mitigation and river management. In this study, we propose a method for estimating daily river discharge (RD) based on free, operational remote sensing precipitation data (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), since 2001). In this method, an exponential filter was implemented to produce a new precipitation time series from daily basin-averaged precipitation data to model the time lag of precipitation in supplying RD, and a linear-regression relationship was constructed between the filtered precipitation time series and observed discharge records. Because of different time lags in the wet season (rainfall-dominant) and dry season (snowfall-dominant), the precipitation data were processed in a segmented way (from June to October and from November to May). The method was evaluated at two hydrological gauging stations in the Upper Brahmaputra (UB) river basin, where Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficients for Nuxia (>0.85) and Yangcun (>0.80) indicate good performance. By using the degree-day method to estimate the snowmelt and acquire the time series of new active precipitation (rainfall plus snowmelt) in the target basins, the discharge estimations were improved (NSE > 0.9 for Nuxia) compared to the original data. This makes the method applicable for most rivers on the Tibetan Plateau, which are fed mainly by precipitation (including snowfall) and are subject to limited human interference. The method also performs well for reanalysis precipitation data (Chinese Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD), 1980-2000). The real-time or historical discharges can be derived from satellite precipitation data (or reanalysis data for earlier historical years) by using our method.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of VIIRS daily snow cover product with MODIS for snow detection in China based on ground observations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatiotemporal information of snow cover not only is important for investigating the mechanisms of climate change but also greatly contributes to hydrological modelling in mountainous regions. The Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) (referred to as VNP) daily snow cover product is recently released and expected to take place of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products in near future. As an important addition to the widely used MODIS products, there is also an urgent need for a reliable accuracy evaluation and comparison of VNP for future large-scale daily snow cover mapping. This study for the first time evaluates the accuracy of VNP daily snow cover data in China using daily snow depth observations from 330 stations. The accuracy of VNP data is generally good with the averaged CK (Cohen's Kappa) and FS (F-Score) as high as 0.72 and 0.75, respectively, but considerably decreases to 0.50 and 0.52 for the Tibetan Plateau. VNP shows slightly better accuracy than MODIS TERRA for stations outside the Tibetan Plateau owing to its higher spatial resolution, but its accuracy is lower than TERRA for those within the Tibetan Plateau possibly due to its longer time interval between ground observation and satellite overpass time. By contrast, VNP shows much better accuracy than MODIS AQUA in China including both outside and within the Tibetan Plateau. This study provides important implications for optimal use of VNP and MODIS daily snow cover products in China, which may further contribute to more accurate snow variation information for climate analysis and cryospheric hydrological modelling.<bold> </bold>

TI  - Long time-series remote sensing analysis of the periodic cycle evolution of the inlets and ebb-tidal delta of Xincun Lagoon, Hainan Island, China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal lagoon-tidal inlet systems occur worldwide, and each has its own unique evolution characteristics in relation to its geographical location, sediment characteristics, and tidal current and ocean wave conditions. However, insufficient observation data means that it is often difficult to fully understand the long-term and short-term evolution of ebb-tidal deltas, and it is even more difficult to monitor and warn against their evolution. This study uses long time-series remote sensing data for the period 1962-2018 to investigate the evolution of an ebb-tidal delta in Xincun Lagoon, Hainan Island, China. Four shoal-sandbar breaching and tidal-inlet migration events were observed, and the corresponding periodic variation characteristics of the ebb-tidal delta were documented. A conceptual model for the periodic evolution of ebb-tidal deltas was also proposed. The results showed that the long-period (15-20 years) evolution was controlled by the effects of seabed friction and tidal-scale lagoon resonance, while the changes in the length of the east sand-spit could be used as a significant early warning indicator for shoal-sandbar breaching and tidal-inlet migration events. In addition, both types of event were jointly triggered by typhoon storm-surges and the accompanying heavy rainfall, strong winds, and strong waves. Thus, the periodic evolution process of the ebb-tidal delta in Xincun Lagoon was determined to be a systematic process that is either controlled or influenced by a series of interconnecting factors. Moreover, we concluded that it is both feasible and valuable to establish a monitoring and early warning framework of ebbtidal deltas through the use of time-series remote sensing images. The results of this study can improve the existing understanding of the processes and driving factors of periodic shoal-sandbar breaching and tidal-inlet migration, and can also increase safety nourishment for coastal lagoon-tidal inlet systems.

T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN RHEUMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewThe field of osteoporosis research has been active for the past 20 years and has allowed significant advancement in the management of osteoporosis. This review will give an overview of the latest data from international cohorts that relate to current and recent osteoporosis research.Recent findingsThe clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis relies heavily on bone mineral density (BMD) measured at femoral neck or spine and although BMD has excellent predictive value for future fractures, fracture risk assessment has evolved over the years, resulting in the birth of fracture prediction tools. Fracture risk factors not currently featured in these tools are being considered for inclusion, including imminent risk fracture following a sentinel fracture, number of falls, and previous vertebral fractures. Data from groups with comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are helping us understand how to best manage patients with multiple comorbidities. Finally, the prevalence of vertebral fracture in the older general population and other selected populations has been explored, alongside the global burden of osteoporosis and its consequences.SummaryOur understanding of osteoporosis continues to expand, but knowledge gaps remain.

TI  - Construction of a plant spectral library based on an optimised feature selection method
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing data have great potential for plant classification, monitoring, and mapping due to their considerable spectral information. A spectral library can be used for the automatic interpretation of remote sensing data, which is an efficient tool for the classification of plant species. Given that similar spectral signatures are usually found among different plant species, it is critical to identify plant-sensitive spectral features when constructing a robust plant spectral library. This study proposed an approach to the establishment and application of a plant spectral library based on spectral data from ground objects. It included a spectral feature screening method for plant spectral response and a feature robustness analysis method suitable for monitoring, while unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral imaging data was used to validate mapping results. This study was divided into an urban scenario and an agricultural scenario based on plant composition, and a set of spectral feature sensitivity methods based on Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis (ISODATA) and Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance was proposed. At the same time, a robust spectral analysis method was developed based on illumination and noise disturbance. The performance of K-nearest neighbour algorithm (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine coupled with a Genetic Algorithm (GA-SVM) for plant classification modelling were compared. Results showed that the spectral indices obtained by sensitivity and robustness screening were effective for plant classification, and the GA-SVM model had the highest accuracy with overall accuracy (OAA) = 0.98, Kappa = 0.98 in the urban scenario, and OAA = 0.97, Kappa = 0.97 in the agricultural scenario. In addition, pixel-based crop classification validation based on UAV hyperspectral imaging also had high accuracy, and the plot level classification results were in good agreement with field survey results. Therefore, it is feasible to use a plant spectral library to assist in monitoring and mapping of plant species using hyperspectral remote sensing images at large scales. The effects of plant growth status, growth stage, and other changes on classification should be further studied. (C) 2020 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Use of Sentinel-1 GRD SAR Images to Delineate Flood Extent in Pakistan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are some of the most serious and devastating natural hazards on earth, bringing huge threats to lives, properties, and living environments. Rapid delineation of the spatial extent of flooding is of great importance for the dynamic monitoring of flood evolution and corresponding emergency strategies. Some of the current flood mapping methods mainly process single date images characterized by simple flood situations and homogenous backgrounds. Although other methods show good performance for images with harsh conditions for floods, they must be trained-many times based on pre-classified samples-or undergo complicated parameter tuning processes, which require computation efforts. The widely used change detection methods utilize multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images for the detection of flood area, but the results are largely influenced by the quality of defined reference images. Furthermore, these methods were mostly applied for some river basin floods, which are not effective for the large scale, semi-arid regions with complex flood conditions, and various land cover types. All of these extremely limited the use of these methods for the timely and accurate extraction of the spatial distribution pattern of floods in other typical and broad areas. Based on the above considerations, this paper presents a new method for rapidly determining the extent of flooding in large, semi-arid areas with challenging environmental conditions, based on multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. First, a preprocessing scheme is applied to perform geometric correction and to estimate the intensity of the imagery. Second, an automatic thresholding procedure is used to generate an initial land and water classification through the integration of the probability density distribution. A fuzzy logic-based approach, combining SAR backscattering information and other auxiliary data, is then used to refine the initial classified image. The fuzzy logic-based refinement removes areas that look similar to water in the SAR images, significantly enhancing the flood mapping accuracy. Finally, a post-processing step consisting of morphological operations and extraction improves the homogeneity of the extracted flood segments, discards isolated pixels, and gives the final flood map. This method can automatically detect the extent of floods at little computational cost. As Sentinel-1 data are publicly available and have a fast repeat cycle, the procedure can provide near real time results for rapid emergency response following flash floods. The accuracy of the proposed method is assessed at three test sites in Pakistan, which covered diverse landscapes and suffered large scale serious flooding after a long and severe drought in 2015. In comparison with the more recent studies from Ohki et al., 2020, and Shahabi et al., 2020, our results indicate the best spatial agreement with GF-2 panchromatic multi-spectral (PMS) water classification, with an encouraging overall accuracy ranging from 91.1% to 96.6%, and Kappa coefficients ranging from 0.893 to 0.954. Especially for the areas with fragmented floods, heterogeneous backgrounds, and the areas where samples are highly unbalanced in the SAR images, our method combines the global statistics and local relationships of backscattering properties, terrain, and other auxiliary information, enabling to effectively preserve the detailed structures and also remove the noise.

TI  - An Investigation of Vertically Distributed Aerosol Optical Properties over Pakistan Using CALIPSO Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertically distributed aerosol optical properties are investigated over Pakistan utilizing the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Level 2 products from 2007 to 2014. For a better understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics of vertical aerosol layers, the interannual and seasonal variations of nine selected aerosol parameters such as the AOD of the lowest aerosol layer (AOD(L)), the base height of the lowest aerosol layer (H-L), the top height of the highest aerosol layer (H-H), the volume depolarization ratio of the lowest aerosol layer (DRL), the color ratio of the lowest aerosol layer (CRL), total AOD of all the aerosol layers (AOD(T)), the number of aerosol feature layers (N), the thickness of the lowest aerosol layer (T-L), the AOD proportion for the lowest aerosol layer (PAOD(L)) for both day and night times are analyzed. The results show AOD(T)increased slightly from 2007 to 2014 over Pakistan, and relatively high AOD(T)exists over the Punjab and Sindh (southern region), which might be owing to the high level of economic development, frequent dust storms, and profound agricultural activities (anthropogenic emissions). AOD(T)increases from north to south. The reason may be that the southern region is rapidly urbanized and is near the desert. The northern region is dominated by agricultural land, and cities are usually semi-urbanized. The highest AOD(T)appears in summer compared to the other seasons, and during daytime compared to nighttime. The H(L)and H(H)vary significantly, owing to the topography of Pakistan. The N is relatively large over Punjab and Sindh compared to the other regions, which might be caused by relatively stronger atmospheric convections. The spatial distribution of the T(L)showed an inverse relationship with the topography as lower values are observed over elevated regions such as Gilgit-Baltistan and Jammu-Kashmir. The value of the PAOD(L)indicates that 77% of the total aerosols are mainly concentrated in the lowest layer of the atmosphere over Pakistan. The higher values of DR(L)and CR(L)indicate non-spherical and large particles over Balochistan and Sindh, which might be related to the proximity to the desert. This study provides very useful information about vertically distributed aerosol optical properties which could help researchers and policymakers to regulate and mitigate air pollution issues of Pakistan.

TI  - Development of the Chinese Space-Based Radiometric Benchmark Mission LIBRA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate observations and their applications require measurements with high stability and low uncertainty in order to detect and assess climate variability and trends. The difficulty with space-based observations is that it is generally not possible to trace them to standard calibration references when in orbit. In order to overcome this problem, it has been proposed to deploy space-based radiometric reference systems which intercalibrate measurements from multiple satellite platforms. Such reference systems have been strongly recommended by international expert teams. This paper describes the Chinese Space-based Radiometric Benchmark (CSRB) project which has been under development since 2014. The goal of CSRB is to launch a reference-type satellite named LIBRA in around 2025. We present the roadmap for CSRB as well as requirements and specifications for LIBRA. Key technologies of the system include miniature phase-change cells providing fixed-temperature points, a cryogenic absolute radiometer, and a spontaneous parametric down-conversion detector. LIBRA will offer measurements with SI traceability for the outgoing radiation from the Earth and the incoming radiation from the Sun with high spectral resolution. The system will be realized with four payloads, i.e., the Infrared Spectrometer (IRS), the Earth-Moon Imaging Spectrometer (EMIS), the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI), and the Solar spectral Irradiance Traceable to Quantum benchmark (SITQ). An on-orbit mode for radiometric calibration traceability and a balloon-based demonstration system for LIBRA are introduced as well in the last part of this paper. As a complementary project to the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) and the Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial- and Helio- Studies (TRUTHS), LIBRA is expected to join the Earth observation satellite constellation and intends to contribute to space-based climate studies via publicly available data.

TI  - The spatial granularity effect, changing landscape patterns, and suitable landscape metrics in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, 1995-2015
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three Gorges Project (TGP) is a mega-water conservancy and hydropower project that have attracted worldwide attention. Under the influence of human activities, the landscape pattern has changed greatly. Using landscape metrics to analyze landscape pattern changes is the critical to understanding landscape pattern and ecological process. In this study, Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images are used to extract indices for area edge, shape, spatial distribution, and diversity. Additionally, 19 landscape indices are taken to scale the granularity of the landscape level and the class level. An analysis of appropriate size is used to quantify the response of landscape indices to change landscape patterns during the four stages and a Crosstab model is used for pattern presentation. Finally, landscape indices are analyzed utilizing of Pearson correlation method to identify the landscape indicators suitable for the Three Gorges Reservoir. We have found that both the class level and landscape level indices are sensitive to grain size changes. Our results suggest that the suitable grain size is 30-60 m. Furthermore, the indicators suitable applied to analyzing changes in the landscape patterns in the TGR are Class Area (CA), Number of Patch (NP), Largest Patch Index (LPI), Landscape Shape Index (LSI), Effective Mesh Size (MESH), and Patch Density (PD). The main reasons for the change of landscape pattern in the Three Gorges Reservoir are land consolidation project, returning farmland to forest project, nature reserve construction, hydropower station construction and urbanization development.

TI  - Automated Extraction of Visible Floodwater in Dense Urban Areas from RGB Aerial Photos
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid response mapping of floodwater extents in urbanized areas, while essential for early damage assessment and rescue operations, also presents significant image interpretation challenges. Images from visible band (red-green-blue (RGB)) remote sensors are the most common and cost-effective for real-time applications. Based on an understanding of the differing characteristics of turbid floodwater and urban land surface classes, a robust method was developed and automatized to extract visible floodwater using RGB band digital numbers. The methodology was applied to delineate visible floodwater distribution from very high-resolution aerial image data acquired during the 2013 Calgary flood event. The methodology development involved segment- and pixel-based feature analysis, rule development, automated feature extraction, and result validation processing. The accuracies for the visible floodwater class were above 0.8394% and the overall accuracies were above 0.9668% at both pixel and segment levels for three test sites with diverse urban landscapes.

TI  - Retrieval of Soil Moisture Content Based on a Modified Hapke Photometric Model: A Novel Method Applied to Laboratory Hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 MSI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is the crucial carrier of the global hydrologic cycle and the dynamic energy balance regulation process. Therefore, it is of great significance to monitor surface soil moisture content (SMC) accurately for the study of the natural ecological environment. The Hapke model is the most widely used photometric model in soil remote sensing research, but the development of this model is limited by the lack of valid multi-angular data. The main innovations of this paper have two aspects: (1) A novel soil moisture retrieval approach based on the Hapke (SMR-Hapke) model is derived by exploring the relationship between single scattering albedo (SSA) and SMC on the optical bands from 400 to 2400 nm. The performance of the proposed model was verified on a dataset consisting of four different soil samples, and the experimental results indicated that the inverted soil moisture from SMR-Hapke model coincided with the measurement values, with theR(2)being generally more than 0.9 in the solar domain. (2) The SMR-Hapke model has been reduced to a linear form on the SWIR field and a physically-based normalized difference soil moisture indexNDSMIHapke has been proposed. Based on the laboratory-based hyperspectral data, we compared the performance ofNDSMIHapke with other traditional soil moisture indices using linear regression analysis, and the results demonstrate that the proposedNDSMIHapke had a great potential for estimating SMC withR(2)values of 0.88. Finally, high-resolution SMC map was produced by combining the Sentinel-2 MSI data withNDSMIHapke. This study provides a novel extended Hapke model for the estimation of surface soil moisture content.

TI  - Preliminary Study of Land-Sea Microphysics Associated with the East Asian Summer Monsoon Rainband and Its Application to GPM DPR
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Raindrop size distribution (DSD) characteristics during the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) were studied, using measurements from three OTT Particle Size Velocity (Parsivel) disdrometers in Nanjing, Chuzhou, and the northwestern Pacific (NWP), respectively. Western and eastern parts of the monsoon rainband were separated for a comparative study of the DSD variability. Along with disdrometer data, GPM Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR), Fengyun-2E (FY-2E), MODIS, GPCP, ERA-Interim, and in situ radiosonde datasets are combined to illustrate the possible microphysical mechanisms for the significant DSD variability in two parts, in terms of convective intensity, cloud structure, and aerosol effects. The DSD characteristics of six rain-rate classes and two rainfall categories (convective and stratiform) were studied. The western part has larger mass-weighted mean diameter D-m while smaller normalized intercept log(10)(N-w) than the eastern part, and the convective clusters of the western part (land) could be identified more maritime-like than continental-like due to moisture transport from the tropical ocean, while that of the eastern part (sea) is between maritime-like and continental-like. Cross validation of GPM rainfall products are implemented based on surface disdrometer observations. DPR products manifest better performance over sea than land areas of the EASM rainband. Empirical D-m-Z(e) and N-w-D-m relations were also derived preliminarily to improve the GPM rain-retrieval algorithms in the EASM season.

TI  - Application of Hyperspectral Imaging for Assessment of Tomato Leaf Water Status in Plant Factories
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation management continues to be an important issue for tomato cultivation, especially in plant factories. Accurate and timely assessment of tomato leaf water status is a key factor in enabling appropriate irrigation, which can save nutrition solution and labor. In recent decades, hyperspectral imaging has been widely used as a nondestructive measurement method in agriculture to obtain plant biological information. The objective of this research was to establish an approach to obtain the tomato leaf water status-specifically, the relative water content (WC) and equivalent water thickness (MC)-for five different tomato cultivars in real time by using hyperspectral imaging. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and two-band vegetation index (TBI) analyses were performed on the tomato leaf raw relative reflection (RAW), the inversion-logarithm relative reflection (LOG), and the first derivative of relative reflection (DIFF) from wavelengths of 900 nm to 1700 nm. The best regression model for WC assessment was obtained by TBI regression using DIFF at wavelengths of 1410 nm and 1520 nm, and the best regression model for MC assessment was obtained by NDVI regression using RAW at wavelengths of 1300 nm and 1310 nm. Higher model performance was obtained with MC assessment than with WC assessment. The results will help improve our understanding of the relationship between hyperspectral reflectance and leaf water status.

TI  - Purely satellite data-driven deep learning forecast of complicated tropical instability waves
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting fields of oceanic phenomena has long been dependent on physical equation-based numerical models. The challenge is that many natural processes need to be considered for understanding complicated phenomena. In contrast, rules of the processes are already embedded in the time-series observation itself. Thus, inspired by largely available satellite remote sensing data and the advance of deep learning technology, we developed a purely satellite data-driven deep learning model for forecasting the sea surface temperature evolution associated with a typical phenomenon: a tropical instability wave. During the testing period of 9 years (2010-2019), our model accurately and efficiently forecasts the sea surface temperature field. This study demonstrates the strong potential of the satellite data-driven deep learning model as an alternative to traditional numerical models for forecasting oceanic phenomena.

TI  - Deep Convolutional Neural Network-Based Robust Phase Gradient Estimation for Two-Dimensional Phase Unwrapping Using SAR Interferograms
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two-dimensional phase unwrapping (2-D PU) is one of the key processes in reconstructing the topography or displacement of the Earth surface from its interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. Estimating the absolute phase gradient information is an unavoidable step utilized by almost all the 2-D PU methods. Traditionally, the gradient estimation step relies on the phase continuity assumption, which requests that the observed area has spatial continuity. However, the abrupt topographic changes and system noise usually results in the failure of the phase continuity assumption in reality. Under this condition, it is difficult for the traditional 2-D PU to provide the correct absolute phase over the area with abrupt interferometric fringe change or with strong system noise. To solve the issue, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), abbreviated as PGNet, to estimate the phase gradient information instead of the phase continuity assumption in this article. The major advantage of PGNet lies in its deep architecture to learn the characteristics of phase gradients from enormous training images with different noise levels and topographic features. Subsequently, the L-1-norm objective function is used to minimize the difference between unwrapped phase gradients and the gradients estimated by PGNet for obtaining the final PU result. Taking the phase gradient pattern of the TerraSAR-X-TanDEM-X interferogram as the learning object, experimental results demonstrate the absolute phase gradient estimated by PGNet is more credible than that from the phase continuity assumption such that the corresponding PU result outperforms those obtained by the traditional 2-D PU methods.

TI  - Application of Image Segmentation in Surface Water Extraction of Freshwater Lakes using Radar Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater lakes supply a large amount of inland water resources to sustain local and regional developments. However, some lake systems depend upon great fluctuation in water surface area. Poyang lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, undergoes dramatic seasonal and interannual variations. Timely monitoring of Poyang lake surface provides essential information on variation of water occurrence for its ecosystem conservation. Application of histogram-based image segmentation in radar imagery has been widely used to detect water surface of lakes. Still, it is challenging to select the optimal threshold. Here, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of a segmentation algorithm, the Otsu Method, from both mathematical and application perspectives. We implement the Otsu Method and provide reusable scripts to automatically select a threshold for surface water extraction using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery on Google Earth Engine, a cloud-based platform that accelerates processing of Sentinel-1 data and auto-threshold computation. The optimal thresholds for each January from 2017 to 2020 are-14.88,-16.93,-16.96and-16.87respectively, and the overall accuracy achieves92%after rectification. Furthermore, our study contributes to the update of temporal and spatial variation of Poyang lake, confirming that its surface water area fluctuated annually and tended to shrink both in the center and boundary of the lake on each January from 2017 to 2020.

TI  - Mapping soil organic carbon content using multi-source remote sensing variables in the Heihe River Basin in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) has a large impact on soil quality and global climate change. It is therefore important to be able to predict SOC accurately to promote sustainable soil management. Although the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has many advantages and has been widely used in soil science research, it has rarely been used in previous SOC mapping studies based on remote sensing images. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A data in SOC prediction, by comparing the predictive performance of random forest (RF) and boosted regression tree (BRT) models in the Heihe River Basin in northwestern China. A set of 162 topsoil (0-20 cm) samples were taken and 15 environmental variables were obtained including land use, topography, climate, and remote sensing images (optical and SAR data). Using a cross-validation procedure to evaluate the performance of the models, three statistical indices were calculated. Overall, both RF and BRT models effectively predicted SOC content, exhibiting similar performance and producing similar spatial distribution patterns of SOC. The results showed that the addition of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A images improved prediction accuracy, with the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) improving by 9.0%, 8.3% and 13.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of all environmental variables had the best prediction performance explaining 75% of SOC variation. The most important environmental variables explaining SOC variation were precipitation, elevation, and temperature. The multi-temporal Sentinel-1A data in RF and BRT models explained 9% and 7%, respectively. The results from our case study highlight the usefulness of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data in SOC mapping.

TI  - Mapping forest height using photon-counting LiDAR data and Landsat 8 OLI data: A case study in Virginia and North Carolina, USA
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale, accurate and detailed forest height map is worthwhile and necessary for understanding and assessing global carbon cycle and biodiversity. The Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission, employing a photon-counting LiDAR (PCL) system, offers an opportunity to map global forest height with high resolution. This study aimed to map forest height at a spatial resolution of 30 m by combining Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL) data with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. There are four key steps to accomplish this goal. First, a segmentation method based on the Douglas-Peucker algorithm was proposed to solve the problem of large turns or calibration maneuvers in MABEL data. Second, we estimated forest height and selected the forest height samples with high accuracy and reliability by developing three filters including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) filter, slope filter, and canopy photons density (CPD) filter. Third, forest height models based on both random forest (RF) and stepwise multiple regression algorithms were developed to establish relationships between the selected forest height samples and predicator variables of Landsat-derived spectral indices, topographic variables and geographic coordinates. Finally, a wall-to-wall forest height map was generated by applying the developed forest height models to predicator variables, and the accuracy of forest height map was validated using airborne LiDAR-derived forest heights. An area of 160, 000 km(2) in southeast Virginia and east North Carolina was chosen for testing the methods proposed in this study. The results demonstrated that the Douglas-Peucker algorithm can effectively solve the MABEL data overlapping issues caused by large turns and calibration maneuvers in flight lines. The suitable filters for selecting forest heights are SNR > 6, terrain slope < 25 degrees, and 40 < CPD < 170. These developed filters can substantially increase the accuracies of forest height models. The results also indicated that RF-derived forest height models achieved higher modeling accuracy than stepwise regression-derived forest height models. RF-derived forest height models yielded coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.59, 0.68 and 0.62 and RMSE values of 4.55 m, 3.41 m and 4.08 m for deciduous forest, evergreen forest and mixed forest, respectively. Compared to LiDAR-derived forest height, the forest height map produced in this study has a R-2 value of 0.54 and a RMSE value of 6.85 m, which demonstrates that combination of MABEL data and Landsat 8 OLI data can be used to generate forest height maps with a spatial resolution of 30 m.

TI  - Dynamics of woody plant cover in the Sahelian agroecosystems of the northern region of Burkina Faso since the 1970s-1980s droughts
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out in the northern region of Burkina Faso under Sahelian climatic conditions. The area was particularly affected by the 1970s-1980s droughts that led to the degradation of land and vegetation. Since the early 1990s, a gradual return of rainfall has been observed throughout the Sahel region. In this new environmental context, understanding the development of woody plants is important for effective conservation and management. We analyzed the dynamics of woody plant cover over the 30 years following the end of the 1970s-1980s droughts by using Landsat images from 1986, 1999, and 2015 with 30 m spatial resolution and taking into account changes in rainfall and land use. The change in the enhanced vegetation index 1 (EVI1) at the beginning of the dry season was used as a proxy for the change in photosynthetic activity of woody plants. Results showed an improvement in EVI1 on 98% of the study area, with a mean increase of 0.20 from 1986 to 2015. This improvement was accompanied by an increase in agroforestry and was weakly correlated with rainfall. The improvement in EVI1 was unstable, however, with a decline from 1999 to 2015 in the areas undergoing regreening.

TI  - Local climatically-driven changes of albedo and surface temperatures in the Sonoran Desert
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors explore a new approach to monitoring patches of ground with accentuated desert conditions, here called "parcels of desertification", resulting from the relation between albedo and surface temperature values. The territory of the El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve in northwestern Sonora, Mexico serves as the example to substantiate the procedure. The region is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a feature that guarantees minimum anthropogenic impact in the reserve. The results indicate that the approach was successful in identifying only one parcel of desertification in the study area. The parcel appears annually, though it varies in extent and intensity, when NDVI falls below the values 0.09-0.10 in the spring dry periods (April-June) of 2000-2017. This occurs when the radiation mechanism of surface temperature regulation begins to dominate in relation to the evapotranspiration mechanism. Its localization is practically constant year after year, indicating that it is climatically conditioned, i.e., is not caused by anthropogenic pressure. The intensity of desertification in the parcel has a significant upward trend. Two types of a seasonal course of intensity are established, depending on the change of the SOI sign in the spring.

TI  - Assessing the Temporal Response of Tropical Dry Forests to Meteorological Drought
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to excessive human disturbances, as well as predicted changes in precipitation regimes, tropical dry forests (TDFs) are susceptible to meteorological droughts. Here, we explored the response of TDFs to meteorological drought by conducting temporal correlations between the MODIS-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) to a standardized precipitation index (SPI) between March 2000 and March 2017 at the Santa Rosa National Park Environmental Monitoring Super Site (SRNP-EMSS), Guanacaste, Costa Rica. We conducted this study using monthly and seasonal scales. Our results indicate that the NDVI and LST are largely influenced by seasonality, as well as the magnitude, duration, and timing of precipitation. We find that greenness and evapotranspiration are highly sensitive to precipitation when TDFs suffer from long-term water deficiency, and they tend to be slightly resistant to meteorological drought in the wet season. Greenness is more resistant to short-term rainfall deficiency than evapotranspiration, but greenness is more sensitive to precipitation after a period of rainfall deficiency. Precipitation can still strongly influence evapotranspiration on the canopy surface, but greenness is not controlled by the rainfall, but rather phenological characteristics when leaves begin to senesce.

TI  - Using Landsat Data to Detect Change in Live to Recently (&lt;6 Months) Dead Coral Cover in the Western Xisha Islands, South China Sea
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount of live and dead coral is related to recruitment, but differentiating them by remote sensing techniques is difficult. We measured change in the amount of live, bleached, and recently (<6 months) dead coral cover (CCA6) for an island archipelago in the South China Sea. Six Landsat 4/7 ETM/8 OLI images from 1989-1990, 2005, and 2014 were analyzed to assess changes in CCA6 at 14 coral reefs in the western Xisha Islands. Satellite images were georectified and calibrated to remote sensing reflectance. Models for three shallow water (<6 m) geomorphic zones throughout the western Xisha Islands are proposed based on ground-truthed data collected in 2014 and satellite-determined spectral values for 2014 images. Nonlinear models based on Landsat image blue spectral bands for reef slope and lagoon habitats, and green bands for reef flat habitats, are determined as optimal models. Significant changes in CCA6 from 2005 to 2014, and changes in coral reefs and geomorphic zones, correlate with increased numbers of both crown-of-thorns starfish, and sea surface temperature in 2007. Detecting change in CCA6 by remote sensing can provide large-scale information of value for coral reef management, restoration, and protection.

TI  - Direct Dielectric Barrier Discharge Ionization Promotes Rapid and Simple Lubricant Oil Fingerprinting
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MASS SPECTROMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Petroleomics, which is the characterization, separation, and quantification of the components of petroleum and crude oil, is an emerging area of study. However, the repertoire of analytical methods available to understand commercial automotive lubricant oils (ALOs) is very limited. Ambient mass spectrometry is one of the most sensitive analytical methods for real-time and in situ chemical analysis. With this technique, the chemical fingerprinting of ALOs can be performed quickly and simply using dielectric barrier discharge ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In this study, the mass spectra of 35 samples were obtained without any sample preparation in positive-ion mode, and no carryover was observed. To elucidate the similarities and differences between the ALO samples, the data generated from these spectra were analyzed using four chemometric techniques: principal component analysis, multivariate curve resolution, hierarchical cluster analysis, and pattern recognition entropy. The ALO samples were readily differentiated according to their American Petroleum Institute classification and base oil types: mineral, semisynthetic, and synthetic. The development of this new methodology will aid in the semiquantitative control analysis of ALOs and offers an improved ability to identify the components therein.

TI  - The effects of land use land cover change on hydrological flow in Giba catchment, Tigray, Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tigray regional government has proposed land use land cover (LULC) change due to the 5-year growth and transformation plan (GTP). This LULC change could have an effect on hydrological flow. Hence, quantifying the hydrological flow coming due to the LULC change is important for decision making. Considering this, we set out to assess the impact of LULC change on hydrological flow of Gibe catchment using three LULC scenarios as compared to the base year (2010). The three scenarios were, increasing forest area, plantations/area closure and grass lands by 400, 200, and 200% from the base year, respectively. SWAT model was used to simulate the hydrological flow. The model was run on a daily time series for 7 years: calibrated during the 5 years (1998-2002), and validated during the 2 years (2003-2004). The simulated daily flow showed a good agreement to the observed flow with NSE = 0.81, R-2 = 0.78 and PBIAS = -6.85 % for calibration, and NSE = 0.79, R-2 = 0.75 and PBIAS = -7.52 for validation. The simulation result of the hydrological flow under the scenarios showed that increasing forest, plantation/area closure, and grass land have reduced the annual flow by 8.61, 4.65, and 1.45%, respectively. Reducing the hydrological flow could increase ground water potential and dry season base flow, which can be used for irrigation. Therefore, it is recommended that the government should strengthen the policy on natural resources management.

TI  - Plastic Ingestion in Sardines (<i>Sardinops sagax</i>) From Frenchman Bay, Western Australia, Highlights a Problem in a Ubiquitous Fish
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ingestion of plastic debris has been studied in many marine fish species, although comparisons between species can be difficult due to factors thought to influence ingestion rates, such as habitat preference, feeding behaviours and trophic level. Sardines are found internationally in many coastal environments and represent a potential sentinel species for monitoring and comparing marine plastic exposure rates. We conducted a pilot study, examining the rate of plastic ingestion in 27 commercially caught sardines (Sardinops sagax) from a low populated coastal region of Western Australia. A total of 251 potentially anthropogenic particles were extracted by chemical digestion of the gastrointestinal tract and classified visually. Fibres were the dominant type of material recovered (82.9%), with both yellow (39.8%) and black (32.7%) coloured particles commonly observed. A subset of 64 particles (25.5%), were subject to Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to identify polymer composition. This chemical characterisation identified seven plastic items (polypropylene, nylon and polyethylene) and a variety of cellulose-based material that was further examined and classified as natural or semi-synthetic. The mean plastic ingestion rate was 0.3 +/- 0.4 particles per fish, suggesting Western Australian sardines ingest relatively low concentrations of plastic when compared to international sardine populations examined using similar methodologies. Despite comparatively low concentrations, plastic and semi-synthetic material are still being ingested by sardines from a low populated coastal region demonstrating the ubiquitous nature of the marine debris problem.

TI  - The 3′ processing of antisense RNAs physically links to chromatin-based transcriptional control
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Noncoding RNA plays essential roles in transcriptional control and chromatin silencing. At Arabidopsis thaliana FLC, antisense transcription quantitatively influences transcriptional output, but the mechanism by which this occurs is still unclear. Proximal polyadenylation of the antisense transcripts by FCA, an RNA-binding protein that physically interacts with RNA 3' processing factors, reduces FLC transcription. This process genetically requires FLD, a homolog of the H3K4 demethylase LSD1. However, the mechanism linking RNA processing to FLD function had not been established. Here, we show that FLD tightly associates with LUMINIDEPENDENS (LD) and SET DOMAIN GROUP 26 (SDG26) in vivo, and, together, they prevent accumulation of monomethylated H3K4 (H3K4me1) over the FLC gene body. SDG26 interacts with the RNA 3' processing factor FY (WDR33), thus linking activities for proximal polyadenylation of the antisense transcripts to FLD/LD/SDG26-associated H3K4 demethylation. We propose this demethylation antagonizes an active transcription module, thus reducing H3K36me3 accumulation and increasing H3K27me3. Consistent with this view, we show that Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) silencing is genetically required by FCA to repress FLC. Overall, our work provides insights into RNA-mediated chromatin silencing.

TI  - Inter-annual variability in snow cover depletion patterns and atmospheric circulation indices in the Upper Irtysh basin, Central Asia
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Irtysh River is the main water resource of Eastern Kazakhstan and its upper basin is severely affected by spring floods each year, primarily as a result of snowmelt. Knowledge of the large-scale processes that influence the timing of these snow-induced floods is currently lacking, but critical for the management of water resources in the area. In this study, we evaluated the variability in winter-spring snow cover in five major sub-basins of the Upper Irtysh basin between 2000 and 2017 as a possible explanatory factor of spring flood events, assessing the time of peak snow cover depletion rate and snow cover disappearance from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD10A2 data set. We found that on average, peak snow cover retreat occurs between 22 March and 14 April depending on the basin, with large interannual variations but no clear trend over the MODIS period, while our comparative analysis of longer-term snow cover extent from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Data Record data set suggests a shift to earlier snow cover disappearance since the 1970s. In contrast, the annual peak snow cover depletion rate displays a weak increasing trend over the study period and exceeded 5,900 km(2)/day in 2017. The timing of snow disappearance in spring shows significant correlations of up to 0.82 for the largest basin with winter indices of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) over the region. The primary driver is the impact of the large-scale pressure anomalies upon the mean spring (MAM) air temperatures and resultant timing of snow cover disappearance, particularly at elevations 500-2,000 m above sea level. This suggests a lagged effect of this atmospheric circulation pattern in spring snow cover retreat. The winter AO index could therefore be incorporated into long-term runoff forecasts for the Irtysh. Our approach is easily transferable to other similar catchments and could support flood management strategies in Kazakhstan and other countries.

TI  - Call Centre Karma, or How Popular Culture Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Outsourcing
T2  - CRITICAL ARTS-SOUTH-NORTH CULTURAL AND MEDIA STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2006, numerous movies and TV series have depicted outsourcing to India as a source of both economic and personal opportunity for American, Canadian, British and Indian characters. There has been no sustained assessment, however, of individual screen texts which address call centre work, nor any comparative work that might shed light on the significance of this transnational phenomenon. Using discourse and visual analysis, films including Outsourced, The Other End of the Line, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and TV series such as Outsourced and Mumbai Calling are shown to address popular fears over outsourcing by positing a shared neoliberal worldview, one that traverses national boundaries and histories, drawing both on enduring orientalist stereotypes and narrative tropes, as well as recent trends in Bollywood and American popular culture. These screen texts contain a limited critique of late capitalism, but nonetheless reimagine the purported risks of globalization as founts for potential benefit, both material and social, and often reconfirm the essential superiority of the West and Westerners.

TI  - High-resolution urban land-cover mapping and landscape analysis of the 42 major cities in China using ZY-3 satellite images
T2  - SCIENCE BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed and precise urban land-cover maps are crucial for urban-related studies. However, there are limited ways of mapping high-resolution urban land cover over large areas. In this paper, we propose an operational framework to map urban land cover on the basis of Ziyuan-3 satellite images. Based on this framework, we produced the first high-resolution (2 m) urban land-cover map (Hi-ULCM) covering the 42 major cities of China. The overall accuracy of the Hi-ULCM dataset is 88.55%, of which 14 cities have an overall accuracy of over 90%. Most of the producer's accuracies and user's accuracies of the land-cover classes exceed 85%. We further conducted a landscape pattern analysis in the 42 cities based on Hi-ULCM. In terms of the comparison between the 42 cities in China, we found that the difference in the land-cover composition of urban areas is related to the climatic characteristics and urbanization levels, e.g., cities with warm climates generally have higher proportions of green spaces. It is also interesting to find that cities with higher urbanization levels are more habitable, in general. From the landscape viewpoint, the geometric complexity of the landscape increases with the urbanization level. Compared with the existing medium-resolution land-cover/use datasets (at a 30-m resolution), Hi-ULCM represents a significant advance in accurately depicting the detailed land-cover footprint within the urban areas of China, and will be of great use for studies of urban ecosystems.

TI  - Using altimetry observations combined with GRACE to select parameter sets of a hydrological model in a data-scarce region
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited availability of ground measurements in the vast majority of river basins world-wide increases the value of alternative data sources such as satellite observations in hydrological modelling. This study investigates the potential of using remotely sensed river water levels, i.e. altimetry observations, from multiple satellite missions to identify parameter sets for a hydrological model in the semi-arid Luangwa River basin in Zambia. A distributed process-based rainfall-runoff model with sub-grid process heterogeneity was developed and run on a daily timescale for the time period 2002 to 2016. As a benchmark, feasible model parameter sets were identified using traditional model calibration with observed river discharge data. For the parameter identification using remote sensing, data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) were used in a first step to restrict the feasible parameter sets based on the seasonal fluctuations in total water storage. Next, three alternative ways of further restricting feasible model parameter sets using satellite altimetry time series from 18 different locations along the river were compared. In the calibrated benchmark case, daily river flows were reproduced relatively well with an optimum Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of E-NS,E-Q = 0.78 (5/95th percentiles of all feasible solutions E-NS,E-Q,E-5/95 = 0.61-0.75). When using only GRACE observations to restrict the parameter space, assuming no discharge observations are available, an optimum of E-NS,E-Q = 1.4 (E-NS,E-Q,E-5/95 = 2.3-0.38) with respect to discharge was obtained. The direct use of altimetry-based river levels frequently led to overestimated flows and poorly identified feasible parameter sets (E-NS,E-Q,E-5/95 = 2.9-0.10). Similarly, converting modelled discharge into water levels using rating curves in the form of power relationships with two additional free calibration parameters per virtual station resulted in an overestimation of the discharge and poorly identified feasible parameter sets (E-NS,E-Q,E-5/95 = 2.6-0.25). However, accounting for river geometry proved to be highly effective. This included using river cross-section and gradient information extracted from global high-resolution terrain data available on Google Earth and applying the Strickler-Manning equation to convert modelled discharge into water levels. Many parameter sets identified with this method reproduced the hydrograph and multiple other signatures of discharge reasonably well, with an optimum of E-NS,E-Q = 0.60 (E-NS,E-Q,E-5/95 = 0.31-0.50). It was further shown that more accurate river cross-section data improved the water-level simulations, modelled rating curve, and discharge simulations during intermediate and low flows at the basin outlet where detailed on-site cross-section information was available. Also, increasing the number of virtual stations used for parameter selection in the calibration period considerably improved the model performance in a spatial split-sample validation. The results provide robust evidence that in the absence of directly observed discharge data for larger rivers in data-scarce regions, altimetry data from multiple virtual stations combined with GRACE observations have the potential to fill this gap when combined with readily available estimates of river geometry, thereby allowing a step towards more reliable hydrological modelling in poorly gauged or un-gauged basins.

TI  - Mapping shoreline change using machine learning: a case study from the eastern Indian coast
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous shift of shoreline boundaries due to natural or anthropogenic events has created the necessity to monitor the shoreline boundaries regularly. This study investigates the perspective of implementing artificial intelligence techniques to model and predict the realignment in shoreline along the eastern Indian coast of Orissa (now called Odisha). The modeling consists of analyzing the satellite images and corresponding reanalysis data of the coastline. The satellite images (Landsat imagery) of the Orissa coastline were analyzed using edge detection filters, mainly Sobel and Canny. Sobel and canny filters use edge detection techniques to extract essential information from satellite images. Edge detection reduces the volume of data and filters out worthless information while securing significant structural features of satellite images. The image differencing technique is used to determine the shoreline shift from GIS images (Landsat imagery). The shoreline shift dataset obtained from the GIS image is used together with the metrological dataset extracted from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2, and tide and wave parameter obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast for the period 1985-2015, as input parameter in machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the shoreline shift. Artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm are used as a ML model in the present study. The ML model contains weights that are multiplied with relevant inputs/features to obtain a better prediction. The analysis shows wind speed and wave height are the most prominent features in shoreline shift prediction. The model's performance was compared, and the observed result suggests that the ANN model outperforms the KNN and SVM model with an accuracy of 86.2%.

TI  - Reconstructing Global Chlorophyll-a Variations Using a Non-linear Statistical Approach
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the spatio-temporal variations of surface chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl, a proxy of phytoplankton biomass) greatly benefited from the availability of continuous and global ocean color satellite measurements from 1997 onward. These two decades of satellite observations are however still too short to provide a comprehensive description of Chl variations at decadal to multi-decadal timescales. This paper investigates the ability of a machine learning approach (a non-linear statistical approach based on Support Vector Regression, hereafter SVR) to reconstruct global spatio-temporal Chl variations from selected surface oceanic and atmospheric physical parameters. With a limited training period (13 years), we first demonstrate that Chl variability from a 32-years global physical-biogeochemical simulation can generally be skillfully reproduced with a SVR using the model surface variables as input parameters. We then apply the SVR to reconstruct satellite Chl observations using the physical predictors from the above numerical model and show that the Chl reconstructed by this SVR more accurately reproduces some aspects of observed Chl variability and trends compared to the model simulation. This SVR is able to reproduce the main modes of interannual Chl variations depicted by satellite observations in most regions, including El Nino signature in the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. In stark contrast with the trends simulated by the biogeochemical model, it also accurately captures spatial patterns of Chl trends estimated by satellite data, with a Chl increase in most extratropical regions and a Chl decrease in the center of the subtropical gyres, although the amplitude of these trends are underestimated by half. Results from our SVR reconstruction over the entire period (1979-2010) also suggest that the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation drives a significant part of decadal Chl variations in both the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. Overall, this study demonstrates that non-linear statistical reconstructions can be complementary tools to in situ and satellite observations as well as conventional physical-biogeochemical numerical simulations to reconstruct and investigate Chl decadal variability.

TI  - Assessment of groundwater potential zones using multi-criteria evaluation technique of Paisuni River Basin from the combined state of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Paisuni River Basin forms the combined state of Uttar Pradesh (UP), and Madhya Pradesh (MP), India. It is an agricultural-dominated area in the flood plains where groundwater plays a crucial role for agricultural purpose. In the present study, an assessment of groundwater potential (GWP) zones is carried out using multi-criteria evaluation techniques. Different thematic maps such as landuse/landcover, geomorphology, lithology, soil, slope, lineament, drainage and rainfall maps were considered for the delineation of potential zones. The present work was carried out to delineate the GWP for the two different states as well as for the various villages of UP and MP. Approximately, 44% and 13% for good potential, 32% and 18% for moderate potential and 6% and 14% for the low potential of groundwater are delineated from the states of UP and MP. The village wise shows that 1% good potential is in the state of MP; however, 99% shows good potential for the villages of UP. Rainfall data also indicates that UP receives more annual rainfall than MP. The majority of the area in UP suggests good groundwater potential zones. Thus, the results will be helpful in better planning and management of groundwater resources in the Paisuni River Basin as well as rainwater harvesting in different villages where there is a poor potential of groundwater to meet the future need of water in these villages.

TI  - Statistical modelling of drought-related yield losses using soil moisture-vegetation remote sensing and multiscalar indices in the south-eastern Europe
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological and agricultural information coupled with remote sensing observations has been used to assess the effectiveness of satellite-derived indices in yield estimations. The estimate yield models generated by both the regression (MLR) and Bayesian network (BBN) algorithms and their levels of predictive skill were assessed. The enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), soil water index (SWI), standardized precipitation evaporation index (SPEI) have been considered predictors for three rainfed crops (maize, sunflower and grapevine) grown in 37 districts in the Republic of Moldova (RM). We used the weekly EVI2, which was collected by MODIS instruments aboard the Terra satellite with a 250m x 250m spatial resolution and aggregated for each district during the 2000-2018 period. We also used the weekly SWI, which was collected from the ASCAT instruments with a 12 km x 12 km spatial resolution and aggregated for each district at the topsoil (0-40 cm; SWI-12) and the root-zone layer (0-100 cm; SWI-14) during 2000-2018. The multiscalar SPEI during 1951-2018 farming years proved to be a significant addition to the remote sensing indices and led to the development of a model that improved the yield assessment. The study also summarized (i) the optimal time window of satellite-derived SWIi and EVI2i for yield estimation, and (ii) the capability of remotely sensed indices for representing the spatio-temporal variations of agricultural droughts. We developed statistical soil-vegetation-atmosphere models to explore drought-related yield losses. The skill scores of the sunflower MLR and BBN models were higher than those for the maize and grape models and were able to estimate yields with reasonable accuracy and predictive power. The accurate estimation of maize, sunflower and grapevine yields was observed two months before the harvest (RMSE of similar to 1.2 tha-1). Despite the fact that summer crops (maize, sunflower) are able to develop a root system that uses the entire root zone depth, however, the SWI-12 had the stronger correlation with crop yield, then SWI-14. This explains much better the fit between yields of the crops and SWI-12, which represents soil moisture anomaly in the key rooting layer of soil. In any case, all summer crops showed negative correlations with each of the remote sensing soil moisture indices in the early and middle of the growing season, with SWI-12 performing better than SWI-14. Based on the crop-specific soil moisture model, we found that topsoil moisture declines in the most drought-susceptible crop growth stages, which indicates that RM is a good candidate for studying drought persists as main driver of rainfed yield losses in the south-eastern Europe.

TI  - A trend of increasing burned areas in Iraq from 2001 to 2019
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires have an important role in the ecological process affecting ecosystems at multiple spatial scales. MCD64A1 500 m burned area product is used in this study to document trends of fire events from 2001 to 2019. The research aims to analyze the trend of burned areas in the country. Iraq is selected as study area of the research because of dramatically increasing the number of fires in the country. The study found that the lowest amount of burned areas were located in the center and southwest, while northeast and north faced most of the fires. The trend of burned areas in Iraq was an increase of 71.7 km(2)per year, and, principally, in the last years, burned areas increased by 1363 km(2). The most extensive burning areas occurred in the Ninawa Governorate (29%). In 2019, burned areas increased to around eight times compared to the yearly average. During 2019, one of the highest classes which contain burned area is "Cropland, rainfed" with 4366 km(2)burned. High maximum air temperature and wind speed are the main factors that contribute to increasing burned areas; however, high precipitation and air pressure lead to a reducing amount of burned areas. The rapid increase of fires in the country as a result of burn crop field residues will lead to worsening air pollution and likely decrease forest area in the future.

TI  - Potential of using spectral vegetation indices for corn green biomass estimation based on their relationship with the photosynthetic vegetation sub-pixel fraction
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop biomass (Bio) is one of the most important parameters of a crop, and knowledge of it before harvest is essential to help farmers in their decision making. Both green and dry Bio can be estimated from vegetation spectral indices (VIs) because they have a close relationship with accumulated absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), which is proportional to total Bio. The aims of this study were to analyze the potential capacity of spectral vegetation indices in estimating corn green biomass based on their relationship with the photosynthetic vegetation sub-pixel fraction derived from spectral mixture analysis and to analyze the best interval of VI accumulation (days) for corn grain yield estimation. Field data of center pivots cultivated with corn during the irrigation seasons of 2015 and 2018 and Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images were used. The EVI produced the best results; Pearson's correlation coefficient, RMSE and Willmott's index reached 0.99, 6.5%, and 0.948, respectively. Among the nine potential VIs analyzed, the EVI, SAVI and OSAVI were considered the first, second and third best performing for corn green Bio estimation, respectively, based on their comparison to the photosynthetic vegetation sub-pixel fraction (fPV), and the time intervals that extended until 120 days after sowing showed the best results for corn grain yield estimation.

TI  - In Situ Assessment of Donghu Lake China Using Rare Minnow (<i>Gobiocypris rarus)</i>
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) was applied as a sentinel organism and set in cages at control and test sampling sites in Donghu Lake for 4 weeks in March, June, September, and December 2016 to assess the biological toxicity of in situ water. Sampling for active biomonitoring and physicochemical variables was performed weekly. The control was obtained from the outdoor pool of the Institute of Hydrobiology, China. Superoxide dismutase, lipoperoxidation, metallothioneins, acetylcholinesterase activity, and Vtg mRNA expression were determined as biomarkers during the field exposure period. Survival and growth also were monitored to evaluate the overall physiological condition of the fish. The seasonal changes of organic pollutants and trace metals (As, Hg, Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) in surface water were determined. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) index was applied to summarize biomarker responses and correlate stress levels with concentrations of organic pollutants and trace metals in the surface water. Results indicated that complex pollution by persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals was present in Donghu Lake and that the in situ exposed organisms were stressed. Moreover, the complex pollution of Donghu Lake in summer and autumn was more serious than that in spring and winter. Active biomonitoring combined with IBR analysis enabled good discrimination among different exposure seasons. The proposed protocol with caged rare minnow revealed marked biological effects caused by the investigated Lake and a useful approach that can easily be extended to monitor water pollution.

TI  - Outstanding Challenges of Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrievals
T2  - SPACE SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Spectral retrieval has long been a powerful tool for interpreting planetary remote sensing observations. Flexible, parameterised, agnostic models are coupled with inversion algorithms in order to infer atmospheric properties directly from observations, with minimal reliance on physical assumptions. This approach, originally developed for application to Earth satellite data and subsequently observations of other Solar System planets, has been recently and successfully applied to transit, eclipse and phase curve spectra of transiting exoplanets. In this review, we present the current state-of-the-art in terms of our ability to accurately retrieve information about atmospheric chemistry, temperature, clouds and spatial variability; we discuss the limitations of this, both in the available data and modelling strategies used; and we recommend approaches for future improvement.

TI  - Serotype distribution of<i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>among healthy carriers and clinical patients: a systematic review from Iran
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniaeis associated with high morbidity and mortality in the world. Commercially licensed and available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) contain 10 (PCV10) and 13 (PCV13) pneumococcal serotypes. The most common serotypes ofS. pneumoniaecausing clinical diseases and carriers ofS. pneumoniaein Iran are not yet known. Reviewing and reporting trends in the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes in Iran will be useful for policy-making as PCV is being introduced into Iran's routine immunization program. Here, we report a systematic literature review of studies regardingS. pneumoniaeserotype distribution in clinical and carrier patients in Iran. MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Embase, Ovid, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Iranian Database were used to identify relevant papers published from 1 January 2000 to 21 August 2019. The search returned 8 relevant articles. Among serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD), serotype 23F (16.4%) was the most circulating serotype followed by 19F (15.2%), 19A (11.3%), 6A/B (9.2%), 9 V (5.8%), and 11A (5.14%). In carrier patients, the most common serotypes were, in rank order, 6A/B (10%), 19F (9%), 14(6.2%), 17F (4.8%), and 20(4.5%). Vaccine coverage among IPD patients would be 67.1% for PCV10-TT and 73.8% for PCV13. The present review demonstrates that the serotypes which were most responsible for disease in Iran are included in PCV10-TT and PCV13. However, sentinel surveillance must be continued in representative parts of the country to assess changing trends in the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes and their implications for vaccine selection and rollout in Iran.

TI  - Impact of scale-aware deep convection on the cloud liquid and ice water paths and precipitation using the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS-v5.2)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud liquid water path (LWP), ice water path (IWP), and precipitation simulated with uniform- and variable-resolution numerical experiments using the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) are compared against Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data. Our comparison between monthly-mean model diagnostics and satellite data focuses on the convective activity regions of the tropical Pacific Ocean, extending from the Tropical Eastern Pacific Basin where trade wind boundary layer clouds develop to the Western Pacific Warm Pool characterized by deep convective updrafts capped with extended upper-tropospheric ice clouds. Using the scale-aware Grell-Freitas (GF) and Multi-scale Kain-Fritsch (MSKF) convection schemes in conjunction with the Thompson cloud microphysics, uniform-resolution experiments produce large biases between simulated and satellite-retrieved LWP, IWP, and precipitation. Differences in the treatment of shallow convection lead the LWP to be strongly overestimated when using GF, while being in relatively good agreement when using MSKF compared to CERES data. Over areas of deep convection, uniform- and variable-resolution experiments overestimate the IWP with both MSKF and GF, leading to strong biases in the top-of-the-atmosphere longwave and shortwave radiation relative to satellite-retrieved data. Mesh refinement over the Western Pacific Warm Pool does not lead to significant improvement in the LWP, IWP, and precipitation due to increased grid-scale condensation and upward vertical motions. Results underscore the importance of evaluating clouds, their optical properties, and the top-of-the-atmosphere radiation budget in addition to precipitation when performing mesh refinement global simulations.

TI  - Challenges in sentinel node pathology in the era of adjuvant treatment
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background With the approval of adjuvant therapy for stage III melanoma, accurate staging is more important than ever. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is an accurate staging tool, yet the presence of capsular nevi (CN) can lead to a false-positive diagnosis. Patients and Methods Retrospective analysis of the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition stage IIIA melanoma patients who were treated at our institute between 2000 and 2015. SNB slides were reviewed for this study by an expert melanoma pathologist. Results Of 159 eligible patients, 14 originally diagnosed with metastatic melanoma merely had CN (8.8%). Another two merely had melanophages (1.3%). Thus, 10.1% of SNs were considered false positive after revision. In 12 patients, the SN tumor burden was originally reported as larger than 1 mm but turned out to be less than 1 mm. Four patients originally reported as SN tumor burden less than 1 mm before revision turned out to have larger than 1 mm. These patients might have been over- or undertreated in the current era of adjuvant therapy for stage III melanoma. Conclusions Distinguishing metastatic melanoma from benign CN and melanophages can be a diagnostic challenge. We plead for an expert pathologists' review, especially when using the SNB + results to determine treatment consequences.

TI  - Kounis syndrome after patent blue dye injection for sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Kounis syndrome (KS) has been described as an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) associated with an anaphylactic reaction. Several triggers have been identified and the diagnostic and treatment process can be challenging. Case A 58-year-old, female patient diagnosed with breast cancer and no history of allergies had subcutaneous injection of patent blue V dye for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Intraoperatively, she developed anaphylactic shock and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). A few hours later, electrocardiographic alterations and elevation of blood troponin were observed. Emergency coronary angiography revealed no occlusive lesions in coronary vessels. Further investigation in the allergy department set the diagnosis of KS. Conclusion There are just ten cases of perioperative KS in the literature so far and here we present the first one triggered by patent blue V dye for sentinel node biopsy.

TI  - Multitemporal time series analysis using machine learning models for ground deformation in the Erhai region, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground deformation (GD) has been widely reported as a global issue and is now an ongoing problem that will profoundly endanger the public safety. GD is a complex and dynamic problem with many contributing factors that occur over time. In the literature, there are only a few methods that can effectively monitor GD. Microwave remote sensing data such as interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) are mostly adopted to assess GD. These data can reveal the surface deforming areas with great precision, mapping GD results at a large scale. In this study, the effects of GD and the influencing factors, such as the building area, the water level, the cumulative precipitation, and the cumulative temperature, are modeled in the Erhai region with small baseline subset interferometric SAR (SBAS-InSAR) data that are applied using machine learning (ML) methods. The ML methods, namely, multiple linear regression (MLR), multilayer perceptron backpropagation (MLP-BP), least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), and particle swarm optimization (PSO)-LSSVM, are used to predict GD, and the results are compared. Particularly, the PSO-LSSVM method has obtained the least root mean square error (RMSE) and mean relative error (MRE) of 11.448 and 0.112, respectively. Therefore, the results have proven that the proposed PSO-LSSVM is very efficient in analyzing GD.

TI  - Tracking conservation effectiveness in the Vhembe Biosphere Reserve in South Africa using Landsat imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biosphere reserves (BRs) seek to reconcile a sustainable relationship between human welfare and environmental integrity by adopting a landscape model that distinguishes between three interdependent management zones (core, buffer, transition). Considering the increasing human influence on landscapes in BRs, the tracking land use-land cover (LULC) dynamics is crucial for the development and planning of efficient management strategies for specific management zone. This study aimed at (i) assessing biodiversity protection around the core zones to highlight the threats facing the core zones and (ii) tracking the effect of the proclamation of the Vhembe Biosphere Reserve (VBR) on the LULC dynamics in the management zones through spatio-temporal analysis using Landsat imagery acquired from1999 to 2018. Six LULC categories (water body, forest/bush, shrubs/grass, agricultural land, bare soil, and built-up/mines) were identified and mapped using the support vector machine (SVM) classification to address both objectives. Assessment of threats around the core zones using artificial buffers (0-5, 10-15, and 15-20 km radius) created around them showed agricultural activities in the most immediate buffers (0-5 km radius). The LULC dynamics showed vegetation increase in all the management zones evidenced by the reduction of bare soil as well shrub/grass lands, and by the corresponding increase in foliage-richer forest/bush lands since the proclamation of the reserve in 2009. The findings might signify a positive outcome of vegetation increase as a consequence of the proclamation of the VBR. However, firmer conservation measures must be adopted and priority must be given to the arrangement of the management zones to strengthen biodiversity protection in the core zone.

TI  - Direct fluorescence imaging of lignocellulosic and suberized cell walls in roots and stems
T2  - AOB PLANTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating plant structure is fundamental in botanical science and provides crucial knowledge for the theories of plant evolution, ecophysiology and for the biotechnological practices. Modern plant anatomy often targets the formation, localization and characterization of cellulosic, lignified or suberized cell walls. While classical methods developed in the 1960s are still popular, recent innovations in tissue preparation, fluorescence staining and microscopy equipment offer advantages to the traditional practices for investigation of the complex lignocellulosic walls. Our goal is to enhance the productivity and quality of microscopy work by focusing on quick and cost-effective preparation of thick sections or plant specimen surfaces and efficient use of direct fluorescent stains. We discuss popular histochemical microscopy techniques for visualization of cell walls, such as autofluorescence or staining with calcofluor, Congo red (CR), fluorol yellow (FY) and safranin, and provide detailed descriptions of our own approaches and protocols. Autofluorescence of lignin in combination with CR and FY staining can clearly differentiate between lignified, suberized and unlignified cell walls in root and stem tissues. Glycerol can serve as an effective clearing medium as well as the carrier of FY for staining of suberin and lipids allowing for observation of thick histological preparations. Three-dimensional (3D) imaging of all cell types together with chemical information by wide-field fluorescence or confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was achieved.

TI  - Religions going nuts? Faith-based veganism and transformative learning in the context of sustainability transitions (case 1: The Hare Krishna movement)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper is based on several years of ethnographic and desk-based research studying the Hare Krishna movement. The work is the first in a series exploring how segments of specific faith communities embrace dietary veganism and how this relates to the concept of transformational learning/change in the context of sustainability transitions. The focus is on how these communities embrace a plant-based diet representing different rationales and attitudes of learning in the process of organisational change. Design/methodology/approach I investigated Krishna practices extensively by visiting and volunteering in several of its farm communities in Europe. I used the mixed method of qualitative observations, participation, in-depth interviews and email interviews during a period of ten weeks spent in the communities altogether. I had not been in contact with Hare Krishna believers before the fieldwork. Findings Krishna veganism is analysed in the context of sustainability transitions by drawing on the concept of transformative (third-order) learning/change. Findings reveal an unexpected tendency to veganism despite the movement's worldview and radical commitment to dairy consumption. By calling into question their own collective dietary paradigm, the Hare Krishna community provides an exemplary case of third-order learning and change in an organisational context. Originality/value The paper invites scholars to include third-order learning into sustainability transitions frameworks while aiming to address the shortcomings of theorising levels of learning. The connection between Krishna veganism, third-order learning and sustainability transitions has not been put forward before.

TI  - Epidemiology of Influenza among patients with influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory illness in Pakistan: A 10-year surveillance study 2008-17
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Pakistan, the burden of influenza was largely unknown, as no formal surveillance system was in place. In 2008, an influenza surveillance system was set up in eight sentinel sites. This study describes the epidemiology of influenza virus using a 10-year surveillance data from 2008 to 2017. Nasopharyngeal/throat swabs were collected from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) along with relevant epidemiological information. The samples were tested using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the detection and characterization of influenza viruses. A total of 17 209 samples were tested for influenza, out of which 3552 (20.6%) were positive; 2151/11 239 (19.1%) were patients with ILI, whereas 1401/5970 (23.5%) were patients with SARI. Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 was the predominant strain with 40.6% (n = 1442) followed by influenza B (936, 26.4%). Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 was predominant among the children (5-14 years) and adults (15-64 years). Influenza B strain was predominantly found in the elderly age group (>= 65 years) accounting for 48% of cases followed by children (2-4 years) accounting for 37% of cases. This 10-year surveillance data provides evidence of influenza activity in the country throughout the year with seasonal winter peaks. The results could be used to strengthen the epidemic preparedness and response plan.

TI  - Establishing seasonal and alert influenza thresholds in Morocco
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSeveral statistical methods of variable complexity have been developed to establish thresholds for influenza activity that may be used to inform public health guidance. We compared the results of two methods and explored how they worked to characterize the 2018 influenza season performance-2018 season.MethodsHistorical data from the 2005/2006 to 2016/2018 influenza season performance seasons were provided by a network of 412 primary health centers in charge of influenza like illness (ILI) sentinel surveillance. We used the WHO averages and the moving epidemic method (MEM) to evaluate the proportion of ILI visits among all outpatient consultations (ILI%) as a proxy for influenza activity. We also used the MEM method to evaluate three seasons of composite data (ILI% multiplied by percent of ILI with laboratory-confirmed influenza) as recommended by WHO.ResultsThe WHO method estimated the seasonal ILI% threshold at 0.9%. The annual epidemic period began on average at week 46 and lasted an average of 18weeks. The MEM model estimated the epidemic threshold (corresponding to the WHO seasonal threshold) at 1.5% of ILI visits among all outpatient consultations. The annual epidemic period began on week 49 and lasted on average 14weeks. Intensity thresholds were similar using both methods. When using the composite measure, the MEM method showed a clearer estimate of the beginning of the influenza epidemic, which was coincident with a sharp increase in confirmed ILI cases.ConclusionsWe found that the threshold methodology presented in the WHO manual is simple to implement and easy to adopt for use by the Moroccan influenza surveillance system. The MEM method is more statistically sophisticated and may allow a better detection of the start of seasonal epidemics. Incorporation of virologic data into the composite parameter as recommended by WHO has the potential to increase the accuracy of seasonal threshold estimation.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Fusion of Remote Sensing Image Based on Deep Learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data play an important role in monitoring the rapid change of the earth surface. However, there is an irreconcilable contradiction between the spatial and temporal resolutions of the remote sensing image acquired from a same sensor. The spatiotemporal fusion technology for remote sensing data is an effective way to solve the contradiction. In this paper, we will study the spatiotemporal fusion method based on the convolutional neural network, which can fuse the Landsat data with high spatial but low temporal resolution and MODIS data with low spatial but high temporal resolution, and generate time series data with high spatial resolution. In order to improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal fusion, a residual convolution neural network is proposed. MODIS image is used as the input to predict the residual image between MODIS and Landsat, and the sum of the predicted residual image and MODIS data is used as the predicted Landsat-like image. In this paper, the residual network not only increases the depth of the superresolution network but also avoids the problem of vanishing gradient due to the deep network structure. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy by our method is greater than that of several mainstream methods.

TI  - Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography and blue dye methods in detection of sentinel lymph nodes following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in initially node positive breast cancer
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Recent studies show that contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) using SonoVue has the potential to improve the performance of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with early breast cancer. However, the evidence of SLNB using CEUS in patients converting from cN1 to cN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is lacking. The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the feasibility of CEUS using SonoVue for the identification of sentinel lymph node (SLN) and the value of the combination of CEUS and blue dye (BD) for SLNB in patients converting from cN1 to cN0 following NAC. Methods Patients with cytology-proven node positive breast cancer at the initial diagnosis (stage T1-T3N1M0) from January 2018 to January 2019, underwent NAC. Patients converting from cN1 to cN0 following NAC were enrolled and randomized into two groups for SLNB: the combination method group using CEUS and BD together, and the single BD method group. Then all patients underwent complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and primary breast surgery. Compared with the final pathological results, the identification rate, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, false negative rate, negative predictive value, positive predictive value were recorded and compared between two methods. Results A total of 400 patients with stage T1-T3N1M0 disease underwent NAC between January 2018 to January 2019, among which 134 (33.5%) patients had clinically negative node confirmed by imaging after NAC and randomized into two groups. Each group included 67 cases. In the combination method group, contrast-enhanced lymphatic vessels in 66 cases of 67 were clearly visualized by US soon after the periareolar injection of SonoVue and the SLNs were accurately localized. The identification rate of the combination method was 98.5%%, which was significantly higher than 83.6% (56/67) using the single BD method. The mean numbers of SLNs identified by the combination method was higher than that by the single BD method. Compared with pathological diagnosis, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, the positive predictive value, the negative predictive value, and the FNR of the combingation method were 84.4%, 100%, 89.4%, 100%, 75%, and 15.6%, respectively. In contrast, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, the positive predictive value, the negative predictive value, and the FNR using single blue dye were 73.9%, 100%, 89.3%, 100%, 84.6%, and 26.1%, respectively. The FNR using the combination method was significantly lower than that using single BD. Conclusion Identification of SLNs in patients converting from cN1 to cN0 following NAC by CEUS is a technically feasible. The combination of CEUS and BD is more effective than BD alone for SLNB in patients converting from cN1 to cN0 following NAC.

TI  - A Review on Advances in Intra-operative Imaging for Surgery and Therapy: Imagining the Operating Room of the Future
T2  - ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - With the advent of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), intra-operative imaging has become crucial for surgery and therapy guidance, allowing to partially compensate for the lack of information typical of MIS. This paper reviews the advancements in both classical (i.e. ultrasounds, X-ray, optical coherence tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) and more recent (i.e. multispectral, photoacoustic and Raman imaging) intra-operative imaging modalities. Each imaging modality was analyzed, focusing on benefits and disadvantages in terms of compatibility with the operating room, costs, acquisition time and image characteristics. Tables are included to summarize this information. New generation of hybrid surgical room and algorithms for real time/in room image processing were also investigated. Each imaging modality has its own (site- and procedure-specific) peculiarities in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, field of view and contrasted tissues. Besides the benefits that each technique offers for guidance, considerations about operators and patient risk, costs, and extra time required for surgical procedures have to be considered. The current trend is to equip surgical rooms with multimodal imaging systems, so as to integrate multiple information for real-time data extraction and computer-assisted processing. The future of surgery is to enhance surgeons eye to minimize intra- and after-surgery adverse events and provide surgeons with all possible support to objectify and optimize the care-delivery process.

TI  - Estimation of the recession rate of Gangotri glacier, Garhwal Himalaya (India) through kinematic GPS survey and satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snout monitoring of the Gangotri glacier (Uttarakhand, India) during the ablation season (May to September) in years 2005 and 2015 by using rapid static and kinematic GPS survey reveals that the retreating rate has been comparatively more declined than shown by the earlier studies. Our study is based on the individual measurement by the remote sensing, added by the ground observations by using Differential global positioning system (DGPS) to determine the precise recession rate of the glacier at sub-centimeter level of accuracy. The GPS dataset show that the total average retreat along the snout has been 102.57 +/- 0.05 m from 2005 to 2015 with an average rate as 10.26 +/- 0.05 m/yr. Additionally, the shift in snout position was also measured through multi-temporal satellite data from 1989 to 2016. The results indicate that the Gangotri glacier snout has retreated by 585.62 +/- 38.30 m during this period with an average retreat of 26.75 +/- 4.36 m/yr from 1989 to 1999, 21.58 +/- 3.77 m/yr from 1999 to 2009 and 14.60 +/- 4.81 m/yr from 2009 to 2016. Such a decline in retreat is further confirmed by the satellite data set. A close examination of meltwater discharge and retreating rate (r(2)=0.95) show that both parameters are strongly correlated. Therefore, we suggest that a consistent decrease in meltwater discharge from 1999 to 2015 is in agreement with decreasing trend of retreating rate during the recent years. To determine the possible causes of decreased retreating rate, a relationship between debris thickness and melt rate was also established by ablation stakes. Further, we infer that the declining trend in the glacier retreat is not only controlled by prevailing weather conditions (rainfall and air temperature) but is also governed by increased debris cover on the glacier surface which prevents the ice to melt.

TI  - Snow Moving to Higher Elevations: Analyzing Three Decades of Snowline Dynamics in the Alps
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Alps, snow cover dynamics can be monitored using Earth observation (EO). However, low revisit frequency and cloud cover pose a challenge to long-term time series analysis using high spatial resolution EO images. In this study, we applied the random forest regression to model regional snowline elevations (RSEs). In this manner, daily snowline dynamics and their long-term trends can be derived, despite the aforementioned challenges. Of the six investigated Alpine catchments between 1984 and 2018, a significant increasing trend of RSEs is shown in four catchments in the early ablation seasons (between 5.38 2.64 and 11.29 4.79 m center dot a(-1)) and five catchments in the middle ablation seasons (between 4.17 2.62 and 8.76 4.42 m center dot a(-1)). On average, the random forest regression models can explain 75% of the RSE variations. Furthermore, air temperature was found influential in snow persistence especially during middle and late ablation seasons.Plain Language Summary Snow cover in mountainous regions has been changing worldwide due to climate change in the past few decades. Most existing studies focused on snow cover areal variations in the latitudinal-longitudinal direction, while the understanding of snow cover dynamics in the altitudinal direction is limited. This study aims to provide a new method to derive snowline dynamics in the Alps using a machine learning technique. The results show that there has been a significantly hastened snowline recession during the period 1984-2018 within most of the investigated areas. These results could help to identify climate sensitivity areas at a local scale, where the snowline thereof are retreating increasingly faster. We found a high correlation between monthly regional snowline elevation anomalies and monthly air temperature anomalies especially during the middle and late ablation seasons. In the future, the cooperation between remote sensing scientists and environmental modelers is highly desired, not only to reduce the uncertainties in snowline modeling but also to enhance our knowledge of climate-snowline-runoff interactions at regional scales and hence develop effective adaptation strategies.

TI  - Rainfall-surface runoff estimation for the Lower Bhavani basin in south India using SCS-CN model and geospatial techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall and surface runoff are the two most important components, which control the groundwater recharge of the basin. The long-term groundwater recharge of an aquifer gets affected by the population growth, irregular agriculture activities and industrialization. Hence, estimation of rainfall-surface runoff is very much essential for proper groundwater management practices. In the present study, Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) model was employed in combination with geospatial techniques to estimate rainfall-surface runoff for the Lower Bhavani River basin in South India. To develop the SCS-CN model, rainfall data were obtained for 33 years (1983-2015) from 22 rain gauge stations spread over the basin. IRS LISS-IV satellite data of 5.8 m spatial resolution were used to analyze the land use/land cover (LU/LC) behavior. Based on the soil properties, four Hydrological Soil Groups (HSG) were identified in the basin which is most significant for surface runoff estimation. Curve Number (CN) values were obtained for various Antecedent Moisture Conditions (AMC) such as dry condition (AMC I), average condition (AMC II) and wet condition (AMC III). Spatial distribution of CN values was plotted using Geographical Information System (GIS) for the entire Lower Bhavani Basin to assess the surface runoff potential. The results indicate that the annual rainfall varies from 267 mm (2002) to 1528.6 mm (2005), and the annual surface runoff varies from 102.04 mm (1985) to 463.02 mm (2010). The SCS-CN model outputs predict that the average surface runoff of the basin is 211.99 mm, and the average surface runoff volume is 81,995,380 m(3). The study also indicates that nearly 53% of the basin area is dominated by high to very high surface runoff potential. Finally, the output of surface runoff potential was validated with the Average Groundwater Level Fluctuation (AGLF) observed in 57 wells spread over the entire basin. The basin AGLF ranges from 2.32 to 21.72 m. The surface runoff potential categories are satisfactorily matching with the AGLF categories. Moderate surface runoff as well as moderate AGLF zones mostly occupy the central portion of the basin, which possess good groundwater potential. However, the high surface runoff zones in the basin lead more surface water flow into the river channels, which reduce the infiltration rate and decline the water table. This problem can be solved by constructing suitable artificial groundwater recharge structures across the river channels in the high surface runoff potential areas.

TI  - Satellite Observed Positive Impacts of Fog on Vegetation
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fog is an important water source for many ecosystems, especially in drylands. Most fog-vegetation studies focus on individual plant scale; the relationship between fog and vegetation function at larger spatial scales remains unclear. This hinders an accurate prediction of climate change impacts on dryland ecosystems. To this end, we examined the effect of fog on vegetation utilizing both optical and microwave remote sensing-derived vegetation proxies and fog observations from two locations at Gobabeb and Marble Koppie within the fog-dominated zone of the Namib Desert. Significantly positive relationships were found between fog and vegetation attributes from optical data at both locations. The positive relationship was also observed for microwave data at Gobabeb. Fog can explain about 10%-30% of variability in vegetation proxies. These findings suggested that fog impacts on vegetation can be quantitatively evaluated from space using remote sensing data, opening a new window for research on fog-vegetation interactions.Plain Language Summary This study presents the first observed relationships between fog and vegetation function using satellite remote sensing data. Significant correlations were found between fog and satellite-derived vegetation indices at two study sites within the Namib Desert. These findings suggested that satellite data can be used to assess and quantify the impacts of fog on vegetation at large spatial scales.

TI  - DSM generation with bistatic TanDEM-X InSAR pairs and quality validation in inclined topographies and various land cover classes
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2007, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging was modified by TerraSAR-X (TSX); this second-generation SAR satellite offers up to 1 m of spatial resolution. The satellite is capable of interferometric SAR (InSAR), which permits the generation of digital surface models (DSMs). TSX was designed for monostatic InSAR imaging, but the potential for acquired DSMs is limited due to the disadvantages of repeat-pass InSAR geometry under the influence of temporal and related spectral decorrelations. In 2010, TanDEM-X (TDX) was launched to operate in a synchronized helix orbit with TSX to achieve high-quality DSMs covering almost the entire World in the basis of bistatic SAR imaging. In this paper, we focused on the DSM potential of TDX InSAR pairs in inclined topographies, and open, built-up, and forest land cover classes. A 5-m gridded TDX DSM was generated by interferometric processing and comprehensively analyzed by using model-to-model comparison approaches utilizing a reference airborne laser scanning (ALS) DSM. Absolute and relative vertical accuracies were estimated separately for all land cover classes using standard deviation and normalized median absolute deviation considering the influence of terrain tilt. Coherence with the reference DSM was determined by vertical profiles and frequency distribution graphics of height differences. Inaccurate regions were visualized by the generation of height error maps (HEMs). During the analysis, the qualities of the generated 5-m TSX DSM and a freely available 1-arcsecond (similar to 30 m) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DSM were validated and compared with TDX.

TI  - Morin treatment for acute ethanol exposure in rats
T2  - BIOTECHNIC & HISTOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ethanol intoxication increases oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory proteins, which cause neurodegeneration. Morin is a natural flavonoid obtained from plants of the Moraceae family that exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, anticancer and cardioprotective properties. We investigated the neuroprotective effect of morin on ethanol intoxicated rats. Rats exposed to ethanol exhibit increased cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, free fatty acids, and lipid oxidative byproducts, and decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes and membrane ATPase. We found that ethanol increased activation of microglia and astrocytes in the brain. Administration of morin to rats exposed to ethanol significantly decreased lipid oxidative byproducts, enhanced antioxidant enzymes, normalized lipid levels and decreased microglia and astrocyte activation. Morin exhibits neuroprotective properties against ethanol intoxication by increasing the antioxidant defense mechanism and decreasing the inflammatory response caused by neuroglia and astrocytes.

AB  - Much anticipation awaits the results of the SOUND trial, (Gentilini and Veronesi in Breast 21:678-681, 2012) which may prove the futility of performing sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in low-risk breast cancer patients. However, do we really not know the answer to the questions that the SOUND trial poses already? Consideration must be taken of the very much overlooked trials predating the sentinel node era, which risk stratified patients according to the absence of palpable lymphadenopathy and without dependence upon ultrasound imaging (clinically negative axilla). This automatically selects a low-risk group of patients for axillary disease (low axillary burden) and the relevance of these critical trials is discussed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the feasibility of using indocyanine green and robotic near infra-red fluorescent imaging (Firefly(R)) for sentinel lymph node biopsy in cN0 oral cavity cancer. Ten patients with early squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue (n = 8) and buccal mucosa (n = 2) were included. Peritumoral injection of 10 mg indocyanine green and real-time mapping of sentinel lymph nodes in the neck was performed using Firefly(R)via a retro-auricular trans-hairline incision. Sentinel lymph node was detected in all patients at 1.2 sentinel lymph node per person. Majority were situated in level II (91.7%). Mean time to detection of sentinel lymph node was 171.0 (68.0-312.0)s. Mean signal-to-background ratio was 5.62 (3.51-7.91). Frozen section of one sentinel lymph node was positive for malignancy, paraffin section of which confirmed the presence of metastatic disease. Modified radical neck dissection was performed for that particular patient, paraffin section of which did not show any tumor deposit. Frozen section and paraffin section of all other sentinel lymph nodes (n = 11) and neck dissection specimens yielded no malignancy. All resection margins were clear. Three patients completed adjuvant radiotherapy for pT2N0 (n = 2) and pT2N1 (n = 1) carcinoma of the tongue. Mean follow-up was 12.0 (4.0-18.0) months. All patients were alive at last follow-up with no disease recurrence. There were no adverse outcomes associated with the use of indocyanine green and robot-assisted neck dissection. Indocyanine green and Firefly(R)for sentinel lymph node biopsy in cN0 oral cavity cancer is feasible with no adverse effects.

TI  - Hierarchical classification of Sentinel 2-a images for land use and land cover mapping and its use for the CORINE system
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of the Sentinel-2 satellite for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. The commonly known supervised classification algorithms, support vector machines (SVMs), random forest (RF), and maximum likelihood (ML) classification are adopted for investigation along with a proposed hierarchical classification model based on a coordination of information on the environment land cover system. The main classes for land cover and mapping in the proposed hierarchical classification are selected as water, vegetation, built-up, and bare land in the first level, which is followed by inland water, marine water, forest/meadow, vegetated agricultural land, barren land, and nonvegetated agricultural land in the second level. The study areas for the experiments are selected as the two biggest cities of Turkey, namely Ankara and Izmir, providing a sufficient number of classes for comparison purposes. During the utilized hierarchical methodology, water and vegetation are first extracted using the normalized difference water and vegetation indices. This is followed by the selection of training pixels from the remaining classes to perform and compare different supervised learning algorithms for the first- and second-level classification in terms of accuracy rates. The experimental results first reveal that while the SVMs have close accuracy performances to those with RF, they are significantly superior to the ML classification, with an average of 8% accuracy rates for LULC mapping. Second, the hierarchical classification also gives higher performances with respect to the nonhierarchical classification, with the provided gains between 4% and 10% for class-based accuracies. The overall accuracy rates of the proposed hierarchical methodology are 85% and 84% for the first-level classes and 83% and 72% for the second-level classes, respectively, for Izmir and Ankara.

TI  - Development of an Automated Tool for Delineation of Flood Footprints from SAR Imagery for Rapid Disaster Response: A Case Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are one of the most common natural disasters. In recent times, microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images have been used widely for mapping flood affected areas due to its all-weather capability and acquisition during day and night. Here, in this paper, an automated algorithm is proposed to delineate flood extent from SAR images without any human intervention. The algorithm consists of pre-processing steps like applying orbit file, calibrate to sigma naught, speckle filtering, terrain correction and linear to decibel conversion. The water layer is delineated using multi-segmentation and Otsu's thresholding technique. Further, flood layer is extracted by postprocessing steps using majority filter, applying permanent water body mask and eliminating hill shadows. The algorithm is tested on a significant number of satellite images covering floods in India, which are having diverse terrain and flooding patterns. In this paper, the steps involved in delineating flood from SAR image of VH polarization from SENTINEL-1 satellite covering chronic flood-prone stretch of part of Ganga River in Bihar state is presented. Accuracy assessment is carried out with the flood layer derived from RADARSAT SAR HV polarized data acquired on the same day and an accuracy of about 96% is obtained. The total processing time taken for the extraction of the flood layer is 9 min. This automation process is beneficial for the generation of rapid flood inundation maps, with high accuracy, which is helpful for flood monitoring and relief management during a disaster.

TI  - Forests of History: Satellite Remote Sensing and Archaeological Survey in Southern Ghana
T2  - AFRICAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Archaeological research shows that people have inhabited the southern Ghanaian forest zone for millennia. Yet the cultural landscape is poorly known due to enormous logistical challenges that have frustrated survey efforts for the past century. Establishing long-term archaeological and regional perspectives on the settlement landscape and patterns of material culture is necessary to address larger social, political, and economic questions regarding the precolonial and pre-Atlantic history of West Africa. I argue that satellite remote sensing, combined with topographic data and traditional pedestrian survey methods, provides an important tool for surveying the forests of southern Ghana. These methods are used to identify settlement sites on hilltops and low rises in the coastal hinterlands occupied during the first and early second millennia AD. Satellite imagery is a useful tool not only for expediting archaeological survey but also for visualizing human relationships with the densely vegetated landscapes of West Africa.

TI  - <i>TP53</i>p.Arg337His geographic distribution correlates with adrenocortical tumor occurrence
T2  - MOLECULAR GENETICS & GENOMIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The p.Arg337His mutation of theTP53is the most frequent germline missense variant associated with cancer described so far in this gene. It is mainly found in the South and Southeastern regions of Brazil, where it has been associated with a high incidence of pediatric adrenocortical (ACT) and choroid plexus tumors. The frequency and geographic distribution of this mutation is largely unknown, except for the Parana State, where a mean prevalence of 0.27% was reported. In the present study, we developed a high-throughput method for p.Arg337His genotyping, what allowed us to determine the frequency and geographic distribution of this mutation in a cohort from the most populous state in Brazil. Methods Consecutive samples from 31,612 newborns from Sao Paulo State were screened for p.Arg337His. The allelic discrimination was done by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the presence of haplotype A3 in carriers was examined by using allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR, followed by nested-PCR to detect the SNP rs9894946. Results We found 67 (0.21%) samples positive for this mutation. The highest p.Arg337His frequencies were found in the cities close to the boundary between Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais State. No association could be found between p.Arg337His and gender, ethnicity, premature birth or twinning. Remarkably, a trend was found between the geographic distribution of p.Arg337His carriers and occurrence of ACT. Conclusion We presented for the first time the p.Arg337His frequency among individuals unselected for any disease from a subset of the Sao Paulo State, the most populous in Brazil. The allele discrimination assay we presented here has proven to be a reliable and efficient method for high-throughput genotyping. ACT was found to be a good sentinel cancer to suppose p.Arg337His presence in our region.

TI  - Interaction effects of the main drivers of global climate change on spatiotemporal dynamics of high altitude ecosystem behaviors: process-based modeling
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon and nitrogen (SOC-N) dynamics are indicative of the human-induced disturbances of the terrestrial ecosystems the quantification of which provides insights into interactions among drivers, pressures, states, impacts, and responses in a changing environment. In this study, a process-based model was developed to simulate the eight monthly outputs of net primary productivity (NPP), SOC-N pools, soil C:N ratio, soil respiration, total N emission, and sediment C-N transport effluxes for cropland, grassland, and forest on a hectare basis. The interaction effect of the climate change drivers of aridity, CO(2)fertilization, land-use and land-cover change, and best management practices was simulated on high altitude ecosystems from 2018 to 2070. The best management practices were developed into a spatiotemporally composite index based on SOC-N stock saturation, 4/1000 initiative, and RUCLE-C factor. Our model predictions differed from the remotely sensed data in the range of - 64% (underestimation) for the cropland NPP to 142% (overestimation) for the grassland SOC pool as well as from the global mean values in the range of - 97% for the sediment C and N effluxes to 60% for the total N emission from the grassland. The interaction exerted the greatest negative impact on the monthly sediment N efflux, total N emission, and soil respiration from forest by - 90.5, - 82.7, and - 80.3% and the greatest positive impact on the monthly sediment C effluxes from cropland, grassland, and forest by 139.3, 137.1, and 133.3%, respectively, relative to the currently prevailing conditions.

TI  - Application of satellite remote sensing to observe and analyse temporal changes of cocoa plantation in Ondo State, Nigeria
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the changes in the area of land occupied by cocoa plantation in Ondo state in order to provide useful information for effective agricultural policy to increase cocoa yield as the leading export agricultural commodity in Nigeria. Satellite remote sensing technique was employed using satellite imagery of year 2000, 2002, 2014 and 2015 respectively acquired from Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI. The land cover of the study area was classified into six classes of cocoa plantation, forest, light forest and grassland, water body, bare surface and rock outcrop as well as settlement area. The result revealed that cocoa plantation occupied 31.3% in 2000, 32.7% in 2002, 41.4% in 2014 and 41.6% in 2015 respectively which depicts gradual increased in the area of land covered by cocoa plantation and its yield at the expense of other land cover classes which prove the potency of this tree crop of generating huge amount of foreign earning for supplementing revenue derived from crude oil in Nigeria. The area of land of other themes changes at different proportions but attention was on the cocoa plantation theme being focus in this research.

TI  - Practical challenges in the conduct of pragmatic trials embedded in health plans: Lessons of IMPACT-AFib, an FDA-Catalyst trial
T2  - CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPACT-AFib was an 80,000-patient randomized clinical trial implemented by five US insurance companies (health plans) aimed at increasing the use of oral anticoagulants by individuals with atrial fibrillation who were at high risk of stroke and not on treatment. The underlying thesis was that patients could be change agents to initiate prescribing discussions with their providers. We tested the effect of mailing information to both patients and their providers. We used administrative medical claims and pharmacy dispensing data to identify eligible patients, to randomize them to an early or delayed intervention, and to assess clinical outcomes. The core data were analysis-ready datasets each site had created and curated for the FDA's Sentinel System, supplemented by updated "fresh" pharmacy and enrollment data to ensure eligibility at the time of intervention. Following mutually agreed upon procedures, sites linked to additional internal source data to implement the intervention-educational information mailed to patients and their providers in the early intervention arm, and to providers of patients in the delayed intervention arm approximately 12 months later. The primary analysis compares the early intervention arm to the delayed intervention arm, prior to the delayed intervention being conducted (i.e. compares intervention to non-intervention). The endpoints of interest were evidence of initiation of anticoagulation (primary) as well as clinical endpoints, including stroke and hospitalization for bleeding. Major challenges, some unanticipated, identified during the planning phase include convening multi-stakeholder investigator teams and advisors, addressing ethical concerns about not intervening in a usual care comparison group, and identifying and avoiding interference with sites' routine programs that were similar to the intervention. Needs and challenges during theimplementation phaseincluded the fact that even limited site-specific programming greatly increased time and effort, the need to refresh research data extracts immediately before outreach to patients and providers, potential difficulty identifying low-cost medications such as warfarin that may not be reimbursed by health plans and so not discoverable in dispensing data, the need to develop workarounds when "providers" in claims data were facilities, difficulty addressing clustering of patients by provider because providers can have multiple identifiers within and between health plans, and the need to anticipate loss to follow up because of health plan disenrollment or change in benefits. As pragmatic trials begin to shape evidence generation within clinical practice, investigators should anticipate issues inherent to claims data and working with multiple large sites. In IMPACT-AFib, we found that investing in collaboration and communication among all parties throughout all phases of the study helped ensure common understanding, early identification of challenges, and streamlined actual implementation.

TI  - Active SMS-based surveillance of adverse events following immunisation with influenza and pertussis-containing vaccines in Australian pregnant women using AusVaxSafety
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Maternal immunisation is important to protect both mother and baby, but safety concerns can lead to low uptake. AusVaxSafety participant-based surveillance actively monitors adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) in Australia. We aimed to analyse AEFI in the days following vaccination with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and/or reduced antigen diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (dTpa) in pregnant women in Australia.Methods: De-identified AEFI reports were solicited from vaccine recipients via automated SMS survey (using SmartVax software) following routine vaccination with IIV and/or dTpa at 219 national sentinel surveillance sites from 2015 to 2018. AEFI rates were compared by vaccine group (IIV alone, dTpa alone, or IIV and dTpa together), vaccine brand, trimester (IIV only) and vaccination period (April to August 2016-2018; IIV only). Women who had two vaccination encounters during surveillance were identified and AEFI rates compared for each dose.Results: Among 13,758 participants, overall AEFI rates were lower following IIV (4.9%) than dTpa (6.4%) or IIV and dTpa given concomitantly (7.4%). The AEFI profile was similar for both vaccines, with injection site reactions, tiredness, and headache most commonly reported. Injection site pain and swelling/redness were significantly more common in women who received dTpa than IIV. Reports of medical attendance following immunisation were similar (0.3%) for each vaccine group. AEFI rates did not differ by IIV brand (FluQuadri (R), Fluarix (R) Tetra), dTpa brand (Boostrix (R), Adacel (R)), or by trimester. Among women with sequential dTpa vaccinations, 6.0% (7/116) had an AEFI following their second dTpa dose.Conclusions: Self-reported AEFI rates did not differ by trimester (IIV), or by vaccine brand (IIV or dTpa). Concomitant influenza and pertussis vaccination was associated with more frequent, but low rates of minor, expected AEFI. These real world 'citizen science-based' data provide further reassuring evidence of the safety of maternal vaccination. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Surface-guided tomotherapy improves positioning and reduces treatment time: A retrospective analysis of 16 835 treatment fractions
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose In this study, we have quantified the setup deviation and time gain when using fast surface scanning for daily setup/positioning with weekly megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) and compared it to daily MVCT. Methods A total of 16 835 treatment fractions were analyzed, treated, and positioned using our TomoTherapy HD (Accuray Inc., Madison, USA) installed with a Sentinel optical surface scanning system (C-RAD Positioning AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Patients were positioned using in-room lasers, surface scanning and MVCT for the first three fractions. For the remaining fractions, in-room laser was used for setup followed by daily surface scanning with MVCT once weekly. The three-dimensional (3D) setup correction for surface scanning was evaluated from the registration between MVCT and the planning CT. The setup correction vector for the in-room lasers was assessed from the surface scanning and the MVCT to planning CT registration. The imaging time was evaluated as the time from imaging start to beam-on. Results We analyzed 894 TomoTherapy treatment plans from 2012 to 2018. Of all the treatment fractions performed with surface scanning, 90 % of the residual errors were within 2.3 mm for CNS (N = 284), 2.9 mm for H&N (N = 254), 8.7 mm for thorax (N = 144) and 10.9 for abdomen (N = 134) patients. The difference in residual error between surface scanning and positioning with in-room lasers was significant (P < 0.005) for all sites. The imaging time was assessed as total imaging time per treatment plan, modality, and treatment site and found that surface scanning significantly reduced patient on-couch time compared to MVCT for all treatment sites (P < 0.005). Conclusions The results indicate that daily surface scanning with weekly MVCT can be used with the current target margins for H&N, CNS, and thorax, with reduced imaging time.

TI  - Revisiting Late Pleistocene glacier dynamics north-west of the Feldberg, southern Black Forest, Germany
T2  - E&G QUATERNARY SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern Black Forest was temporarily covered by a similar to 1000 km(2) large ice cap during the Late Pleistocene. However, during the last glaciation maximum in the Alps the atmospheric circulation over Europe was presumably characterised by the advection of humid air masses from the Mediterranean Sea. As a consequence, the ice cap of the Black Forest was likely in a leeward position due to its location north of the Alps. This raises the question of whether it reached its last maximum extent simultaneously with the glaciers in the Alps. As modern dating techniques have hitherto not been applied to the southern Black Forest, the timing of the last local glaciation maximum remains poorly constrained. As a first step towards an independent regional glacier chronology, we present a critical re-examination of glacial landforms in the area north-west of the highest summit of the Black Forest (Feldberg, 1493 m a.s.l.). It relies on both the analysis of remote sensing data and field mapping. The review of previous studies highlights important disagreements regarding the location of ice-marginal positions and their correlation. In addition, our findings challenge earlier studies on the glaciation of the Black Forest: some previously described ice-marginal positions could not be confirmed, whereas some of the newly identified moraines are described for the first time. This highlights the need for detailed geomorphological investigations prior to the application of geochronological methods. A multi-ridged series of terminal moraines in one of the studied valleys, Sankt Wilhelmer Tal, is proposed as the main target for future dating. Due to discrepancies with earlier studies, future efforts should reinvestigate other key areas related to the last glaciation of the southern Black Forest.

TI  - Long-term brown carbon and smoke tracer observations in Bogota, Colombia: association with medium-range transport of biomass burning plumes
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Light-absorbing aerosols emitted during open biomass burning (BB) events such as wildfires and agricultural burns have a strong impact on the Earth's radiation budget through both direct and indirect effects. Additionally, BB aerosols and gas-phase emissions can substantially reduce air quality at local, regional, and global scales, negatively affecting human health. South America is one of largest contributors to BB emissions globally. After Amazonia, the BB emissions from wildfires and agricultural burns in the grassland plains of northern South America (NSA) are the most significant in the region. However, few studies have analyzed the potential impact of NSA BB emissions on regional air quality. Recent evidence suggests that seasonal variations in air quality in several major cities in NSA could be associated with open biomass burning emissions, but it is still uncertain to what extent those sources impact air quality in the region. In this work, we report on 3 years of continuous equivalent black carbon (eBC) and brown carbon (BrC) observations at a hilltop site located upwind of the city of Bogota, and we demonstrate its association with fires detected by the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in a 3000 km x 2000 km domain. Offline PM2.5 filter samples collected during three field campaigns were analyzed to quantify water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), organic and elemental carbon (OC/EC), and biomass burning tracers such as levoglucosan, galactosan, and potassium. MODIS active fire data and HYSPLIT back trajectories were used to identify potential biomass burning plumes transported to the city. We analyzed the relationship between BrC, WSOC, water-soluble potassium, and levoglucosan to identify signals of the regional transport of BB aerosols. Our results confirm that regional biomass burning transport from wildfires occurs annually during the months of January and April. The seasonality of eBC closely followed that of PM2.5 at the city air quality stations; however, the observed seasonality of BrC is distinctly different to that of eBC and strongly associated with regional fire counts. The strong correlation between BrC and regional fire counts was observed at daily, weekly, and monthly timescales. WSOC at the measurement site was observed to increase linearly with levoglucosan during high BB periods and to remain constant at similar to 2.5 mu gC m(-3) during the low BB seasons. Our findings show, for the first time in this region, that aged BB plumes can regularly reach densely populated areas in the Central Andes of northern South America. A source footprint analysis involving BrC observations, back trajectories, and remotely sensed fire activity shows that the eastern savannas in NSA are the main BB source region for the domain analyzed.

TI  - Correlation analysis of land surface temperature and topographic elements in Hangzhou, China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In addition to human activities, this study found that topography is also an important factor affecting land surface temperature (LST). In this paper, based on Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS remote sensing images, a radiative transfer model was adopted to retrieve the LST, and a maximum likelihood method was used to remove artificial environmental interference factors, such as water bodies and built-up lands. This paper aims to analyze the influence of topographic factors, such as elevation, slope, aspect and shaded relief, on the LST of Hangzhou. By means of a statistical analysis, we obtained the quantitative relationship between these factors and constructed a multiple linear regression model of terrain factors and LST. The research revealed the following findings: (1) in the study area, elevation and slope are negatively correlated with LST, and all the factors have linear relationships with LST. (2) The relationship between aspect and LST is not significant, and high values of LST are found on the southern, southeastern and southwestern slopes; the lowest values are found on the northern slopes. (3) There is a significant linear relationship between the values of the shaded relief map and LST, and the more shadows there are, the lower the LST value will be. (4) After comprehensive analysis of the influence of the abovementioned topographic factors on the LST, it is found that shaded relief has the greatest contribution and is positively correlated with LST. The influence of shaded relief on surface thermal environment should be paid more attention in the process of surface thermal environment work. The assessment of the influence degree of shaded relief and surface thermal environment should be the premise and basis for many other studies.

TI  - Sir George Gabriel Stokes, Bart (1819-1903): his impact on science and scientists
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lucasian Professor Sir George Gabriel Stokes was appointed joint-Secretary of the Royal Society in 1854, a post he held for the unprecedented period of 31 years, relinquishing the role when he succeeded T.H. Huxley as President in 1885. An eminent scientist of the Victorian era, Stokes explained fluorescence (he also coined the word) and his hydrodynamical formulae (the 'Navier-Stokes equations') remain ubiquitous today in the physics of any phenomenon involving fluid flows, from pipelines to glaciers to large-scale atmospheric perturbations. He also made seminal advances in optics and mathematics, and formulae that bear his name remain widely used today. The historiography however appears to understate Stokes's significant impact on science as unacknowledged collaborator on a wide range of scientific developments. His scientific peers regarded him as a mentor, advisor, designer of crucial experiments and, as editor of the Royal Society's scientific journals, arbiter of the standards of excellence in scientific communication to be attained before publication would be considered. Three brief case studies on Stokes's correspondence with Lord Kelvin, Sir William Crookes and the chemist Arthur Smithells exemplify how his impact was conveyed through the work of other scientists. This paper also begins consideration of why the character and worldview of Stokes led him to eschew personal reputation and profit for the sake of science and the Royal Society, and of how the development of the discipline of history of science has impacted on historiography relating to Stokes and others.This article is part of the theme issue 'Stokes at 200 (Part 1)'.

TI  - Improving a comprehensive remote sensing drought index (CRSDI) in the Western part of Iran
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous remote sensing indices have been introduced to investigate the drought. Hence, the purpose of this study was to develop a Comprehensive Remote Sensing Drought Index (CRSDI) using the strengths of the previous Remote Sensing Drought Indices (RSDIs). Eleven mostly used RSDIs were used to develop CRSDI. Aras and Karkheh basins were studied as representative of Western Iran. Vegetation indices and surface temperature were derived from the products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE (and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data were used to extract groundwater information. The performances of RSDIs were evaluated using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) acquired from 13 synoptic stations. The correlation coefficients between CRSDI against six-month SPI and nine-month SPI were obtained as 0.66 and 0.56, respectively. Then, the results proved the proper efficiency of the CRSDI to investigate the drought in the study area.

TI  - The AERONET Version 3 aerosol retrieval algorithm, associated uncertainties and comparisons to Version 2
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 3 (V3) aerosol retrieval algorithm is described, which is based on the Version 2 (V2) algorithm with numerous updates. Comparisons of V3 aerosol retrievals to those of V2 are presented, along with a new approach to estimate uncertainties in many of the retrieved aerosol parameters. Changes in the V3 aerosol retrieval algorithm include (1) a new polarized radiative transfer code (RTC), which replaced the scalar RTC of V2, (2) detailed characterization of gas absorption by adding NO2 and H2O to specify total gas absorption in the atmospheric column, specification of vertical profiles of all the atmospheric species, (3) new bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters for land sites adopted from the MODIS BRDF/Albedo product, (4) a new version of the extraterrestrial solar flux spectrum, and (5) a new temperature correction procedure of both direct Sun and sky radiance measurements. The potential effect of each change in V3 on single scattering albedo (SSA) retrievals was analyzed. The operational almucantar retrievals of V2 versus V3 were compared for four AERONET sites: GSFC, Mezaira, Mongu, and Kanpur. Analysis showed very good agreement in retrieved parameters of the size distributions. Comparisons of SSA retrievals for dust aerosols (Mezaira) showed a good agreement in 440 nm SSA, while for longer wavelengths V3 SSAs are systematically higher than those of V2, with the largest mean difference at 675 nm due to cumulative effects of both extraterrestrial solar flux and BRDF changes. For non-dust aerosols, the largest SSA deviation is at 675 nm due to differences in extraterrestrial solar flux spectrums used in each version. Further, the SSA 675 nm mean differences are very different for weakly (GSFC) and strongly (Mongu) absorbing aerosols, which is explained by the lower sensitivity to a bias in aerosol scattering optical depth by less absorbing aerosols. A new hybrid (HYB) sky radiance measurement scan is introduced and discussed. The HYB combines features of scans in two different planes to maximize the range of scattering angles and achieve scan symmetry, thereby allowing for cloud screening and spatial averaging, which is an advantage over the principal plane scan that lacks robust symmetry. We show that due to an extended range of scattering angles, HYB SSA retrievals for dust aerosols exhibit smaller variability with solar zenith angles (SZAs) than those of almucantar (ALM), which allows extension of HYB SSA retrievals to SZAs less than 50 degrees to as small as 25 degrees. The comparison of SSA retrievals from closely time-matched HYB and ALM scans in the 50 to 75 degrees SZA range showed good agreement with the differences below similar to 0.005. We also present an approach to estimate retrieval uncertainties which utilizes the variability in retrieved parameters generated by perturbing both measurements and auxiliary input parameters as a proxy for retrieval uncertainty. The perturbations in measurements and auxiliary inputs are assumed as estimated biases in aerosol optical depth (AOD), radiometric calibration of sky radiances combined with solar spectral irradiance, and surface reflectance. For each set of Level 2 Sun/sky radiometer observations, 27 inputs corresponding to 27 combinations of biases were produced and separately inverted to generate the following statistics of the inversion results: average, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values.From these statistics, standard deviation (labeled U27) is used as a proxy for estimated uncertainty, and a lookup table (LUT) approach was implemented to reduce the computational time. The U27 climatological LUT was generated from the entire AERONET almucantar (1993-2018) and hybrid (2014-2018) scan databases by binning U27s in AOD (440 nm), Angstrom exponent (AE, 440-870 nm), and SSA (440, 675, 870, 1020 nm). Using this LUT approach, the uncertainty estimates U27 for each individual V3 Level 2 retrieval can be obtained by interpolation using the corresponding measured and inverted combination of AOD, AE, and SSA.

TI  - Prediction of lymph node metastasis by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in T1 breast cancer
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Lymph node metastasis is more likely in early-stage breast cancer with lower tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density. Therefore, we investigated the correlation between TILs and lymph node metastasis in cT1 breast cancer patients undergoing surgery and the usefulness of TILs in predicting sentinel lymph node metastasis (SLNM) in cT1N0M0 breast cancer. Methods We investigated 332 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery as the first-line treatment after preoperative diagnosis of cT1. A positive diagnosis of SLNM as an indication for axillary clearance was defined as macrometastasis in the sentinel lymph node (SLN) (macrometastasis: tumor diameter > 2 mm). Semi-quantitative evaluation of lymphocytes infiltrating the peritumoral stroma as TILs in primary tumor biopsy specimens prior to treatment was conducted. Results For SLN biopsy (SLNB), a median of 2 (range, 1-8) SLNs were pathologically evaluated. Sixty cases (19.4%) of SLNM (macrometastasis: 46, micrometastasis: 16) were observed. Metastasis was significantly greater in breast cancers with tumor diameter > 10 mm than in those with diameter <= 10 mm (p = 0.016). Metastasis was significantly associated with lymphatic invasion (p < 0.001). These two clinicopathological factors correlated with SLNM even in patients diagnosed with cN0 (tumor size; p = 0.017, lymphatic invasion; p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis for SLNM predictors revealed lymphatic invasion (p = 0.008, odds ratio [OR] = 2.522) and TILs (p < 0.001, OR = 0.137) as independent factors. Conclusions Our results suggest a correlation between lymph node metastasis and tumor immune-microenvironment in cT1 breast cancer. TIL density may be a predictor of SLNM in breast cancer without lymph node metastasis on preoperative imaging.

TI  - Contribution of Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images to study salinization effect of the Touggourt agricultural region (Algeria)
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a new spatio-morphological mapping of a region affected by the problem of salinization of its agricultural land. The rise of salt, which occurs naturally by infiltration of water passing through a saline layer through the faults, is accentuated by poor irrigation management, particularly by the use of Mio-Pliocene's water with an excessive salt content and the inadequate drainage system. We use optical remote sensing data that allows us to study a spacious area with high accuracy (up to 10-m resolution) using Sentinel-2 images in combination with in situ data. In addition to the use of heterogeneous data, we also combine several methods (salinity and vegetation index,K-means clustering, and artificial neural networks classification) to achieve more accurate and reliable results by using software specially designed for this type of processing such as SNAP with its two versions (python dependent and stand-alone). We obtain an occupation map with six classes (dry salty soils, fine sand, medium sand, vegetation, agricultural land, and buildings) with a surface area of salt soils reaching 23% of the total surface area against only 14% of vegetation that is still likely to decrease. These methods allowed us not only to delimit the region affected by the excess salt with more or less intensity but also to highlight its impact on the quality of the vegetation.

TI  - The link between police cadets' field training and attitudes toward police work in China: a longitudinal study
T2  - POLICING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICE STRATEGIES & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the effect and duration of supervised field training on police cadets' worldview of police work in China. Design/methodology/approach The four-wave longitudinal data were collected from graduate students who were pursuing their master's degree in a national Chinese police university from 2016 to 2018. Independent variables including demographic characteristics and knowledge along with experience gained from the internship were used to explain police cadets' attitudes toward police work. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression models were used in the current study. Findings Findings derived from multiple regression analyses suggest that police cadets' attitudes toward police work are conducive to the "shock" of the real-world experience after three-month field training. However, the effect of the field training on police cadets' attitudes toward police work is temporary, not enduring. Research limitations/implications The data for this study were collected from one national police university, and the findings reported here may not be generalized. Practical implications Police field training is important for cadets to develop positive view of police work. It provides practical knowledge for police training and socializes cadets before entering into the law enforcement filed, avoiding the financial cost of resignation. However, the influence of field training is temporal. Hence, it is more appropriate for police administrators to arrange police cadets' field training close to their graduation date, the third year of their college education. Originality/value This study can be considered as an extension of relevant research on law-enforcement-related field training reported in the United States. However, it goes beyond the existing literature by using longitudinal data to answer a long-overdue question: Does supervised field training change the worldview of cadets concerning police work?

TI  - Evaluating relationships of standing stock, LAI and NDVI at a subtropical reforestation site in southern Taiwan using field and satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we evaluate the relationships between the standing stock, field-measured LAI, and NDVI from remotely sensed images and in situ measurements at plantation forests in the subtropics-tropics region of southern Taiwan. The purpose is to facilitate assessing the biomass of reforestation sites in large areas applying the possible stock-LAI-NDVI relationships analyzed in this study. 15-16 years old forest in one square kilometer area with 14 tree species was tested at different spatial scales. In addition, we also assess the relationship of plots with pure tree species for the effect mixed tree species. By long-term monitoring, intensive measurement for 5 years and analysis at different spatial scales, the results show the correlation coefficient of stock-LAI is not significant while that of stock-NDVI is 0.5639, 0.7230 and 0.9283 as the spatial scale enlarges. Negative stock-LAI correlations found for three tree species but all the stock-NDVI correlations for six specific tree species are positive. If the multi-regression is applied, the correlation coefficient of stock-LAI-NDVI is higher than that of the stock-LAI and stock-NDVI, which reaches to the 0.6470, 0.7680 and 0.9995 at the plot, block and site level, respectively; the correlation coefficients of six specific tree species are also larger at the plot level.

TI  - The Landmark Series: Neoadjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer generally do not have significant response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In these patients, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) is an alternative for those who may benefit from tumor downsizing prior to surgery. This article reviews clinical trials that have defined the role of NET. Cumulatively, these trials demonstrate that NET is effective in downsizing ER-positive breast tumors. Aromatase inhibitors are preferred in postmenopausal patients. An aromatase inhibitor with ovarian suppression is effective in premenopausal patients. While trials to date have shown the effectiveness of NET to facilitate breast conservation, they have provided little data regarding optimal axillary management.

TI  - Post-east African Orogen dilation and magmatism: development of a conjugate-style of dolerite dike swarm in the northwestern Arabian shield
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Al Madinah area bimodal dike swarms underwent detailed field mapping, measurements of dikes' attitudes, structural analyses, remote sensing data interpretation, and petrology study. The oldest rock unit is a greenish intermediate dioritic unit that varies in its petrologic composition between microdiorite and andesite porphyry which is intruded by alkali granite. The dioritic and alkali granite units have been cut by intermediate to mafic dikes, ranging in texture and composition from micromonzodiorite and micromonzonite to microgabbro, microdolerite, and basalt or basaltic andesite, as revealed by thin-section work. A stereographic projection and rose diagrams of the mafic dikes formed a regional conjugate dike system, following probably a typical andersonian style, consisting of three major sets, namely, the WNW set which trends between N295 and N330, E-W set between N265 and N270, and finally the ENE (N065) set. The WNW set has its own local system, but it is considered as a set in the overall regional conjugate dike system. The WNW and E-W sets are the conjugate pair of the WNW Najd fault system maximum horizontal shearing, where the ENE set reflects the minimum regional horizontal shearing stress of the Najd system. The interpretation of this dike system is a WNW-ESE sinistral faulting and NE-SW dilation that formed Wadi Al-Hamd Ediacaran continental basin, bounded by two Najd faults and Thurwah-Bir Um suture. The study area underwent final thrust faulting that tilted the dikes towards the east. For the consequent magmatisms during the Neoproterozoic period, followed by Cenozoic volcanism, the Al Madinah area is considered a large igneous province.

TI  - Measuring the location and width of the Antarctic grounding zone using CryoSat-2
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the results of mapping the limit of the tidal flexure (point F) and hydrostatic equilibrium (point H) of the grounding zone of Antarctic ice shelves from CryoSat-2 standard and swath elevation data. Overall we were able to map 31 % of the grounding zone of the Antarctic floating ice shelves and outlet glaciers. We obtain near-complete coverage of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. Here we manage to map areas of Support Force Glacier and the Doake Ice Rumples, which have previously only been mapped using breakin-slope methods. Over the Ross Ice Shelf, Dronning Maud Land and the Antarctic Peninsula, we obtained partial coverage, and we could not map a continuous grounding zone for the Amery Ice Shelf and the Amundsen Sea sector. Tidal amplitude and distance south (i.e. across-track spacing) are controlling factors in the quality of the coverage and performance of the approach. The location of the point F agrees well with previous observations that used differential satellite radar interferometry (DInSAR) and ICESat-1, with an average landward bias of 0.1 and 0.6 km and standard deviation of 1.1 and 1.5 km for DInSAR and ICESat measurements, respectively. We also compared the results directly with DInSAR interferograms from the Sentinel-1 satellites, acquired over the Evans Ice Stream and the Carlson Inlet (Ronne Ice Shelf), and found good agreement with the mapped points F and H. We also present the results of the spatial distribution of the grounding zone width (the distance between points F and H) and used a simple elastic beam model, along with ice thickness calculations, to calculate an effective Young modulus of ice of E = 1.4 +/- 0.9 GPa.

TI  - Mapping connectivity and conflict risk to identify safe corridors for the Persian leopard
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Many large carnivores depend on habitat patches outside protected areas, as well as safe corridors between them. However, corridor assessments typically ignore potential conflicts between carnivores and people, which can undermine corridor effectiveness and thus conservation success. Objectives We identified safe dispersal corridors and conflict-prone movement bottlenecks for Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor) between protected areas in the Alborz Mountains, Iran, by mapping habitat, landscape permeability, and conflict risk. We then identified priority areas for conservation interventions according to the intensities of different threats. Methods We mapped land cover using Landsat satellite images, gathered data on leopard and prey distributions and livestock depredation events via interview surveys in 69 cells of 6 x 6 km each. We then used occupancy modeling to identify habitat patches, used circuit theory modeling to analyze landscape permeability, and assessed human-leopard conflict risk using generalized linear models. Results Leopard habitat use increased with prey availability and decreased with elevation. Prey distribution, in turn, was mostly negatively influenced by agricultural lands and distance from protected areas. Conflict risk (i.e., probability of leopard depredation on livestock) was high in landscapes where agriculture was widespread and historical forest loss high. Not accounting for conflicts overestimated connectivity among habitat patches substantially. Conclusions Human-carnivore conflicts are an important constraint to connectivity and should be considered in corridor assessments. Our study shows how habitat analysis, connectivity assessment, and conflict risk mapping can be combined to guide conservation planning for identifying habitat networks and safe corridors for carnivores in human-dominated landscapes.

T2  - VETERINARY SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To determine the effect of surgery on lymphoscintigraphy drainage patterns from the canine brachium. Study design Experimental study. Animals Eight healthy research beagles. Methods A predefined area of skin measuring 2 x 1.5 cm in dimension was designated on either the right or left brachium. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was performed with technetium sulfur colloid injected into the subcutaneous tissues around the predefined anatomic location in a four-quadrant technique. Dogs underwent surgery for excision of the predefined area of skin, subcutis, and fascia of the lateral head of the triceps muscle with 1-cm margins. Eighteen days after surgery, lymphoscintigraphy was again performed with technetium sulfur colloid injected into the subcutaneous tissues around the surgical scar in a four-quadrant technique. Results Sentinel lymph nodes were identified in eight of eight dogs preoperatively and in eight of eight dogs postoperatively. Agreement between the results of the preoperative and postoperative lymphoscintigraphy studies was identified as complete in four of eight dogs and partial in four of eight dogs. Sentinel lymph node identification occurred immediately in three of eight dogs preoperatively and in eight of eight dogs postoperatively. Conclusion Sentinel lymph node identification occurred faster postoperatively. Agreement or partial agreement between the results of the preoperative and postoperative lymphoscintigraphy studies was observed in eight of eight dogs. Clinical significance Surgery appears to have an effect on lymphoscintigraphy drainage patterns. Additional studies are required to compare preoperative and postoperative sentinel lymph node mapping patterns in tumor-bearing dogs. However, this study provides preliminary information regarding the effect of surgery on sentinel lymph node identification.

TI  - Synergic Use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Images for Soil Moisture Retrieval in Vegetation Covered Agricultural Areas of Jingxian County of Heibei Province
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation has significant effect on the retrieval of surface soil moisture by microwave remote sensing. A related study was carried out in Jingxian County of Hebei Province. The quantitative inversion research on the surface soil moisture in vegetation covered agricultural areas was based on the combination method of the modified water cloud model and the Oh model using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data. The results show that the combination method had good inversion accuracy in the VV polarization mode, with R-2 of 0. 653 0, RMSE of 0. 040 1 cm(3) . cm(-3) , MAE of 0. 032 7 cm(3) . cm(-3). Compared with the VH polarization mode, the VV polarization mode had better ability for the detection of the change of surface soil water content. The proposed method can obtain the data of the surface soil moisture with high spatial resolution and high accuracy in the vegetation covered areas.

TI  - Analysis of the interannual variation characteristics of the northernmost drift position of the green tide in the Yellow Sea
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The green tide in the Yellow Sea is the world's largest macroalgal bloom. The maximum area affected by green tide can reach tens of thousands of square kilometers. Previous studies have shown that green tide drifts northward during the outbreak, yet the location of its northernmost drift and the characteristics of interannual variations have not been explored in detail. In this paper, we use the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data, GaoFen-1 (GF-1) satellite data, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial data, and field trips for extraction and monitoring of green tide and then analyze the emergence, development, and dissipation of the green tide in Rongcheng coastal waters and the change of the northernmost drift position and its related factors from the year of 2013 to 2018. The results show that green tide have drifted to the Rongcheng coastal area over the years and the northernmost drift position can reach 37.662 degrees N in 2014. Interannual difference of the northernmost position of the drift of the green tide is obvious, it is mainly affected by the wind, and there is no certain connection with the maximum coverage area, the coverage area when reaching the northernmost position, and the existence days of the green tide. These results can help to understand the drift range and dissipation process of green tide in the Yellow Sea.

TI  - Landscape changes in avulsive river systems: Case study of Taquari River on Brazilian Pantanal wetlands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal is an important active sedimentary basin in central South America where highly diverse flora and fauna are sustained by seasonal floods. Intense land use in the catchment areas enhanced sediment load and destabilized avulsive river systems in the plains. A well-known avulsion in the Taquari River during the 1980-90s, called "Ze da Costa", has shifted the river mouth and drastically changed the nearby landscapes, making them difficult to map because of the hard access and the large variations in spectral and spatial attributes of raster data like Landsat images. Therefore, we developed a useful method to map and explore landscape changes in "Ze da Costa" avulsion that combines geotagged field pictures, randomly selected high-resolution orbital truths, normalized difference vegetation index, digital elevation models, linear spectral mixture models and Landsat historical imagery in pixel-based and object-oriented supervised classifications. We found that bands in green, red, and near-infrared spectra provide better mapping results with object-oriented algorithms for deriving and studying temporal dry/wet ratio dynamics. The temporal analyses of the dry/wet ratio showed that avulsions in the Taquari River have the potential to change permanently the "Ze da Costa" area into a dry landscape, making it susceptible for land use (deforestation and fire), except areas seasonally inundated by the floods of the Paraguay River. Overall, our method might be also useful for long-term studies of land use and climate change in avulsive rivers in wetlands around the world. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
