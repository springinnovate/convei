AB  - Accurate estimation of vegetation functioning, i.e. canopy photosynthesis [gross primary production (GPP)] and evapotranspiration (ET) in a drought episode is of great importance. We investigated the capability of Landsat (TM5 and ETM7) optical/thermal observations for estimating daily GPP and ET of annual C3 grasses at a Fluxnet site (US-Var) during the 2004 prolonged drought episode in California. Vegetation properties information [i.e., Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab), leaf water content (C-w), leaf dry matter content (C-dm), the leaf inclination distribution function (LIDF) and the senescent material content (C-s)] were obtained by inversion of the optical radiative transfer routines (RTMo) of the Soil-Canopy-Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model, against the optical bands of Landsat. The values of the maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax), the Ball-Berry stomatal conductance parameter (m) and soil resistances (r(ss) and r(bs)) were obtained by inversion of the energy balance and thermal radiative transfer routines (RTMt) of SCOPE, against the thermal band of Landsat. Finally, the retrieved properties were linearly interpolated over time and used together with half-hourly meteorological variables in the SCOPE model to estimate time series of daily GPP and ET. The results demonstrate that estimates of daily GPP and ET during a drought episode can be improved considerably by exploiting the information contained in both the optical and thermal domain together.

TI  - Inorganic Nanoparticles for Cancer Therapy: A Transition from Lab to Clinic
T2  - CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) including those derived from metals (e.g., gold, silver), semiconductors (e.g., quantum dots), carbon dots, carbon nanotubes, or oxides (e.g., iron oxide), have been deeply investigated recently for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in oncology. Compared to organic nanomaterials, inorganic NPs have several advantages and unique characteristics for better imaging and drug delivery. Still, only a limited number of inorganic NPs are translated into clinical practice.Method: In this review, we discuss the progression of inorganic NPs for cancer therapy and imaging, focusing our attention on opportunities, limitations and challenges for the main constituting nanomaterials, including metallic and magnetic NPs. In particular, the pre-clinical and clinical trials from the bench toward the clinic are here investigated.Results: Over the last few decades, the development of wide range of NPs with the ability to tune size, composition and functionality, has provided an excellent resource for nanomedicine. Inorganic NPs provide a great opportunity as drug carriers, due to the easy modification of targeting molecules, the control of drug release by different stimuli, and the effective delivery to target sites, thus resulting in having an improved therapeutic efficacy and in reducing side effects. Inorganic NPs are investigated in preclinical and clinical studies for the detection, diagnosis and treatment of many diseases. The stability of inorganic NPs offers a potential advantage over the traditional delivery methods. Inorganic NPs could enhance and improve current imaging and diagnostic techniques, such as MRI or PET. Even though, they have not yet been approved for drug delivery applications, their ability to respond to external stimuli is now widely investigated in clinic.Conclusion: The successful translation of inorganic NPs to the clinic requires the development of a simple, safe, cost-effective, ecofriendly mode of synthesis, and a better understanding of the safety mechanisms, biodistribution and the pharmacokinetics of NPs. However, more attention should be given to concerns on long-term toxicity, carcinogenesis, immunogenicity, inflammation and tissue damage. Although, some inorganic NPs, which were apparently promising in the preclinical phase, were found not to be successful when translated to the clinic, several encouraging NPs are currently being developed for treatment and cancer care and for a wide variety of other diseases.

AB  - This research focused on the following objectives: (1) using satellite data to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of anthropogenic oil spills from Oil Rocks Settlement, Chilov and Pirallahi Islands (2) stochastic modelling of the oil spill risk pose to water quality and shoreline ecosystems, and (3) validating model predictions using satellite images. 165 satellite images acquired between 1996 and 2015 were used for the detection of oil spills using object-based classification and visual interpretation. Anthropogenic hotspots were observed at Oil Rocks Settlement, Chilov and Pirallhi Islands, three oldest oil production sites with estimated oil spilling up to 1264 m3 per day. They had different degrees of temporal repetition of oil spills. The largest area (5639 km2) experienced 1-10 detected oil spills, while 993 km2 experienced 11-20 oil spills, 775 km2 experienced 21-50 oil spills, 208 km2 experienced 51100 oil spills, and 36 km2 experienced 101-150 oil spills. The majority (83% or 6157 km2) of sea surface area within the combined boundary of detected oil spills (7422 km2) had a 50% or greater chance of oil spill contamination, indicating good agreement between predictions and data. Additionally, exponential regression analysis revealed positive correlation between pixel values for contamination probability and calculated oil spill frequency. Approximately 6% (44 km of 751 km) of Azerbaijan's shoreline had a 50% or greater probability of contamination from oil spills over the period of 2006-2009 with land use classes sensitive to pollution. This research demonstrates how remote sensing data can be used to identify oil pollution hotspots quantitatively assess the risk to shoreline areas with high environmental value.

AB  - Oil and gas development in the Caspian region is associated with pollution risks. This research aimed to better understand those risks by (1) using satellite data to characterise the spatial and temporal distribution of anthropogenic and naturally occurring oil slicks in the Azerbaijani portion of the Caspian Sea (2) performing stochastic modelling of the risk that the oil spills pose to water quality and shoreline ecosystems and (3) validating model predictions using satellite images. Over 411 satellite images acquired by SENTINEL-1, LANDSAT-8, RADARSAT, ENVISAT and ERS sensors between 1996 and 2017 were used for the semi-automatic detection and discrimination of oil spills and natural seepage slicks using object-based classification and visual interpretation. Anthropogenic oil pollution, natural seepage slicks and 'hotspots' or areas frequently covered by oil slicks were identified. Anthropogenic hotspots were observed at Oil Rocks Settlement, Chilov and Pirallahi Islands, three of the area's oldest oil platforms, with oil spill rates of up to 1264 m 3 per day. The contamination probability of more than 50% was primarily located in the shoreline range of 464-508 km with the existence of high rank environmental and social sensitivities. The highest maximum accumulated emulsion mass (tonnes) was also observed in the shoreline range of 464-508 km with high contamination probability > 50% and with the existence of high rank environmental and social sensitivities. This research demonstrates how remote sensing data can be used to identify oil pollution hotspots and to quantitatively assess the risk to shoreline areas with high environmental value.

AB  - The authors' understanding ofneuro-programming is the result of the impact on the human brain of information and communication technology (including educational one), through which in the human brain the programs of manifestation in the ontogenesis of internal creative potentials are written. This article summarizes the history of the formation of key neuro-programming technologies of the human brain as well as proves that the changes in the society's worldview are caused by the possibilities and quality of neuro-programming technologies that society uses. Having influence over worldview stereotypes and behaviour set by the society, neutv-progromming technologies essentially ensure the national security of any state and the peaceful coexistence of states in the regions and on the planet as a whole. Using historical and philosophical methods, methods of conceptualization, systematization, modeling, etc., the authors have come to the conclusion that the modern world lies in a confrontation of security strategies, in which neuro-programming technologies play a key role.

TI  - SENSING SDR-BASED GNSS JAMMERS
T2  - 12TH ANNUAL BASKA GNSS CONFERENCE

CP  - 12th Annual Baska GNSS Conference
CL  - Baska, CROATIA
AB  - The increased use of satellite-navigation-based systems (tracking, geofencing, fleet optimization, landmark identification, location-based gaming, etc.) has led to the development of devices that are capable of interfering with them or even fraudulently impersonating them. The talk is about GNSS (almost exclusively GPS) jammers and spoofing devices, respectively. The former are of particular concern because they are mass-produced and have a relatively low price, although they are illegal in most countries. GPS jammers typically work by producing a strong noise signal (virtually all produce chirp signals around the main L1 band) that drowns out the genuine satellite signal. Although the jamming signal needs to be strong close to the device being attacked, the signal decreases rapidly with an increasing distance from the jammer. This presents a challenge when it comes to detecting such a signal. In this study, a solution based on software-defined radio (SDR) is presented. SDR is essentially a device that acquires a raw electromagnetic signal in the frequency band of interest, converts it into digital form and then sends it to a computer. All the post-processing is then done using the software. Such an approach has many advantages because it provides a detailed insight into the jamming signal. Since a large amount of data acquired by such a system cannot all be saved on a mass storage device, it is essential to spot the presence of a disturbing signal in order to save just the relevant data that is suitable for subsequent analysis. In the first part, the various algorithms used to discriminate the signal will be presented. In the second part, a proposal for classifying the jammers will be described. Although virtually all the jammers emit chirp signals centered on the GPS L1 frequency (1575.42 MHz), their stability is typically very poor. For this reason, interesting patterns in their power spectral distribution can be observed on different time scales, providing a means for their classification. The data was acquired in a controlled environment, as well as at the roadside.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Tomsk, RUSSIA
AB  - In December 2017 and January 2018, the total ozone content was much lower than normal over Tomsk and northern territory of Russia, based on Aura OMI data. The lidar measurements of vertical ozone distribution revealed that ozone maximum shifted toward lower altitudes in January, and in December it was also smaller in magnitude. Moreover, lidar measurements showed the presence of aerosol layers over Tomsk, which, together with lowered temperatures in the stratosphere according to Aura MLS data, might signify the presence of polar stratospheric clouds (PSC). Thus, in December 2017 and January 2018 in the atmosphere over Tomsk the temperature was much lower than PSC formation threshold, the altitude and magnitude of ozone maximum were much lower than normal, and the observation site had been under the influence of Arctic air masses with decreased ozone and increased water vapor contents.

TI  - Tracking forest attributes across Canada between 2001 and 2011 using a <i>k</i> nearest neighbors mapping approach applied to MODIS imagery
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping Canada's forests is a significant challenge given their extent and the interprovincial differences in forest inventories. We created new sets of nationally consistent forest attribute maps for the years 2001 and 2011 by building upon previously published work with the objective to determine if sequential maps of forest attributes could be used to quantify changes over time. We first refined our previously published methodology of using the k nearest neighbors (kNN) prediction method and MODIS spectral reflectance data as predictive variables. The maps were generated using an improved reference dataset and a new analytical kNN workflow. We then evaluated 2001 to 2011 changes in two key attributes, aboveground biomass and percent tree cover, on pixels identified from published sources as having undergone fire, harvest, or postdisturbance regrowth during that period. For all three change types, average changes in both aboveground biomass and percent tree cover between 2001 and 2011 matched expectations relative to the dynamics of Canadian forests. Our results support the use of sequential national maps of forest attributes for evaluating regionally aggregated disturbance-related changes in forest properties. The new forest attribute maps are available from Beaudoin et al. (2017; doi:10.23687/ec9e2659-1c29-4ddb-87a2-6aced147a990) at http://ouvert.canada.ca/data/fr/dataset/ec9e2659-1c29-4ddb-87a2-6aced147a990.

AB  - Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is looking at restoring the missing high-resolution information from a single low-resolution image in order to increase the apparent spatial resolution by a factor of two or more. In recent years, convolution neural networks have been applied with great success to the problem of improving spatial resolution from a single image. With the advent of low-resolution (10 m) optical sensors such as Sentinel-2, it is interesting to explore the possibility of improving image resolution with Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The purpose of this article is to investigate the potential performances of recent DL super-resolution techniques. The techniques explored here include not only techniques for enhancing high-frequency content but also so-called image-to-image translation techniques based on Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GAN). From our preliminary results, we show that GANs have the ability to restore complex textural information.

TI  - Domestic violence counselors and secondary traumatic stress (STS): A brief qualitative report and strategies for support
T2  - SOCIAL WORK IN MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mental health counselors who provide trauma counseling to domestic violence survivors are exposed to catastrophic stories of danger, physical and emotional vulnerability. As counselors try to assess and treatment plan for and with survivors, they are often deeply affected. For some practitioners, bearing witness to these frightening narratives results in a sympathetic form of trauma known as secondary traumatic stress. This article reports on the findings from a convenience sampling of domestic violence shelter counselors (N = 11). Patterns of emotional reactions emerge as a result of two focus groups. Four themes emerged: 1) hypervigilance, 2) impact on personal life, 3) a shift in worldview and 4) methods of coping.

TI  - Assessing the drivers of land use change in the Rumpi hills forest protected area, Cameroon
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas serve two objectives, biodiversity conservation and securing of ecosystem services. But the recent expansion of human activities around Cameroon's Rumpi Hills Forest Reserve in this Era of Sustainable Development Goals is a call for concern. This study assesses land use and land cover change around the reserve and their potential impact on its sustainability. A total of 250 household surveys were conducted across 13 villages in four selected sites around the reserve in addition to 11 focus group discussions. Landsat 7 ETM (2000) and Landsat 8 OLI (2014) images and topographic maps were utilized to quantify land use and land cover change.During the 14-year period, dense forest dropped to 90.2% while settlements increased from 744.6 to 2148.8 hectares in 2014. Also, farmlands increased by 18.25% representing a change from 9400.4 to 11117.16 hectares. Over 98% and 85% of the respondents are engaged in the cultivation of food and cash crops and are dependent on the forests for timber and non-timber forests products. Land and tree-based interventions that improve soil fertility should be promoted among smallholder farmers to ensure the sustainability of protected areas in Cameroon.

TI  - Simulation and analysis of synoptic scale dust storms over the Arabian Peninsula
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms are among the most severe environmental problems in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. The predictability of seven dust events, viz. Dl: April 2-4, 2014; D2: February 23-24, 2015; D3: April 1-3, 2015; D4: March 26-28, 2016; D5: August 3-5, 2016; D6: March 13-14, 2017 and D7:March 19-21, 2017, are investigated over the Arabian Peninsula using a regionally adapted chemistry transport model CHIMERE coupled with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. The hourly forecast products of particulate matter concentrations (PM10) and aerosol optical depths (AOD) are compared against both satellite-based (MSG/SEVRI RGB dust, MODIS Deep Blue Aerosol Optical Depth: DB-AOD, Ozone Monitoring Instrument observed UV Aerosol Absorption Index OMI-AI) and ground-based (AERONET AOD) remote sensing products. The spatial pattern and the time series of the simulations show good agreement with the observations in terms of the dust intensity as well as the spatiotemporal distribution. The causative mechanisms of these dust events are identified by the concurrent analyses of the meteorological data. From these seven storms, five are associated with synoptic scale meteorological processes, such as prefrontal storms (D1 and D7), postfrontal storms of short (D2), and long (D3) duration types, and a summer shamal storm (D6). However, the storms D4 and D6 are partly associated with mesoscale convective type dust episodes known as haboobs. The socio-economic impacts of the dust events have been assessed by estimating the horizontal visibility, air quality index (AQI), and the dust deposition flux (DDF) from the forecasted dust concentrations. During the extreme dust events, the horizontal visibility drops to near zero values co-occurred withhazardous levels of AQI and extremely high dust deposition flux (250 mu g cm(-2) day(-1)).

AB  - The current study is concerned with Rusafa side of Baghdad city, which extends on 362 square kilometres and is inhabited by 3738371 people. It suffers from population growth, which led to decline in municipal services and rising of land surface temperature (LST) during the summer season. The current study aims to assess the spatial and temporal variation of LST using different dated satellite images of Landsat 4, 7 and 8 at path 168 and raw 037 during July 16, 1989, April 25, 2000, April 26, 2006, and May 31, 2016. Eight analysis models which were built using ERDAS 2014 software are used to calculate the LST parameters; while the land use/land cover (LULC) types are classified using ENVI v.5.3 software. The maximum surface temperature recorded at barren lands are between 26 and 41 degrees C, while at vegetation cover ranging from 25 to 34 degrees C and an inverse correlation are recorded between LST and NDVI ranging from-0.5 to -0.81. The built-up area was increased by 23%, whereas open spaces and vegetation cover are decreased by 16% and 6% respectively all that consequently will make the environment of the study area prone to be warmer.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Cropping Practices: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - For agronomic, environmental, and economic reasons, the need for spatialized information about agricultural practices is expected to rapidly increase. In this context, we reviewed the literature on remote sensing for mapping cropping practices. The reviewed studies were grouped into three categories of practices: crop succession (crop rotation and fallowing), cropping pattern (single tree crop planting pattern, sequential cropping, and intercropping/agroforestry), and cropping techniques (irrigation, soil tillage, harvest and post-harvest practices, crop varieties, and agro-ecological infrastructures). We observed that the majority of the studies were exploratory investigations, tested on a local scale with a high dependence on ground data, and used only one type of remote sensing sensor. Furthermore, to be correctly implemented, most of the methods relied heavily on local knowledge on the management practices, the environment, and the biological material. These limitations point to future research directions, such as the use of land stratification, multi-sensor data combination, and expert knowledge-driven methods. Finally, the new spatial technologies, and particularly the Sentinel constellation, are expected to improve the monitoring of cropping practices in the challenging context of food security and better management of agro-environmental issues.

AB  - Orenburg Russian dialects are of particular interest in terms of studying the linguistic worldview primarily because they were formed as a result of versatile active contacts between North Russian and South Russian dialects surrounded by Turkic and Finno-Ugrian languages, as well as competition between Cossack and << peasant's >> dialects. The consideration of secondary dialects' lexical system on the territory of the Orenburg region and their peculiarities reveals the presence of a significant number of Turkic borrowings related to the natural features of the area, being new for the Russian migrants. Mastering of the corresponding fragments of other linguistic worldviews that do not have corresponding analogues affects certain aspects of household and economic activity, especially of steppe cattle breeding, among which camel husbandry and breeding of downy goats are marked out. In this, migrants' own linguistic worldview was not replaced and substituted for another one; on the contrary, under the influence of other linguistic worldviews, it was adjusted and expanded in accordance with the peculiarities of its own, in which its basic foundations were not touched, but even strengthened due to the acceptance of other realities in their development by neighboring ethnoses.

AB  - Earth Observation (EO) through remote sensing satellites gathers reliable information about the environment. The evolution of satellite instrumentation leads to considerable satellite data volumes which require on one hand, mathematically and statistically based algorithms to extract valuable information and, on the other hand, increased computational power for processing. The paper proposes image processing algorithms for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images together with application-specific hardware architectures for satellite imagery. It is well known that performing feature extraction in image analysis involves complex search algorithms implementation. A novel approach based on content-addressable memories (CAM) for search algorithms optimization is proposed. Results in terms of computational time are presented for the proposed approach and compared with classical image processing search algorithms implementations.

AB  - Worldwide, about 2.1 PgC are released every year from biomass burning. Due to its importance for climate modelling, several products were developed to map burned areas (BA) at global levels. Most of these products are based on medium or low-resolution optical sensors which are rather insensitive to small size fires. Moreover, frequent cloud cover and smog may hinder BA detection using optical sensors. To mitigate such shortcomings, BA may be derived from high resolution radar backscatter time-series. This study analyses the results of a locally adaptive BA detection algorithm based on data acquired by the ESA's C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 A and B satellites. Sentinel-1 time series were analysed to understand the backscatter coefficient variation over burned and unburned areas. In addition, the analysis was extended to areas where the detection algorithm was affected by commission and omission errors. The study was carried out at 17 sites globally distributed. The analysis revealed shortcomings of the proposed algorithm particularly over areas where fire does not significantly decrease the cross-polarized backscatter. Over such areas, the backscatter change in the co-polarized channel could provide additional information that may overcome the lack of pre to post fire dynamic range of the VH polarization. In fact, for more than 50% of the study sites the change in VV polarization was peaked over undetected burned areas (omission errors). Furthermore, the VV polarization may help reducing commission errors as similar backscatter changes over burned and unburned areas was observed over less tiles (47%) when compared to the VH polarization (70%).

CP  - Conference on Active and Passive Microwave Remote Sensing for Environmental Monitoring II
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Fire is considered an essential climate variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Remote sensing is often used to detect the burned areas and subsequently estimate CO2 emissions from wildfires. Most burned area mapping approaches are based on optical images. However, cloud cover independent radar datasets are increasingly employed for burned area detection. This study presents results related to a burned area detection algorithm based on temporal series of backscatter images. The algorithm was developed in the frame of the ESA's Fire_cci project. During the development, it was observed that large temporal differences exist between the fire date and the date when significant changes of the C-band backscatter coefficient occurred. In this contribution we analysed this temporal decorrelation. The aim was to quantify it and try to understand the reasons behind it and thus improve the C-band SAR based mapping algorithm.

TI  - Sentinel-2 cropland mapping using pixel-based and object-based time-weighted dynamic time warping analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient methodologies for mapping croplands are an essential condition for the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices and for monitoring crops periodically. The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as those provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for generating accurate datasets on available crop types, in ready-to-use vector data format. Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping, based on high resolution remote sensing data, are mainly focused on pixel-based analysis of time series data. This paper evaluates how a time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method that uses Sentinel-2 time series performs when applied to pixel-based and object-based classifications of various crop types in three different study areas (in Romania, Italy and the USA). The classification outputs were compared to those produced by Random Forest (RF) for both pixel- and object-based image analysis units. The sensitivity of these two methods to the training samples was also evaluated. Object-based TWDTW outperformed pixel-based TWDTW in all three study areas, with overall accuracies ranging between 78.05% and 96.19%; it also proved to be more efficient in terms of computational time. TWDTW achieved comparable classification results to RF in Romania and Italy, but RF achieved better results in the USA, where the classified crops present high intra-class spectral variability. Additionally, TWDTW proved to be less sensitive in relation to the training samples. This is an important asset in areas where inputs for training samples are limited.

AB  - Capturing spatial and temporal environmental dynamics in heterogeneous tropical landscapes through remote sensing data has become an important challenge in environmental monitoring studies due to cloud contamination. In Brazilian Amazon, there is a great need of data able to provide information for a wide range of decision makers. Alongside this, a wide variety of free remotely sensed data products have been made available. The combination of information from more than one sensor could maximise the number of cloud-free images as well as their temporal and spatial resolution. Based on this framework, this study investigates the potential and quality of a set of fused images obtained from the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager Instrument (MSI) and Landsat OLI satellites sensors over the region of Brazilian Amazon, comparing their performance according to different land cover/land use areas. In this context, the objectives of this study were: (1) assess qualitatively the two main group of image fusion approaches, namely component substitution (CS) and multiresolution analysis (MRA), as well as their suitability for the fusion of Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI image pair from selected areas in Brazilian Amazon; (2) compare three different image fusion methods for measuring efficacy and performance to determine the best spatio-temporal information: the Intensity Hue Saturation (IHS) method, the Brovey transformation (BT) and the Gram-Schmidt (GS) method; (3) assess quantitatively the methods employed through a set of fusion quality metrics in order to identify the more accurate results based on different reference images.

TI  - Comparative study of three satellite image time-series decomposition methods for vegetation change detection
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite image time-series (SITS) methods have contributed notably to detection of global change over the last decades, for instance by tracking vegetation changes. Compared with multi-temporal change detection methods, temporally highly resolved SITS methods provide more information in a single analysis, for instance on the type and consistency of change. In particular, SITS decomposition methods show a great potential in extracting various components from non-stationary time series, which allows for an improved interpretation of the temporal variability. Even though many case studies have applied SITS decomposition methods, a systematic comparison of common algorithms is still missing.In this study, the seasonal trend loess (STL), breaks for additive season and trend (BFAST) and multi-resolution analysis-wavelet transform (MRA-WT) were explored in order to evaluate their performance in modelling, monitoring and detecting land-cover changes with pronounced seasonal variations from simulated normal difference vegetation index time series. The selected methods have all proven their ability to characterize the non-stationary vegetation dynamics along with different physical processes driving the vegetation dynamics. Our results indicated that BFAST is the most accurate method for the examined simulated dataset in terms of RMSE, whereas MRA-WT showed a great potential for the extraction of multi-level vegetation dynamics. Considering the computational efficiency, both STL and MRA-WT outperformed BFAST.

AB  - Groundwater withdrawals by farmers, in Morocco, are very numerous and informal. Therefore, the need for information on the location of irrigated areas is becoming increasingly important. Our main objective, in this study, is to evaluate the use of high-resolution Landsat 8 (L8) time series images and Random forest (RF) method to produce a land cover map with a sufficient precision to monitor the extension of irrigated areas. In the first part of this study, four parameters were evaluated: Number of trees, min split samples, max features and max depth. The results proves that the last parameter is the most important and has more impact on the oob score, which can reach 91%. The second part of this study was devoted to reduce furthermore the number of features taken as input in the classification process. This was done through feature reduction then selection. The computational time was highly reduced and the best level of classification accuracy was reached by using only Landsat 8 (L8) time series images, statistics on the temporal spectral indices (NDVI, MNDWI) and Range texture.

AB  - The management of "DAYAS" is a major issue in the preservation and maintain of biodiversity and environmental balance, especially in a context where this fragile ecosystems face many degradation factors.The extraction of Dayas is a key component in the management process of this type of wetlands, and has been the subject of many researches related to remote sensing.The methods and instrumentation for optical remote sensing are used to improve the mapping of Dayas, based on the radiometric characteristics of local hydrosystems. The present paper studies the inputs of different methods for the delimitation and extraction of Dayas in the realm of Benslimane city, using Sentinel A-2 imagery for the mapping.The methodology for the application of the pixel-based and the object-oriented approaches requires many steps, starting from an image pre-processing with Sentinel-2 calibration, the calculation of NDWI index, to proceed to the extraction of Dayas from the very high resolution image segmentation, then the application of the object-oriented classification to validate the results.The cartographic results demonstrate the input of the applied methodology in the Dayas extraction in different situations and timing (winter/summer), and allow to measure the cartographic accuracy for each approach, finding 65% of accuracy for the pixel-based approach with Kappa index =0.40 versus 75% of accuracy for the object-oriented approach with Kappa index = 0.72.The results achieved inform and orient about optimisation measures and regulations of the Kappa index to improve the Dayas extraction and mapping.

AB  - In this paper a new approach based on the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 products to map urban change detection and to observe suburb's development is presented. The algorithm developed can process data in a fast, automatic and accurate way. To reach this goal, the processing chain uses an iterative multitemporal approach based, for each iteration, on three procedures. The first and second ones are based on Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) applied to SAR and optical images, respectively, while the third processing is an optical multiband filter, implementing the spectral difference computation. The three outputs of each iteration are fused together by means of a weighted average formulation. The algorithm may deal with multitemporal acquisitions to improve the overall accuracy in the detection of urban changes by the integration of the outputs at different time intervals.

AB  - Current and forthcoming sensor technologies and space missions are providing remote sensing scientists and practitioners with an increasing wealth and variety of data modalities. They encompass multisensor, multiresolution, multiscale, multitemporal, multipolarization, and multifrequency imagery. While they represent remarkable opportunities for the applications, they pose important challenges to the development of mathematical methods aimed at fusing the information conveyed by the input multisource data. In this framework, the present chapter continues the discussion of remote sensing data fusion, which was opened in the previous chapter. Here, the focus is on data fusion for image classification purposes. Both methodological issues of feature extraction and supervised classification are addressed. On both respects, the focus is on hierarchical image models rooted in graph theory. First, multilevel feature extraction is addressed through the latest advances in Mathematical Morphology and attribute profile theory with respect to component trees and trees of shapes. Then, joint supervised classification of multisensor, multiscale, multiresolution, and multitemporal imagery is formulated through hierarchical Markov random fields on quad-trees. Examples of experimental results with data from current VHR optical and SAR missions are shown and analysed.

TI  - Evaluation of rainfall forecasts combining GNSS precipitable water vapor with ground and remote sensing meteorological variables in a neural network approach

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXIII

AB  - In this study, an experiment aimed to integrate Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) atmospheric data with meteorological data into a neural network system is performed. Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) estimates derived from GNSS are combined with surface pressure, surface temperature and relative humidity obtained continuously from ground based meteorological stations. The work aims to develop a methodology to forecast short-term intense rainfall. Hence, all the data is sampled at one hour interval. A continuous time series of 3 years of GNSS data from one station in Lisbon, Portugal, is processed. Meteorological data from a nearby meteorological station are collected. Remote sensing data of cloud top from SEVIRI is used, providing collocated data also on an hourly basis. A 3 year time series of hourly accumulated precipitation data are also available for evaluation of the neural network results. In previous studies, it was found that time varying PWV is correlated with rainfall, with a strong increase of PWV peaking just before intense rainfall, and with a strong decrease afterwards. However, a significant amount of false positives was found, meaning that the evolution of PWV does not contain enough information to infer future rain. In this work a multilayer fitting network is used to process the GNSS and meteorological data inputs in order to estimate the target outputs, given by the hourly precipitation. It is found that the combination of GNSS data and meteorological variables processed by neural network improves the detection of heavy rainfall events and reduces the number of false positives.

CL  - Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS
AB  - Thanks to their high spectral resolution, hyperspectral remote sensing data provide a wide range of information for urban sin-face characterization. In this work, a new method is proposed to unmix urban hyperspectral remote sensing data by exploiting some known urban endmember spectra. The proposed approach is designed for the linear-quadratic mixing model involved in the considered images. It uses a multiplicative linear-quadratic nonnegative matrix factorization (LQNMF) and can be considered as a partial/informed LQNMF approach. Experiments are carried out on realistic synthetic data to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Obtained results prove that the designed method yields better performance than methods from the literature.

T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Localization and histopathological examination of sentinel lymph node is a standard of melanoma treatment. The first stage of identification of the SLN is the preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. The aim of this study was to assess and compare diagnostic value of planar lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT in sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure performed in patients with cutaneous trunk melanoma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2015 and 2016, patients with trunk melanoma (N = 255, F/M 95/160), aged from 17 to 88 after an excisional biopsy, with primary tumor >= pT1b (AJCC 2009, median Breslow thickness 2.0 +/- 3.13) were included in the study. In all the patients PL was followed by SPECT/CT 1-3 hours after injection of Tc-99m-colloid particles, and SLNB was performed the next day.RESULTS: SPECT-CT revealed 78 (18.6%) SLN more than PL, and in 40 patients showed additional lymph drainage regions leading to surgical adjustments. In 18 patients (7.1%) SPECT-CT revealed SLN not visible in the PL (false-negative PL) and in 22 patients (8.6%), foci of uptake interpreted in PL as hot SLNs were found to be non-nodal sites of uptake when assessed on SPECT/CT (false positive PL). SPECT-CT vs. PL mismatch was observed in 31 patients (12.2%) and was the most common in patients with primary lesions located in the anterior inferior medial region (75%).CONCLUSIONS: Results of the presented study indicates the high diagnostic value of SPECT-CT in assessment of SLNs and proved that SPECT-CT increases the sensitivity and accuracy of SLN identification as compared to PL even in very experienced hands.

T2  - RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of minimum flows is increasingly important due to the relationship with ecosystem sustainability, the economy and its role as a sentinel of climate change. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the theoretical treatment of minimum extremes and, specifically, minimum flows. The method has two approaches: i) conventional; ii) asymptotic. In conventional analysis, the Weibull (W2) and Lognormal distributions of two parameters (LN2) were adjusted to the series of annual minimum flows and minimum averages of 7-day flows. In the asymptotic analysis approach two parent distributions, the distributions of all average daily flows, with power behavior for minimum flows, are investigated: i) Gamma; ii) LN2. The theory studied in this paper is applied to 11 gauged stations in the Iguacu river basin with 48-year data series. It was concluded that the LN2 distribution presents the best fit according to the chi(2) test. It was found that the Gamma distribution, with respect to the minimums, tends to a power function, and consequently the W2 distribution. The parameters k, b and mu(X), of the normalized annual minimum flow series are well-fitted to the LN2 distribution. According to both approaches, LN2 can be recommended for studies of minimum flows in the Iguacu river basin.

AB  - Uncertainty of roughness parameters has effect on soil moisture retrievals with backscatter models from Synthetic Aperture Radar observations. The uncertainty of soil moisture retrievals is important information for the usability of these estimates. In this paper we introduce a methodology to estimate the uncertainty of effective roughness parameters in the Integral Equation Method surface backscatter model, using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. Using Sentinel-1 imagery we demonstrate the methodology for a selected field, showing the posterior uncertainty distributions of the roughness parameters, and the effect on the backscatter model simulations and soil moisture inversions. The estimated total uncertainty of the soil moisture retrievals with the optimum parameter set is 0.043 m(3)/m(3), which is slightly higher than the root mean square error of 0.040 m(3)/m(3) of the retrievals compared to in situ soil moisture measurements.

AB  - Automatically recognizing cancers from multi-gigapixel whole slide histopathology images is one of the challenges facing machine and deep learning based solutions for digital pathology. Currently, most automatic systems for histopathology are not scalable to large images and hence require a patch-based representation; a sub-optimal solution as it results in important additional computational costs but more importantly in the loss of contextual information. We present a novel attention-based model for predicting cancer from histopathology whole slide images. The proposed model is capable of attending to the most discriminative regions of an image by adaptively selecting a limited sequence of locations and only processing the selected areas of tissues. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed model on the slide-based prediction of macro and micro metastases in sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer patients. We achieve competitive results with state-of-the-art convolutional networks while automatically identifying discriminative areas of tissues.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important instrument for oceanographic observations, providing detailed information of oceans' surface and artificial floating structures. Due to advances in SAR technology and deployment of new SAR satellites, an increasing amount of data is available, and the development of efficient classification systems based on deep learning is possible. A deep neural network has improved the state of the art in classification tasks of optical images, but its use in SAR classification problems has been less exploited. In this paper, a full workflow for SAR maritime targets detection and classification on TerraSAR-X high-resolution image is presented, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) recently proposed in the literature are cross evaluated on a common data set composed of five maritime classes, namely, cargo, tanker, windmill, platform, and harbor structure. Based on experiments and tests, a multiple input resolution CNN model is proposed and its performance is evaluated. Our results indicate that CNNs are efficient models to perform maritime target classification in SAR images, and the combination of different input resolutions in the CNN model improves its ability to derive features, increasing the overall classification score.

AB  - Phytoplankton are photosynthetic organisms that live in the upper part of the water's surface. A rapid growth in a short time cause the appearance of blooms which can long-term impact marine ecosystem and fisheries. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations, the proxy pigment of phytoplankton biomass, is measured with conventional in-situ analysis methods and retrieved from satellite observations. Currently, remotely sensed ocean color data constitute a rich and important spatio-temporal database that has been exploited in many scientific studies and has been shown to be relevant in phytoplankton dynamic metrics. Here in this study, we analyze 11 years of ocean color observations, MERIS (2003-2012) and MODIS (2012-2013) archives, over Algerian coasts in order to compute the chl-a concentrations corresponding to the start and end of bloom event. The determination is based on one of the most used definition of bloom in pelagic ocean, when chl-a concentrations rise above and fall below the full time series median for each pixel plus 5%. Satellite data were preprocessed considering flags to eliminate contaminated pixels, land, cloud and open water pixels. Spatial distribution mapping of results was done showing that the highest magnitudes are concentrated near the coasts. For statistical comparison purpose, the shelf waters were divided into six regions, limited from north by the 1000 m bathymetric curve and from south by Algerian coastline. The east and west limits for each region are chosen considering the marine meteorological regions. This study highlights for the first time the spatial distribution, at high resolution (250 m), of bloom initiation magnitudes along Algerian shelf waters, taking into account the influence of important wadis (small Mediterranean river) flowing there, the marine meteorology and north Algeria pluviometry. Statistics, particularly means, based on the proposed regions, seems to be relevant because they are consistent with the dominant regional pluviometry. In fact, the precipitation causes a runoff of the lands and this flow enters the sea loaded with nutrients. The obtained values can be used to determine the bloom start timing and others phenological parameters.

It consists of a set of complex systems that collect data from satellites and in-situ sensors, process this data and provide users with reliable and up-to-date information on a range of environmental and security issues. The data collected by Copernicus is made available freely following an open access policy. Information extracted from Copernicus data is disseminated to users through the Copernicus services which address six thematic areas: land, marine, atmosphere, climate, emergency and security. We present a demo from the Horizon 2020 Copernicus App Lab project which takes big data from the Copernicus land service, makes it available on the Web as linked geospatial data and interlinks it with other useful public data to aid the development of applications by developers that might not be Earth Observation experts. Our demo targets a scenario where we want to study the "greenness" of Paris.

The RF model is run with and without C-band SAR backscatter to understand the importance of the inclusion of SAR data for mapping of soil moisture at field scale. The inclusion of SAR data in the RF resulted in a modest improvement however the geophysical parameters (e.g. soil types and terrain properties) were of greater importance.

AB  - Urban structure types (USTs) are a concept in urban ecology to divide cities into units of homogenous environmental conditions. They provide a useful means to conceive efficient strategies for sustainable urban development. Cutting edge remote sensing data and methods allow for the automation of the UST classification process. This paper aims at demonstrating the robustness of a recently developed approach for area-wide mapping of 13 USTs. To this end, the experimental setup of this work includes three major cities in Germany, different sets of high-resolution multi-source data as well as statistical measures to enable the assessment of methodological accuracy and transferability. The results of this study emphasize the suitability of the presented approach with regard to classification accuracy, workflow automation, and operational readiness for future UST mapping and monitoring tasks.

AB  - The proper management of nitrogen (N) is a pre-requisite for sustainable fertilization in modern agriculture. Methods for N -retrieval from Earth Observation (E. O.) data have been mainly based on empirical algorithms. In the present study, two methods (physically based / hybrid) for the assessment of crop nitrogen content (Narea) and concentration (Nmass) were tested. Data from a hyperspectral field campaign in the framework of the future satellite mission Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) were exploited using a recalibrated PROSPECT model coupled with the canopy reflectance model 4SAIL. The physically based algorithm achieved relative errors (rRMSE) of 72% for Narea with R (2) = 0.92. The hybrid approach obtained higher accuracies with rRMSE lower than 16% for the retrieval of Nmass. Uncertainties of the predictor variables have to be taken into account. Both algorithms represent interesting techniques for global agricultural monitoring from hyperspectral satellite data but further analysis is required.

AB  - This work reports on a new MODIS-derived plant primary productivity workflow that takes advantage of the availability of 1-km daily weather datasets (Daymet) for North America. Daymet products account for topographic variability and heterogeneous distribution of weather stations. Previous progress in MODIS-based primary productivity computation, represented by quality analysis (use of QA/QC fields), spike removal and gap filling are also considered during processing. Resulting productivity estimates showed good agreement with flux tower data for multiple vegetation cover types. Products derived from this methodology should improve estimates of primary productivity over complex terrain occurring in North America.

TI  - First Joint Observations of Radio Aurora by the VHF and HF Radars of the ISTP SB RAS
T2  - RADIOPHYSICS AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Two modern radars for diagnosis of the ionosphere by the radio-wave backscattering method, namely, the Irkutsk incoherent scatter radar at VHF (IISR, 154-162 MHz) and the Ekaterinburg coherent radar at HF (EKB, 8-20 MHz) are operated at the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (ISTP SB RAS). The paper analyzes the results of joint observations of strong scattering (radio aurora) on June 8, 2015. To determine the geographical position of the radio aurora, we developed original methods that take into account both the features of the radio-wave propagation and the features of the radar antenna systems. It is shown that there are areas where the spatial position of the HF and VHF radio aurora can coincide. This permits using the radars as a single complex for diagnosis of the characteristics of small-scale high-latitude irregularities in the ionospheric E and F layers. A comparative analysis of the characteristics and temporal dynamics of the radio-aurora region in the HF and VHF ranges is performed. Using the DMSP satellite data, it has been shown that the radio aurora dynamics during this experiment with the EKB radar can be related with the spatial dynamics of the localized area with high electric field, which moves from high to equatorial latitudes. It is found that due to the broader field of view, radio aurora at the HF radar was stably observed 6-12 min earlier than at the VHF radar. This permits using the EKB radar data for prediction of the radio-aurora detection by the IISR radar.

TI  - TREE AGE AS ADJUSTMENT FACTOR TO NDVI
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - ABSTRACT This study aimed to increase satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) sensitivity to biophysical parameters changes with aid of a forest age-based adjustment factor. This factor is defined as a ratio between stand age and age of rotation, which value multiplied by Landsat-5/TM-derived NDVI generated the so-called adjusted index NDVI_a. Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) was also calculated. The relationship between these vegetation indices (VI) with Eucalyptus and Pinus stands wood volume was investigated. The adjustment factor caused an increase in NDVI dynamic range values, since older stands tended to be assigned with highest NDVI values, while younger ones tended to be forced to assume lower NDVI values. As a result, direct and significant relationship between NDVI_a and wood volume could be maintained for wider ranges of wood volume. However, it was observed that NDVI_a was only statistically superior to NDVI and SAVI when a detailed age dataset is available. It is conclude that, the stand age has potential to improve NDVI sensitivity to biophysical parameters allowing that quantitative estimates could be made since young to adult stands.

AB  - All melanoma suspected patients must be confirmed histologically and resected. Sentinel node biopsy must be done when tumor is over 1 mm or if less with high-risk factors. Adjuvant therapy with interferon could be offered for patients with high-risk melanoma and in selected cases radiotherapy can be added. Metastatic melanoma treatment is guided by mutational BRAF status. BRAF wild type patients must receive anti-PD1 containing therapy and BRAF mutated patients BRAF/MEK inhibitors or anti-PD1 containing therapy. Up to 10 years follow up is reasonable for melanoma patients with dermatologic examinations and physical exams.

TI  - A CIRCULAR APPROACH TO MULTI-CLASS CHANGE DETECTION IN MULTITEMPORAL SENTINEL-1 SAR IMAGE TIME SERIES

AB  - This paper presents a multitemporal technique for multi-class Change Detection (CD) between pairs of images of a satellite image time series. Changes between different pair of images within a time series must be consistent with each other since images acquired over the same scene are causally related with one another. The temporal consistency of the pixel status can be used to formulate a principle that constrains the CD results within the series to be mutually consistent. This principle coincides with the conservative property of the change variable and it allows the unsupervised validation of changes detected between arbitrary image pairs. Thus, all images in the series, rather than a single couple, are used in the pair-wise CD. The proposed technique was applied to a dataset of dual-polarized terrain-corrected SAR images acquired by Sentinel-1. Experimental results show the validity of the proposed multitemporal approach in improving the CD results.

AB  - The history of research on the biography and artistry of Hryhorija Skoworoda has been in existence for more than two centuries. But the rich spiritual legacy of this author has not been thoroughly explored by our contemporaries. The most difficult problem is the study of the mystical worldview of Skoworoda, which is reflected in his religious-philosophical works.

AB  - RELEASE 2.6.1, August 13, 2018 New satellites Support Cartosat-1 and Perusat-1 RPC cameras. New tools Added convert_pinhole_model, to convert between various existing such models. Added camera_footprint as a helpful utility to show where images will project on to the ground. Documented and improved the ipfind and ipmatch tools. ipfind is used to detect interest points in input images, either to generate .vwip files for other tools or to experiment with different IP finding settings. ipmatch matches the IPs contained in .vwip files to create .match files. New camera models Added simple atmospheric refraction correction to the DG and SPOT5 camera models. This can be manually disabled using the "--disable-correct-atmospheric-refraction" option. Added support for pinhole camera models where the lens distortion is given by an RPC model (rational polynomial coefficients), of degrees 4, 5, and 6. Such a model may be more expressive than existing ones, and its coefficients can now be optimized using bundle adjustment. An initial model can be created with convert_pinhole_model. stereo_corr Added new options for post-SGM subpixel stereo. Previously only a parabola method was used. Added option to perform cross-correlation checks on multiple resolution levels while using SGM/MGM. Added option --corr-search-limit to constrain the automatically computed correlation search range. Added --corr-memory-limit-mb option to limit the memory usage of the SGM/MGM algorithms. Improved search range estimation in nadir epipolar alignment cases. Added --elevation-limit option to help constrain this search range. Added hybrid SGM/MGM stereo option. Improvements to SGM search range estimation. Added --min-num-ip option. bundle_adjust Added the ability to optimize pinhole camera intrinsic parameters, with and without having a LIDAR or DEM ground truth to be used as reference (the latter is recommended though). The tool is a lot more sensitive now to --camera-weight, existing results may change a lot. Added the parameters --rotation-weight and --translation-weight to penalize large rotation and translation changes. Added the option --fixed-camera-indices to keep some cameras fixed while optimizing others. Can read the adjustments from a previous invocation of this program via --input-adjustments-prefix. Can read each of pc_align&#39;s output transforms and apply it to the input cameras via --initial-transform, to be able to bring the cameras in the same coordinate system as the aligned terrain (the initial transform can have a rotation, translation, and scale). If --input-adjustments-prefix is specified as well, the input adjustments are read first, and the pc_align transform is applied on top. Renamed --local-pinhole to --create-pinhole-cameras. Added the parameter --nodata-value to ignore pixels at and below a threshold. Added the ability to transfer interest points manually picked in mapprojected images to the the original unprojected images via --mapprojected-data. Added the flag --use-lon-lat-height-gcp-error. Then, if using GCP, the three standard deviations are interpretted as applying not to x, y, z but to latitude, longitude, and height above datum (in this order). Hence, if the latitude and longitude are known accurately, while the height less so, the third standard deviation can be set to something much larger. Added the ability to do multiple passes of bundle adjustment, removing outliers at each pass based on reprojection error and disparity (difference of pixel value between images). This works for any number of cameras. Match files are updated with outliers removed. Controlled via --num-passes, --remove-outliers-params and --remove-outliers-by-disparity-params. Added the option --save-cnet-as-csv, to save the control network containing all interest points in the format used by ground control points, so it can be inspected. If --datum is specified, bundle_adjust will save to disk the reprojection errors before and after optimization. stereo_gui Can view SPOT5 .BIL files. pc_align Add the ability to help the tool with an initial translation specified as a North-East-Down vector, to be used to correct known gross offsets before proceeding with alignment. The option is --initial-ned-translation. When pc_align is initialized via --initial-transform or --initial-ned-translation, the translation vector is now computed starting from the source points before any of these initial transforms are applied, rather than after. The end point of this vector is still the source points after alignment to the reference. This is consistent with the alignment transform output by the tool, which also is from the source points before any initial alignment and to the reference points. The translation vector was expressed incorrectly in the North-East-Down coordinate system, that is now fixed. dem_mosaic If the -o option value is specified as filename.tif, all mosaic will be written to this exact file, rather than creating tiles. point2dem Added the ability to apply a filter to the cloud points in each circular neighborhood before gridding. In addition to the current weighted average option, it supports min, max, mean, median, stddev, count, nmad, and percentile filters. The --search-radius-factor parameter can control the neighborhood size. Sped up hole-filling in ortho image generation. If this creates more holes than before, it is suggested to relax all outlier filtering, including via --remove-outliers-params, median filtering, and erosion. Added the option --orthoimage-hole-fill-extra-len to make hole-filling more aggressive by first extrapolating the cloud. datum_convert Rewrote the tool to depend on the Proj.4 HTDPGrids grid shift system. This fixed some situations where the tool was not working such as WGS84/NAD83 conversions and also added support for datum realizations (versions). Vertical datum conversion is only supported in simple cases like D_MARS to MOLA. Even with HTDPGrids, datum support with the Proj.4 library is poor and will hopefully be improved with future releases. Until then try to get external verification of results obtained with the datum_convert tool. wv_correct Supports WV2 TDI = 32 in reverse scan direction. Misc We now compile against USGS ISIS version 3.5.2. The tools mapproject, dem_mosaic, dg_mosaic, and wv_correct support the --ot option, to round the output pixels to several types of integer, reducing storage, but perhaps decreasing accuracy. The tools mapproject and image_calc support the --mo option to add metadata to the geoheader in the format &#39;VAR1=VAL1 VAR2=VAL2&#39;, etc. Handle properly in bundle_adjust, orbitviz, and stereo with mapprojected images the case when, for RPC cameras, these coefficients are stored in _RPC.TXT files. Support for web-based PROJ.4 strings, e.g., point2dem --t_srs http://spatialreference.org/ref/iau2000/49900/ Added --max-output-size option to point2dem to prevent against creation of too large DEMs. Added image download option in hiedr2mosaic.py. Bugfix in cam2map4stereo.py when the longitude crosses 180 degrees. Added support for running sparse_disp with your own Python installation. Bugfix for image cropping with epipolar aligned images. The sfs tool supports the integrability constraint weight from Horn 1990. The software works with both Python 2 and 3.

TI  - Impact of sentinel lymph node biopsy in newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer patients with suspicious node: a comparative accuracy survey of fine-needle aspiration biopsy versus core-needle biopsy
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparing diagnostic accuracy study between ultrasonography (US) guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and core-needle biopsy (CNB) of the Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer patients. We selected 289 newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer patients from June 2015 to July 2017. Ultrasound (US) guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNA) and core-needle biopsy (CNB) was performed to identify patients with suspicious sentinel lymph node (SLN). Patients with a cortical thickness > 2 mm or atypical morphological characteristics were recommended FNA and CNB. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was applied to patients with biopsy-proven metastasis, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was applied to FNA or CNB negative patients. ALND was also performed when SNB is positive. Out of 289 patients, only 131 patients met final study criteria. Lymph node status was evaluated by FNA, CNB, SLND, and ALND. Among 131 patients, 45 were deemed positive for metastasis and 86 were determined to be negative with CNB, whereas 38 were deemed positive for metastasis and 93 were determined to be negative by using FNAB. CNB was used to correctly identify seven axillae as positive for metastasis that were deemed negative by using FNAB. There were no positive FNAB results in axillae that were negative for metastasis with CNB. All patients underwent SLNB and those with biopsy-proved axillary metastases were assigned directly to ALND as the primary staging procedure. The final histopathologic assessment indicated that 50 (38.2%) of the 131 axillae studied had axillary LN metastases. Axillary US-guided CNB was used to correctly identify 45 (90.0%) of the 50 LN-positive axillae, whereas axillary US-guided FNAB was used to correctly identify 38 (76.0%, P < 0. 001). There were no false-positive results. CNB netted 5 false-negative results, and FNAB resulted in 12. There was significantly different accuracy between different diagnostic tools. In our study, we demonstrated that CNB is a more reliable approach than FNA for the preoperative diagnosis of SLN metastasis.

AB  - This paper presents the lessons learned from the ongoing investigation at Cal Poly Pomona on the effectiveness of UAV-based remote sensing technology in detecting plant stresses due to water and nutrients. UAVs equipped with multispectral/hyperspectral sensors and RGB cameras were flown over lettuce and citrus plants at Cal Poly Pomona's Spadra farm. The spectral sensor data were used in the determination of various vegetation indices that provide information on the water and nitrogen stresses of the plants. Proximal sensors that were used for the verification of remote sensing data included water potential meter, chlorophyll meter, and handheld spectroradiometer. The paper shows the relationship between the remote sensing and proximal sensor data. The paper also discusses the flight test procedures, data collection methods, and lessons learned so far.

AB  - This paper presents the ground-truthing of remote sensing data of citrus plants collected from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The main advantage of the UAV-based remote sensing is the reduced cost and immediate availability of high resolution data. This helps detect crop stresses throughout the crop season. Near infrared (NIR) images obtained using remote sensing techniques help determine the crop performances and stresses of a large area in a short amount of time for precision agriculture, which aims to optimize the amount of water, fertilizers, and pesticides using site-specific management of crops. However, to be useful for the real-world applications, the accuracy of remote sensing data must be validated using the proven ground-based methods. UAVs equipped with multispectral sensors were flown over the citrus orchard at Cal Poly Pomona's Spadra Farm. The multispectral/hyperspectral images are used in the determination of vegetation indices that provide information on the health of the plant. Handheld spectroradiometer, water potential meter, and chlorophyll meter were used to collect ground-truth data. Correlations between the vegetation indices calculated using airborne data and proximal sensor data are shown.

TI  - Estimation of Minimum and Maximum Air Temperature Using MODIS Remote Sensing Imagery and Geographical Information System (GIS)

CP  - 5th International Conference on Water, Environment, Energy and Society (WEES)

AB  - Air temperature is a useful environmental variable in a wide range of applications in areas of ecology, hydrology and atmospheric sciences. Estimating air temperature (T-a) is very important in monitoring the environment, estimating precipitation, climatic prediction, determining evapotranspiration, predicting crop yield and climatic changes, etc. Furthermore, it is the most important meteorological and climatological variable, along with radiation, in plant development, determining its spatial distribution, and conditioning agricultural soil suitability. In agro-meteorological, hydrological, hydro-meteorological studies, one of the main issues is the lack of representative temperature data. Density of the meteorological stations network is generally sparse, and installation and running cost of additional meteorological stations are very high. As a result, obtaining high spatial resolution maximum temperature (T-max) and minimum temperature (T-min) map from meteorological stations data is not possible. Remote sensing data provides synoptic spatial coverage compared to discrete spatial distribution of meteorological stations, thus encouraging researchers to make use of satellite data to fill in the gaps inherent in meteorological station data. Satellite remote sensing image is fundamentally designed to offer spatially distributed information over earth observation. Therefore, this study is carried out with the objectives to select appropriate MODIS data for simulation of temperature and with application of selected imaginary to simulate temperature in the Limkheda watershed located in the semi-arid middle region of Gujarat. Temperature data during the month of October 2010, at two sites of the Limkheda watershed are applied to explore the capabilities of MODIS satellite imagery to simulate the minimum and maximum temperature in the Limkheda watershed. It is found in this study that bands namely Day_view_angle and Emis_32 of MODIS imagery simulate minimum and maximum temperature satisfactorily. It is found in this study that Day_view_angle simulate minimum temperature very well, whereas Emis_32 band simulate both the maximum and minimum temperature very well. From this study, it is recommended that Emis_32 band would be a suitable choice to calculate temperature.

T2  - GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGIES IN LAND RESOURCES MAPPING, MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In the study, the importance of pedogeomorphic analysis in land resource inventories at various scales, mutual contributions of pedology and geomorphology, classification of geoforms, application of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) in geomorphology mapping were discussed. This article describes how pedogeomorphic analysis was used in detailed soil surveys in basaltic uplands of Darwha plateau in Yavatmal district, Maharashtra, in developing soil-landscape models that control and explain the shrink-swell soil pattern within a land region having similar agricultural management requirements for cotton-based cropping systems. Soil-landscape relationships in Darwha plateau were studied in detailed along the transects comprised of lithic/typic Ustorthents on plateau tops to lithic/typic/ vertic Haplustepts on pediments and leptic to Typic Haplusterts on pediplains. The key pedogenic processes recognized in shrink-swells were identified as development of vertic features and CaCO3 accumulation in deeper layers. Both field and laboratory analyses confirmed that the soils within landscapes form a continuum but that recognition of the soil groupings was more practical and feasible in mapping soils in the region. A combination of IRS-P6 and Cartosat-I fused data, field examination of soils and their characterization was used to recognize landscape-related soil groupings to develop farm scale maps that can support multiple land use applications and decision-making.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Relationship Linking Land Use/Land Cover with Groundwater Level
T2  - GROUNDWATER, ICWEES-2016
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 5th International Conference on Water, Environment, Energy and Society (WEES)
CL  - AISECT Univ, Bhopal, INDIA
AB  - Land use and land cover changes have been undergoing at a rapid rate universally. Anthropogenic activities where human intervention is involved is been considered as a major driver for land use changes. This type of advancement in land activity has caused depletion of natural resources more so groundwater table. There is a great need for assessment of groundwater profile at local level. Groundwater is maximally harnessed for many water use purposes in Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka. This study aims to analyze and quantify the effect of land use/land cover (LU/LC) transformations along a time scale with the fluctuating groundwater levels. Groundwater level information of the year 2003 and 2013 from observation wells and satellite imagery from Landsat with ETM 7 and OLI sensors were used. Kriging, a geostatistical method of interpolation, used well data as points taken at different locations (29 wells) all over the district and created a continuous surface using interpolation with the estimate of error. LULC map of 2003 and 2013 was derived from classification of TM images using supervised, parametric maximum likelihood classifier. Area is broadly categorized into four classes, namely vegetation, urban areas, water, and other category. Accuracy assessment of this classification yielded kappa statistics of greater than 0.8 for both the images and overall accuracy greater than 90%. Further, relationship between LULC and groundwater level is inferred with the help of 1 by 1 km grid. Rainfall and stream network were used in ascertaining the sensitive areas in terms of groundwater that hold a hydrogeological importance. It was inferred from the study that the groundwater depletion to the extent of 2 m has been evident in the urban areas with an increase in built-up greater than 25 acres per 250 acres. These fluctuations are evident in the northwest and south regions of the district compared to the other areas. Moreover, these hydrogeologically sensitive areas for recharge need protection from further development activities.

TI  - An optimization approach to estimate and calibrate column water vapour for hyperspectral airborne data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The article describes a novel approach to estimate and calibrate column water vapour (CWV), a key parameter for atmospheric correction of remote-sensing data. CWV is spatially and temporally variable, and image-based methods are used for its inference. This inference, however, is affected by methodological and numeric limitations, which likely propagate to reflectance estimates. In this article, a method is proposed to estimate CWV iteratively from target surface reflectances. The method is free from assumptions for at sensor radiance-based CWV estimation methods. We consider two cases: (a) CWV is incorrectly estimated in a processing chain and (b) CWV is not estimated in a processing chain. To solve (a) we use the incorrect estimations as initial values to the proposed method during calibration. In (b), CWV is estimated without initial information. Next, we combined the two scenarios, resulting in a generic method to calibrate and estimate CWV. We utilized the hyperspectral mapper (HyMap) and airborne prism experiment (APEX) instruments for the synthetic and real data experiments, respectively. Noise levels were added to the synthetic data to simulate real imaging conditions. The real data used in this research are cloud-free scenes acquired from the airborne campaigns. For performance assessment, we compared the proposed method with two state-of-the-art methods. Our method performed better as it minimizes the absolute error close to zero, only within 8-10 iterations. It thus suits existing operational chains where the number of iterations is considerable. Finally, the method is simple to implement and can be extended to address other atmospheric trace gases.

AB  - Conventional methods of monitoring wetlands and detecting changes over time can be time-consuming and costly. Inaccessibility and remoteness of many wetlands is also a limiting factor. Hence, there is a growing recognition of remote sensing techniques as a viable and cost-effective alternative to field-based ecosystem monitoring. Wetlands encompass a diverse array of habitats, for example, fens, bogs, marshes, and swamps. In this study, we concentrate on a natural wetland-Clara Bog, Co. Offaly, a raised bog situated in the Irish midlands. The aim of the study is to identify and monitor the environmental conditions of the bog using remote sensing techniques. Environmental conditions in this study refer to the vegetation composition of the bog and whether it is in an intact (peat-forming) or degraded state. It can be described using vegetation, the presence of water (soil moisture) and topography. Vegetation indices (VIs) derived from satellite data have been widely used to assess variations in properties of vegetation. This study uses mid-resolution data from Sentinel-2 MSI, Landsat 8 OLI for VI analysis. An initial study to delineate the boundary of the bog using the combination of edge detection and segmentation techniques namely, entropy filtering, canny edge detection, and graph-cut segmentation is performed. Once the bog boundary is defined, spectra of the delineated area are studied. VIs like NDVI, ARVI, SAVI, NDWI, derived using Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI are analysed. A digital elevation model (DEM) was also used for better classification. All of these characteristics (features) serve as a basis for classifying the bog into broad vegetation communities (termed "ecotopes") that indicate the quality of raised bog habitat. This analysis is validated using field derived ecotopes. The results show that, by using spectral information and vegetation index clustering, an additional linkage can be established between spectral RS signatures and wetland ecotopes. Hence, the benefit of the study is in understanding ecosystem (bog) environmental conditions and in defining appropriate metrics by which changes in the conditions can be monitored.

AB  - The CERES measured shortwave and longwave fluxes rely on the cloud properties derived using the coincident observations from the accompanying high-resolution MODIS and VIIRS imagers. The calibration consistency is required between MODIS and VIIRS radiances to ensure that the CERES provided cloud property retrievals are temporally consistent. This paper presents multiple approaches of cross-calibrating the spectrally comparable reflective solar bands (RSB) of Aqua-MODIS and NPPVIIRS, and estimates the radiometric biases for individual band pair. The inter-comparison is performed between the Aqua-MODIS collection 6.1 level 1B and NPP-VIIRS Land PEATE V1 datasets. Radiometric biases up to 3% were estimated between the MODIS and VIIRS radiances for visible bands.

TI  - Evidence for Auroral Emissions From Callisto's Footprint in HST UV Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Auroral emissions are expected from the footprint of Callisto in Jupiter's upper atmosphere owing to the known interaction of its atmosphere with Jupiter's magnetosphere, and from the observed auroral emissions from the footprints of the other three Galilean satellites. The mapping of Callisto along modeled magnetic field lines at Jupiter, however, places the expected footprint at the same latitude as the main auroral emissions, making it difficult to detect. We analyzed ultraviolet images of Jupiter taken using the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys instrument during a large observing campaign in 2007. Using a coaddition method similar to one used for Enceladus, we have identified a strong candidate for the footprint of Callisto on 24 May 2007. We tested this finding by applying the same coaddition technique to a nearly identical auroral configuration on 30 May 2007 when Callisto was behind Jupiter, not visible from Earth (central meridian longitude=22 degrees; sub-Callisto system III longitude=327 degrees). By comparing the two coadded images, we can clearly see the presence of a strongly subcorotating spot close to the expected Callisto footprint location on 24 May and its absence on 30 May. On 24 May Callisto was located in the current sheet. We also found a probable candidate on 26 May 2007 during which time Callisto was positioned below the current sheet. The measured location and intensity of the auroral emission provide important information about the interaction of Callisto with Jupiter's magnetic field, the corotating plasma, and the neutral and ionized state of the thin atmosphere of Callisto.

AB  - In this manuscript, we demonstrate the spatial and temporal variability of AOD over the Nepalese cryosphere may be reconstructed through empirical relationships developed from numerical weather model analysis fields and geographic variables. Our manuscript is novel, providing: * a capability to extrapolate AOD over the cryospheric portion of Nepalese Himalayas * an understanding of the relationships between ECMWF Reanalysis with observed AOD * and a cross-validation of an empirical model using MODIS derived AOD and AERONET data. The empirical model that we present in this study, could potentially be applied to other mountains regions. We believe that the findings presented in our manuscript provide a novel approach to address the challenge of paucity of observations for aerosols in the cryospheric portion in Himalaya region.

TI  - Wildfire Dynamics and Occasional Precipitation during Active Fire Season in Tropical Lowland of Nepal
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Occasional precipitation plays a vital role in reducing the effect of wildfire. This precipitation is especially important for countries like Nepal, where wildfires are a common seasonal event. Approximately 0.1 million hectare of forest area is affected annually due to wildfires in active fire season. The study on the relation of these forms of occasional precipitation with wildfire incidence is still lacking. This research was objectively carried out to examine the correlation of occasional precipitation with wildfire incidence and burnt area. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spector-Radiometer (MODIS) satellite images and precipitation records for 15 years gathered from Department of Hydrology and Metrology were used as input data for this study. The images were analyzed by using ArcGIS function while the precipitation records were analyzed by using Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) program. The linear regression model was applied to find correlation of occasional precipitation with wildfire incidence and burnt area. Analysis revealed decreasing trend of precipitation in study area. We found significant correlation (p<0.05) of precipitation with wildfire incidence and burnt area. Findings will be useful for policy makers, implementers and researchers to manage wildfire in sustainable basis.

TI  - Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast: Experience at a tertiary care centre of Northern India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast (breast-ACC) is a rare tumor with a favorable prognosis, despite its triple-negative status and special type of basal-like tumor for which scant population-based descriptive data exist. We sought to provide new population-based information on breast-ACC in India. Due to the paucity of the number of cases, the natural history of the disease is not fully understood. This study was undertaken to examine the clinico-pathological characteristics of the disease and to evaluate the outcome of surgical intervention in a tertiary referral care centre.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all patients diagnosed and treated for ACC Breast in our hospital over the past 10 years was carried out (2005-2015). A database of the characteristics of these patients was developed. In all, 14 patients were identified. The investigations performed included routine blood investigations, chest X-ray, bone scan and either an ultrasound or a CT scan.RESULTS: During the time period of 10 years, of 2347 with breast malignancy admitted to our department, only 14 were diagnosed as having ACC (3.15%). All patients were women (100%). The patients had a median age of 60.7 years (range 37-81). The most common symptom was lump in the breast. Two patients (14.2%) presented with nipple and skin retraction and two patients (14.2%) were asymptomatic with the diagnosis made by an incidental finding on routine examination. The CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the typical features of carcinoma breast. All the 14 patients were taken up for surgery. Nine patients underwent Modified radical mastectomy and five patients underwent Breast conservation surgery. Axillary lymph node dissection was carried out in seven patients and sentinel lymph node biopsy in the remaining. Tumor cells had a characteristic histologic pattern of ACC of the breast. Perineural invasion was present in six cases.DISCUSSION: ACC of the breast is a very rare malignancy, accounting for less than 0.1% of all breast neoplasms. It affects the left and right breasts equally and tumors arise irrespective of the breast quadrants. However, in about 50 percent of patients, lesions are found in subareolar region. Pain or tenderness described in the minority of cases has not been correlated with histologically-confirmed perineural invasion. ACC is categorized as a basal-like subtype of breast carcinoma. Most cases are macroscopically well-circumscribed. Occasionally, pink, tan, or gray microcysts are evident. A tumor typically consists of a dual-cell population of luminal and myoepithelial-basal cells which may be arranged in one or more of three architectural patterns: tubular-trabecular, cribriform, and solid-basaloid. There is no consensus on the optimal management for patients with ACC of the breast. Based on its indolent clinical course and favorable outcome, ACC of the breast is generally cured by breast-conserving surgery, such as wide excision or quadrantectomy with or without radiotherapy.CONCLUSION: Breast-ACC among women is characterized by ER-negative/PR-negative expression, rare regional lymph node involvement, a favorable prognosis with excellent survival, and absence of associated cancers. These findings reinforce the importance of tailored treatments for breast-ACC and the apparent heterogeneity of basal-like breast cancers.

TI  - Gender and nature in the matrilineal society of Meghalaya, India: Searching for ecofeminist perspectives
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecofeminist perspective of the matrilineal society of Meghalaya, India, is intriguing in that it has descent through mother, is matrilocal and daughters inherit parental property, but the different genders possibly do not agree about the relationship between women and nature. Ecofeminism has not yet been studied in a matrilineal society. The purpose of the study was to investigate qualitatively the students' ecofeminist perspectives among the Khasi, Jaintia, and Garo tribes of Meghalaya, through students who were studying in North Eastern Hill University, Shillong, India. The sample consisted of 33 students purposefully selected to complete an open questionnaire and unstructured interviews. The responses showed that the women of this matrilineal society seem to be more ecofeminist compared with the men. However only a minority of both male and female expressed an ecofeminist worldview with respect to nature and development indicating that this concept is at early stage of development.

TI  - Remote-sensing-based study of impact of a rock avalanche on North Terong Glacier in Karakorum Himalaya
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we report the results of a study on occurrence of a mass-movement event classified as 'rock avalanche' over the North Terong glacier (a tributary of the Siachen Glacier in the Nubra Valley), using multi-date remote-sensing data of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) and its effects on glacier-surface velocity. Normalized cross-correlation image matching method for displacement measurements at sub-pixel level using Computer Imaging Analysis Software (CIAS), an add-on module of Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) software, was used to map changes in the position of debris-deposits of the rock avalanche and assess variations in glacier-surface velocities. Well-defined debris margins gave positions of debris on different dates. Study indicated that this rock avalanche must have occurred between 21 April 2000 and 8 May 2000 (possibly on 3 or 4 May). It induced a kinematic wave or a 'mini-surge' in the glacier with its surface velocity showing almost twofold increase in post-event period.

AB  - GF-2 remote sensing products have been widely used in many fields for its high-quality information, which provides technical support for the the macroeconomic decisions. Atmospheric correction is the necessary part in the data preprocessing of the quantitative high resolution remote sensing, which can eliminate the signal interference in the radiation path caused by atmospheric scattering and absorption, and reducting apparent reflectance into real reflectance of the surface targets.Aiming at the problem that current research lack of atmospheric date which are synchronization and region matching of the surface observation image, this research utilize the MODIS Level 1B synchronous data to simulate synchronized atmospheric condition, and write programs to implementation process of aerosol retrieval and atmospheric correction, then generate a lookup table of the remote sensing image based on the radioactive transfer model of 6S (second simulation of a satellite signal in the solar spectrum) to correct the atmospheric effect of multi-spectral image from GF-2 satellite PMS-1 payload.According to the correction results, this paper analyzes the pixel histogram of the reflectance spectrum of the 4 spectral bands of PMS-1, and evaluates the correction results of different spectral bands. Then conducted a comparison experiment on the same GF-2 image based on the QUAC. According to the different targets respectively statistics the average value of NDVI, implement a comparative study of NDVI from two different results. The degree of influence was discussed by whether to adopt synchronous atmospheric date. The study shows that the result of the synchronous atmospheric parameters have significantly improved the quantitative application of the GF-2 remote sensing data.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this 257-participant study (76% female; mean age: 44.84), we examined two ideas that are widespread among burnout researchers: (a) the idea that burnout is primarily related to occupational-level factors; and (b) the idea that burnout should be considered a sentinel indicator in research on negative occupational outcomes. We investigated the links between burnout and a series of generic and work-related variables, namely, depressive symptoms, neuroticism, extraversion, effort-reward imbalance in the job [ERI], social support at work (SSW), and turnover intention. Burnout was assessed with the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure, depressive symptoms with the PHQ-9, neuroticism and extraversion with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory, ERI with the 10-item version of the Effort-Reward Imbalance Questionnaire, SSW with the Job Content Questionnaire, and turnover intention with a dedicated 3-item measure. Correlation, multiple regression, and relative weight analyses were conducted. Burnout was not found to be more strongly linked to organizational and work-contextualized variables than to personality traits. In addition, turnover intention was not associated to a greater extent with burnout than with ERI. Burnout and depressive symptoms were highly correlated and exhibited overlapping nomological networks. Overall, our findings question the way burnout has been generally conceived.

TI  - Responding to Those Who Hope for a Miracle: Practices for Clinical Bioethicists
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BIOETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant challenges arise for clinical care teams when a patient or surrogate decision-maker hopes a miracle will occur. This article answers the question, "How should clinical bioethicists respond when a medical decision-maker uses the hope for a miracle to orient her medical decisions?" We argue the ethicist must first understand the complexity of the miracle-invocation. To this end, we provide a taxonomy of miracle-invocations that assist the ethicist in analyzing the invocator's conceptions of God, community, and self. After the ethicist appreciates how these concepts influence the invocator's worldview, she can begin responding to this hope with specific practices. We discuss these practices in detail and offer concrete recommendations for a justified response to the hope for a miracle.

TI  - Influence of soil texture on the estimation of bare soil moisture content using MODIS images
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral behaviour of soil is strongly influenced by the soil texture as well as its nutrient content. Many attempts have so far been made to assess the soil moisture using soil reflectance in different bands of satellite images. In this paper, the investigations showed that the coarse texture soils did not show a profound relationship with the reflectance values that was in part due to its weak water storage capacity. Fine texture soils, on the contrary, showed better results which could be attributed to their higher water storage capacity and the capillary phenomenon. Finally, a linear regression model made of a combination of Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Visible and Short-wave infrared Drought Index (VSDI) indices was proposed. The suggested method has improved the accuracy of the soil moisture content estimation up to 1% in general and the medium texture soil in particular. The results were compared with the performance of seven conventional soil moisture estimators method all using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data.

AB  - Aerosols, suspended particles in the atmosphere, play an important role in the formation of cloud nuclei, climate change, poor air quality and degradation of atmospheric visibility, and public health and diseases. For a full understanding of aerosols effects on urban air quality and public health, retrieval of aerosol optical properties such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) over bright urban surfaces is required. In this study, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) cloud-free images at 30 m spatial resolution were obtained from 2013 to 2017 for the blue (483 nm), green (560 nm) and red (660 nm) channels to retrieve AOD using the Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA). The Minimum Reflectance Technique (MRT) was applied on the composite of Landsat surface reflectance images to estimate surface reflectance for AOD retrievals. Validation of the high-resolution AOD retrievals was conducted against two AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) sites located at bright urban surfaces of Beijing. The quality and error of the AOD retrievals were reported using the Expected Error (EE = +/- (0.05 + 20%)), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative percent mean error (RPME). Results showed that the Landsat 8 AOD retrievals were well-correlated R = 0.98) with the AERONET AOD measurements for each channel with 75% of the retrievals were within the EE, RMSE of 0.11 and RPME of 7%. These results suggest that the SARA algorithm is robust and useful to retrieve high-resolution AOD observations and Landsat 8 can be used for aerosols monitoring over bright urban surfaces of Beijing, which is frequently affected by severe dust storms and haze pollution, to identify their effects on public health.

AB  - In this study, the MODIS Collection (C6) combined Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) aerosol products (DTBC6) at 10 km spatial resolution was validated against AERONET AOD obtained from 68 sites at global scale from 2004-2014 over different vegetated surfaces, i.e., partially-vegetated (NDVIp <= 0.3), moderately-vegetated (0.3 < NDVIM <= 0.5) and densely-vegetated surfaces (NDVID > 0.5) defined by monthly NDVI values obtained from the MOD13A3 product. For comparison purposes, AOD was obtained from the combined DTBSMS product which was developed based on the Simplified Merged Scheme (SMS), i.e., using an average of the DT and DB highest quality AOD retrievals or the available one. Results showed that the number of coincident observations of the DTBSMS increased from 6121 (DTBC6) to 10055 for NDVIP surfaces, from 13371 (DTBC6) to 21438 for NDVIM surfaces, and from 9410 (DTBC6) to 14415 for NDVID surfaces. The percentage of retrievals within the Expected Error (EE = +/- (0.05 + 0.15xAOD) increased by 13-15% and RMB decreased by 31-58%. Overall, the DTBSMS is robust and performed much better than the DTBC6 in terms of spatiotemporal coverage and data quality, and can be used operationally for generation of the merged DT and DB AOD product at global scale.

AB  - The article raises a question about causes of destabilization of value-worldview dominants that are fundamental for Western culture, which authors connect with the understanding of social reality construction mechanisms. In particular, it is suggested to make forms and actions, which help to implement subjective interpretations of reality as a basis of intersubjective social reality, a research problem of philosophical study. These forms are called institutions of intersubjectivity in the article. Game levels of learning intersubjective forms of body, collective and general cultural identity are analyzed, the role of custodians and translators of cultural ontology that change their appearance and ways of social functioning in accordance with the ontological ideas that are relevant for one or another era, is clarified. Authors justify a thesis regarding a question, which states that during the age of development of technologies of mass impact on individual subjectivity cultural identity and senses connected to it can transform up to the essential distortions (changes) of social reality based on them (including value and ideological beliefs), that can and already became a factor of political and market competition in global world.

M3  - Article
AB  - Timely detection of forest fires and reliable assessment of their size, dynamics, and consequences is an important and crucial point. Solving this problem would allow organizing rescue services during a fire more effectively and quickly. Operability and reliability of information make the activities on mitigation their consequences more task-oriented and effective and implement prevention measures more surely. Here, we present the results of processing and analysis of multi-spectral satellite images of low spatial resolution to assess the dynamics and consequences of the forest fires that happened in October-December 2017 on the territory of California. Based on the ERS data of visible and IR range from terra, Aqua, Suomi NPP and Sentinel-3 satellites, the fire sources were revealed, the forest tire dynamics was investigated, the boundaries of burnt-out localities were determined, and the area of affected territories was calculated. A qualitative assessment of reliability of detecting the fire sources (based on smoke plumes and heat anomalies) and a quantitative assessment of the accuracy of determination of fire sources' locations were made by comparing the results of processing the ERS data from MODIS, VIIRS and OLCI imagers with the results of fire detecting on the same days in the same territory obtained using specialized web-services of global satellite fire detection and monitoring. A quantitative assessment of the accuracy of determination of boundaries and areas of burnt-out localities was made by comparing the results of processing the ERS data from low-resolution imagers (MODIS, VIIRS and OLCI) with the results of processing the charge-free medium-resolution images from Sentinel-2A/B and Landsat-7/8 satellites made in the same period in the selected monitored territory and available online. The feasibility and expediency of joint processing, analysis, and interpretation of multi-spectral day-time imaging data and panchromatic night-time imaging data are shown with the aim of increasing the reliability and timeliness of detecting fire sources and assessing the dynamics of fire propagation. To increase the accuracy of determination of areas and boundaries of burnt-out localities, it is necessary to use the medium-resolution ERS data from Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2A / B satellites and from "terra satellite (ASTER imager).

TI  - Ensemble Learning Based Multiple Kernel Principal Component Analysis for Dimensionality Reduction and Classification of Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification is one of the most challenging tasks of remotely sensed data processing, particularly for hyperspectral imaging (HSI). Dimension reduction is widely applied as a preprocessing step for classification; however the reduction of dimension using conventional methods may not always guarantee high classification rate. Principal component analysis (PCA) and its nonlinear version kernel PCA (KPCA) are known as traditional dimension reduction algorithms. In a previous work, a variant of KPCA, denoted as Adaptive KPCA (A-KPCA), is suggested to get robust unsupervised feature representation for HSI. The specified technique employs several KPCAs simultaneously to obtain better feature points from each applied KPCA which includes different candidate kernels. Nevertheless, A-KPCA neglects the influence of subkernels employing an unweighted combination. Furthermore, if there is at least one weak kernel in the set of kernels, the classification performance may be reduced significantly. To address these problems, in this paper we propose an Ensemble Learning (EL) based multiple kernel PCA (M-KPCA) strategy. M-KPCA constructs a weighted combination of kernels with high discriminative ability from a predetermined set of base kernels and then extracts features in an unsupervised fashion. The experiments on two different AVIRIS hyperspectral data sets show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a satisfactory feature extraction performance on real data.

AB  - Indonesia as a maritime continent with abundant natural resources requires a monitoring system of space or satellite remote sensing (RS) to obtain information quickly with broad coverage. Consequently, Indonesia needs to master the ability of earth observation and natural resource exploration satellite based on remote sensing technology. Indonesia currently has mastered the micro class technology satellite system and also has an earth station infrastructure system that receives satellite data. The country considered the need to develop operational satellites nationwide to support the country's self-reliance in the field of remote sensing satellite technology, and national technology development. Considering that the satellite industry is a complex system, it is necessary to apply an engineering analysis system that includes supply chain, business processes, and human resources (HR). This paper discusses the application of the Delphi method in prioritization of alternative key issues related to the Indonesia Remote Sensing Satellite Systems (InaRSSat) initiative. Delphi method is a method for structuring a group communication process so that the group can communicate effectively, allowing a group of individuals, as a whole, to deal with complex problems. This technique is one method of forecasting or estimating, which in this case is aimed at developing a consensus estimate of the future by asking an expert opinion on satellites and remote sensing applications in Indonesia. Stimulatingly, this study used an online method by utilizing website and WhatsApp application and executed in 3 (three) rounds. Results of the study arc that key issues related to business process have more issues and ranked higher in the top 10 in comparison with key issues related to Supply Chain and Human Resources. Within the top ten issues, Business Process contain the following 5 issues: Creating Roadmap, Funding Satellite Project, Aligning National Vision, Increasing synergy of Industry, and improving synergy of RS Satellite development. Meanwhile, supply chain-related issues within the top ten issues are: Building RS Satellite, providing integrated Satellite System, Selecting Satellite technology. Human Resources-related issues are: building HR and improving the quality of education.

TI  - COSMO-SkyMed high resolution fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar exploitation - the "strip-spot' approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This focused study aimed to generate a fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data set of 1m resolution based on the spotlight and stripmap COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) satellite data fusion. The results show the feasibility of overcoming the limitation of the nominal 3m resolution generated by a series of multi-temporal stripmap SAR data observed in all the polarisations. The CSK satellite system does not allow the observation of cross-polar data in the spotlight acquisition mode because only co-polar data are available. In this work, a fully polarimetric scattering matrix is estimated by using two spotlights in the horizontal horizontal (HH) and vertical vertical (VV) polarisations and two stripmaps in the horizontal vertical (HV) and vertical horizontal (VH) polarisations. The stripmaps were resampled and super-resolved by using the amplitude and phase estimation of sinusoids (APES) filter to achieve the spotlight resolution. The results show that the proposed strip-spot approach has immediate operative applications.

AB  - Performance of the Sentinel-3 SRAL altimeter is evaluated in the coastal zones of the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Sea Surface Heights (SSH, processed with the ESA developed SAMOSA 2 retracker) were computed at six passes for 2017 nearby three tide gauge (TG) sites in Estonia. These SSH were compared with the TG records in conjunction with an operational hydrodynamic model (HDM), both referring to a high-resolution national geoid. The Sentinel-3 data quality assessment yielded the root mean square error of 70 mm with respect to the TG+HDM derived SSH. The near-zero mean of discrepancies shows that there is no significant systematic bias between the land-bound geodetic infrastructure and Sentinel-3 SSH data. This accuracy is within the range aimed for modern marine geoid modelling (i.e. 5 cm).

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction: The involvement of the immune system in the process of neoplasms has been increasingly studied due to its potential in antitumor therapy. Objectives: To evaluate the expression of heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) in tissue samples from invasive ductal carcinomas with and without the presence of axillary sentinel lymph node metastasis, as well as to study the relationship of cell proliferation rate (Ki-76) and apoptosis (caspase 3) compared with samples of fibrocystic change in breast tissue. Methods: Cross-sectional study with tissue samples collected at the Hospital Sao Lucas, between September 2001 and October 2009, divided into three groups: 1. fibrocystic breast change (control group); 2. invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast with presence of lymph node metastasis; and 3. absence of lymph node metastasis. Results: Increased Hsp27 expression was observed in the group of non-metastasis carcinomas when compared to the other groups. There was difference in Ki-67 protein expression and in the ratio between cell proliferation and apoptosis among the carcinoma groups compared to the control group. However, there was no significant difference between the carcinoma groups or between the expressions of caspase 3 in the three groups, when compared to each other. Conclusion: Quantitative analysis of Hsp27 demonstrated increased protein expression in primary neoplasm tissues and in lymph nodes in carcinomas without axillary sentinel lymph node metastasis. Although the methodology and the number of cases do not allow concluding that this behavior in metastatic disease is a constant finding, this justifies the need to evaluate this finding in future studies.

TI  - Gulf Stream Detection from SAR Doppler Anomaly
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a Gulf Stream (GS) North Wall (GSNW) detection algorithm applicable to Sentinel-1 Radial surface Velocity (RVL) products derived from Doppler centroid analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected off the east coast of Canada from February 2017 to August 2017. Visual comparison of the extracted location of the GSNW (obtained by evaluating the peak RVL gradient in the azimuth direction), and the estimated location of the GSNW as determined by the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office and a GSNW search region (GSNWSR), indicates that the algorithm is capable of detecting the GSNW in approximate to 80% of the cases evaluated. Results are dependent on the geophysical orientation of the GS across the SAR swath, such that the GSNW detector performed most reliably when the GS was oriented across the swath resulting in maximized surface velocities in the range direction. When the GS meandered, or when GS eddies appeared in the RVL data, the GSNW was often partially detected or detected multiple times, reducing confidence in the extracted location. It is anticipated that the results obtained using the Sentinel-1 RVL products will be applicable to SAR data from other platforms.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Two software development hurdles to advancing real-world operationalization of satellite datasets for water management are addressed in this study. First, a simple, easy-to-build and open-source web portal connecting to a back-end complex model is developed for resource-constrained developing nations. Second, to enhance the skill of satellite-based predictions, an innovative and dynamic web analytics-based correction system is developed to reduce the uncertainty of satellite estimates. The correction system comprises dynamic precipitation bias correction and streamflow correction. Dynamically web crawled in-situ hydrologic data pertaining to the region are used to estimate satellite estimation bias. These corrected datasets are finally shared through theweb portal. On average, these dynamic correction techniques reduced root mean squared error in streamflow by 80-90% for the case of South Asian river basins. The take-home message is that it is now possible to build cost-effective operational web portals based on satellite data and non-proprietary software.

M3  - Article
AB  - Authors illustrate by what means the pedagogical tasks of philosophy and their attitude to such systems of spiritual and moral formation of personality as religion and morality get determined under modern conditions. Philosophy must get rid of claims on the meaning of certain valuable and normative system of upbringing. It must not preach the virtue, but indicate any person to such a start in himself, which will allow him to take the path of spiritual and moral transformation. In this, the specificity of spiritual situation of a person in the contemporary world consists in that civilization and historical prerequisites of ontological, valuable-meaningful, psychological naturalness of confessional-religious way of thinking were irreversibly lost. Modern individual is set in front of the necessity to develop on their own the particular individualized multidimensionality in the conditions of traditional type of worldview identity crisis.The principal limitation of religion is not in containing the proclaimed values, but rather in the form of religious dogma removing the task of developing on their own the worldview references. The faith, in an equal degree of secular and religious, must be a private affair of each person. Its content cannot be generalized in the form of mandatory requirement and institutionalized as a national ideology. Namely the legal form of organization of social and civic life on the basis of discursive consensus is the practical approval of humanity.

AB  - Results of planetary mapping are often shared openly for use in scientific research and mission planning. In its raw format, however, the data is not accessible to non-experts due to the difficulty in grasping the context and the intricate acquisition process. We present work on tailoring and integration of multiple data processing and visualization methods to interactively contextualize geospatial surface data of celestial bodies for use in science communication. As our approach handles dynamic data sources, streamed from online repositories, we are significantly shortening the time between discovery and dissemination of data and results. We describe the image acquisition pipeline, the pre-processing steps to derive a 2.5D terrain, and a chunked level-of-detail, out-of-core rendering approach to enable interactive exploration of global maps and high-resolution digital terrain models. The results are demonstrated for three different celestial bodies. The first case addresses high-resolution map data on the surface of Mars. A second case is showing dynamic processes. such as concurrent weather conditions on Earth that require temporal datasets. As a final example we use data from the New Horizons spacecraft which acquired images during a single flyby of Pluto. We visualize the acquisition process as well as the resulting surface data. Our work has been implemented in the OpenSpace software [8], which enables interactive presentations in a range of environments such as immersive dome theaters. interactive touch tables. and virtual reality headsets.

AB  - For one year, underrepresented minority students majoring in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) were engaged in a rigorous geoscience program that trained and equipped them with basic geoscience knowledge and geoscience workforce skills that adequately prepared them for entry level geoscience career building positions. Preliminary results from this young program with its small sample size (with a sample size of 10, caution should be exercised in generalizing these results) are extremely encouraging; They show that the program's geoscience remote sensing research internship produced significant student gains in a variety of remote sensing skills that range from interpreting, manipulating, and analyzing remote sensing data to conducting and presenting remote sensing research. Some of these students have also now joined the geoscience workforce as interns.

TI  - Mapping Wetlands and Land Cover Change with Landsat Archives: The Added Value of Geomorphologic Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While classification of remote sensing images has proven useful to quantify wetland losses, wetland mappers have always faced challenges, such as dealing with variable responses of wetlands to meteorological conditions and the obstruction of ground by the canopy in forested wetlands. In this paper, we investigate the added value of using geomorphological data, namely hillslope geometry (through Dikau shapes) and soil drainage classes, as ancillary datasets to map the evolution of wetland cover over the last 35 years. We developed an object-based image analysis method, through a case study in Quebec. Two sets of land cover scenarios (spring and fall) were generated from Landsat archives for 1978, 1985, 1992, 2001, and 2014. Results show that the global accuracy was improved by 19% to 35% when using the geomorphological data, especially soil drainage classes, confirming that their use as ancillary data significantly contributed to the classification process. However, differences were noted between spring and fall scenarios. The wetland cover of the study watershed decreased by 8%-53% between 1978 and 2014 at the expense of an increase in urban areas. Meanwhile, the agricultural land cover decreased (72%-83%) throughout the study period, while forests, water, and bare soil remained stable.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article extends a rate-allocation method based on the near-lossless-rate (NLR) complexity that is designed to operate on-board spacecrafts, to include support for distortion scaling factors, such as those that are needed to code multi-and hyperspectral image when a spectral transform is employed. In this article, the conditions to achieve global minimum distortion are derived under the rate-distortion model based on the NLR complexity for the case of varying distortion scaling factors. Practical implementation issues are dealt with, and a rate-allocation method capable of operating under the constraints of on-board operation is provided. An exhaustive experimental validation of the rate-allocation method is performed, reporting modest performances for low rates and close to optimal performances for high rates.

AB  - The paper deals with the issues of psychological and pedagogical support of the academic staff working with students with disabilities in the context of inclusive education. The relevance of the research is due to the difficulties in implementing the inclusive approach in Russian higher schools and need to train academic staff in working with students with special needs. Interviewing and rating academic staff members, (120 persons,) have revealed difficulties (philosophic-worldview, project-technological, and psychological-pedagogic) they face when teaching students with disabilities. The resource of further education can be used to overcome the revealed obstacles. Based on the example of teaching according to a specially designed program for further training, it has been shown that it helps to form relevant competencies and preparedness to work with students with disabilities.. The paper may be useful for higher school managers and academic staff and teachers in intermediate vocational education establishments who work in a climate of inclusion as well as for specialists engaged in supplementary professional education.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - This paper addresses the problem of up-scaling full polarimetric (quad-pol) parameters from small quad-pol synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes to large dual-pol scenes, using a sophisticated Machine Learning (ML) method, namely the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The approach is to let the GPR model learn the relationships between the dual-pol input data and the quad-pol parameters on a quad-pol scene, and then extrapolate the relationships to the whole dual-pol scene. We demonstrate the procedure on two pairs of quadpol Radarsat-2 (RS2) and dual-pol ScanSAR Sentinel-1 (S1) scenes, acquired less than 20 minutes apart. The results are visualised as pixel-wise parametric maps, supported by three quantitative regression performance measures. In addition, we show certainty level maps for the estimated parameters. Our results indicate the potential of using the ML GPR model to upscale quad-pol scenes to large dual-pol images.

TI  - Phenology of Trichodesmium spp. blooms in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, Australia, from the ESA-MERIS 10-year mission
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Trichodesmium, a filamentous bloom-forming marine cyanobacterium, plays a key role in the biogeochemistry of oligotrophic ocean regions because of the ability to fix nitrogen. Naturally occurring in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the contribution of Trichodesmium to the nutrient budget may be of the same order as that entering the system via catchment runoff. However, the cyclicity of Trichodesmium in the GBR is poorly understood and sparsely documented because of the lack of sufficient observations. This study provides the first systematic analysis of Trichodesmium spatial and temporal occurrences in the GBR over the decade-long MERIS ocean color mission (2002-2012). Trichodesmium surface expressions were detected using the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) applied to MERIS satellite imagery of the GBR lagoonal waters. The MCI performed well (76%), albeit tested on a limited set of images (N = 25) coincident with field measurements. A north (Cape York) to south (Fitzroy) increase in the extent, frequency and timing of the surface expressions characterized the GBR, with surface expressions extending over several hundreds of kilometers. The two southernmost subregions Mackay and Fitzroy accounted for the most (70%) bloom events. The bloom timing of Trichodesmium varied from May in the north to November in the south, with wet season conditions less favorable to Trichodesmium aggregations. MODIS-Aqua Sea Surface Temperature (SST) datasets, wind speed and field measurements of nutrient concentrations were used in combination with MCI positive instances to assess the blooms driving factors. Low wind speed (-1) and SST 24°C were associated with the largest surface aggregations. Generalized additive models (GAM) indicated an increase in bloom occurrences over the 10-year period with seasonal bloom patterns regionally distinct. Interannual variability in SST partially (14%) explained bloom occurrences, and other drivers, such as the subregion and the nutrient budget, likely regulate Trichodesmium surface aggregations in the GBR.

AB  - NOAA-20 (formerly JPSS-1) is a new polar-orbiting weather satellite launched on 18 November 2017. VIIRS is one of five instruments onboard NOAA-20, and it joints on orbit the previous VIIRS instrument operating on the Suomi NPP spacecraft since November 2011. During post-launch testing, accuracy of VIIRS sensor data record (SDR) geolocation products was evaluated using a ground control point matching program. The control points are based on 30-m Landsat images, and the matchups employ their cross-correlation with the 375-m VIIRS images in band I 1 . Initial NOAA-20 VIIRS geolocation uncertainty after launch exceeded 2 km and was somewhat larger than the initial uncertainty previously observed for S-NPP. Optimization of processing parameters successfully reduced the uncertainty to less than 200 m (3-sigma or CE95), which is comparable to the current geolocation uncertainty for the S-NPP VIIRS SDR products. The improvement was achieved by adjusting only the instrument-to-spacecraft rotation angles (the "mounting matrix"). While the uncertainty evaluation was based on global matchups collected over the entire 16-day orbit repeat period, the optimization was based on reprocessing a two-day set of VIIRS SDR from North Africa and the Middle East. Geolocation of the 750-m Day/Night Band (DNB), which is not co-registered with the 375-m I-bands and the 750-m M-bands, was evaluated and optimized separately, using observations of point sources and comparisons between DNB and the Il band. Initial NOAA-20 VIIRS DNB geolocation uncertainty was even larger than that observed for the other bands, but it was successfully reduced to approximately 200 m by adjusting DNB-specific processing parameters.

AB  - According to the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, changes in land use through urbanization and agriculture are the key anthropogenic effects of climate change. Thus, the preservation of natural environment of urban areas is essential for conserving water and soil, while still adjusting the microclimatic variables (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, etc.) and stabilizing the natural ecological system from destruction. It has been observed that most parts of city's green vegetation have been lost due to housing developments and commercial activities. This study was carried out to assess the effect of the change in land use on a modern city like Sunyani, by observing the significant changes in vegetation cover from LANDSAT TM imagery over a 31-year period (1986 - 2017). From the study, there was significant decline of vegetation cover from 1986 to 1999, and no significant change from 1999 to 2017. There were also significant changes in the built-up areas from 1986 to 1999 and no significant change from 1999 to 2017. Adoption of sustainable and environmentally friendly technologies that maintain open green vegetation is recommended for future city planning.

TI  - SOMATISMS IN MODERN NICKNAMES OF THE PERM REGION
T2  - VOPROSY ONOMASTIKI-PROBLEMS OF ONOMASTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a many-faceted approach to the study of the names of body parts attested in modern nicknames of the residents of the Perm region. With over 360 instances of such names collected, the author was able to: 1) compile a register of the reconstructed somatisms, with most productive lexemes also identified, 2) describe the features and functions of the mentioned body parts which happen to be more relevant to nominators, 3) define the "naive anatomy" characteristic of the nicknames, compared to the scientific view. Incidentally, the study discovers a certain "asymmetry" in the description of Homo Somatic the nicknames showcase: the individual organs and their systems may be presented in a detailed / exaggerated / lacunar ways; quite often these onyms are motivated by the names of the prominent exterior elements of the front-upper part of a body (face, mouth), or a belly (mostly that of pregnant women). The nicknames make note of protruding / overhanging features of the said parts, an unusually large size, unusual shape, their excessive character compared to the average, and so on. Functionally-driven scientific accounts of body parts as life necessities are irrelevant to the "naive anatomy". The everyday language use focuses rather on its own functional and pragmatic aspects. The human body becomes more of a spatial object with its own "landscape" and "topography". In this regard, somatisms are seen as "landmarks" of the anatomical space, so as the somatically-motivated nicknames act like the landmarks of social space (anthroponyms are a means of distinguishing a "friend" from a "foe"). It is concluded that modern nicknames of the residents of the Perm Region derived from the somatic vocabulary reflect the viability of genetic ties between the names of body parts with the traditional worldview, as much as they testify to the discrepancies between the "naive" and the scientific principles of describing the human anatomy. The nicknames also draw upon the traditional binary oppositions of "friend / foe", "front / rear", "upper / lower", whereas the opposition of "right / left" is irrelevant.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - The authors propose that the spatial structure of woody vegetation on former arable lands can be used as a diagnostic feature that indicates the occurrence or absence of grass fires after land abandonment. Based on the analysis of a series of Landsat satellite images from 1985 to 2016 for an area of 256.5 km(2) located in Central European Russia, the authors have reconstructed the history of spring fire events. They found correlations between the frequency of fire events and the density and spatial structure of woody vegetation on abandoned arable lands. Without fires, areas with homogeneous woody vegetation are formed: individuals of pioneer tree species (Betula pendula, B. pubescens and Salix caprea) are evenly distributed and exist in high densities over the entire area. Affected by fires, trees become unevenly distributed over the area: pioneer trees grow in groups or as separate individuals depending on the intensity and frequency of grass fires. With frequent fires, the vegetation remains in a weedy stage for decades.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objectives of the research work were to determine the usefulness of Landsat and SPOT data for monitoring various forest parameters, and to assess the impact of changeable climatic conditions with the use of vegetation indices derived from remotely sensed data. Vegetation indices describing various aspects of plant condition and vegetation structure were derived from satellite images, and their values were analysed in a temporal profile in different vegetation seasons, in conjunction with meteorological parameters. The results of analyses proved that dedicated vegetation indices of water stress in plants - the disease water stress index (DSWI) and normalized difference infrared index (NDII) - are able to detect changeable climatic conditions, especially the impact of drought on forest ecosystems. The indices are also useful for characterising types of forest site and tree stand mixture, in particular differentiating dry, fresh and humid forest sites. Results of analysis of satellite-based indices were supported by conclusions drawn from a study of vegetation parameters obtained in the course of field campaigns.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SPACE OPTICS-ICSO 2018
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Space Optics (ICSO)
CL  - Chania, GREECE
AB  - IBS Coatings are a good candidate for high performance applications. They are hard, dense, exhibit a small thermal shift, and have the best scattering and surface roughness performance of the various coating technologies. In addition, they feature a highly stable refractive index for the coated materials allowing the production of complex coatings. Because of their high density and resistance towards high energy radiation IBS coatings are also well suited for space applications. For high power laser applications, the vacuum stable damage threshold and low defect concentration qualify especially reactive ion beam sputtering as a suitable deposition method for space applications.In the paper, results on coating activities using the IBS process are discussed in respect to two aspects. One is the adaption of the IBS to strongly curved surfaces like lenses exemplified by the FM lenses for the Copernicus Sentinel-4 mission. The other is a study to increase the laser-induced damage threshold for future LIDAR systems. This is accomplished by eliminating nano-scaled particles that act as damage precursors during laser radiation.

AB  - Endometrial cancer (EC) represents the most common gynecological neoplasm in developed countries. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for EC. Although EC is characterized by a high prevalence several features regarding its management are still unclear. In particular the execution of lymphadenectomy is controversial. The recent introduction of sentinel node mapping represents the mid-way between the execution and omission of node dissection in EC patients. In the present review we discuss the emerging role of sentinel node mapping in EC. In addition, we discussed how type of tracers utilized and site of injection impacted on sentinel node detection rates. Future perspective regarding EC management are also discussed.

TI  - Evaluative Senses in Russian Grammar (on the basis of verbs of emotional attitude)
T2  - VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV-SERIYA LINGVISTIKA-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the evaluative characteristics of lexis which are reflected in Russian grammar. The idea of semantic basis of grammar, created and developed by Anna Wierzbicka, has a continuation in the study of role and place of evaluative senses in productive grammar of the Russian language. The activity approach to the description of the language, adopted in this paper, involves studying the role of a subjective factor in Russian grammar. The article demonstrates the results of research aimed at the analysis of semantic space of Russian verbs. The aim of the work is to identify evaluative senses that are important for grammar and to demonstrate how the subjective component of the verb meaning influences the way of expressing its actant positions. The research has been conducted using the methods and operational procedures of component analysis, equivalent substitutions and context transformations, modeling and a linguistic experiment. The work has been carried out on the material of Russian dictionaries with the use of data from the National Corpus of the Russian language. As a result, the connection between intellectual and emotional evaluative characteristics of verb having an output in the grammatical space of the language has been established. It was demonstrated that evaluation (positive or negative), which verbal semantics contains, affects the syntagmatic behavior of the verb selectively and requires additional efforts in solving the problem of establishing those semantic zones where the role of evaluation component in the grammatical formulation of actant positions is the most significant. One of such semantic spheres is verbal lexicon which denotes the subject's attitude to his/her own actions. Positive or negative evaluation in this case is significant for making the verb actant frame. The obtained results let raise the question of identifying the vector of estimation orientation in Russian grammar. The study of verbal semantics in its projection on syntagmatic properties makes it possible to find a new perspective for the disclosure of national-specific worldview. The continuation of the research in chosen direction could contribute to the development of comparative axiology.

T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Basing on the fiction prose, poetry and essays by D.S. Merezhkovsky, S.N. Bulgakov, G.I. Chulkov, I.A. Bunin, M.M. Prishvin, A.M. Remizov, S.N. Durylin, M.A. Voloshin etc., the article considers one of the most important modifications of the motive "allegations of the land" in the Russian literature of the revolutionary years (1917-1920s), that is to say, relying on its saving power against those Russians who, according to the above-mentioned authors, betrayed their country. It is shown how in the aftermath of the fire of the 1917 revolution, the shift in Russian worldview, due to rupture of the everlasting concepts of "land" and "people", that "land" became the main bearer of "Holiness" as a national identity. In the view of the people's "unworthiness" in the era of the Russian disaster (the World War I, the victorious revolution and the Civil War), the center of gravity in the composition of the Motherland concept, Russia, moved to its other component. i.e. the land, the "holiness" of which needed more justification and approval. The paler the idea of a "God-bearing" people became, the brighter was the belief in the "holiness" of the native land in the Russian literature of 1900-1910s. In 1916, the "eternal" image of "Holy Russia" was finally displayed in the Orthodox Church hymnography. In 1918, the following famous verse was added in the divine service to all Russian saints: "Holy Russia, keep the Orthodox faith <...>". In this regard, in a number of literary texts the related mythologems "Holy Russia" and "Invisible city of Kitezh" were considered, having received a special soteriological significance in the period of radical breakage, dangerous to the very existence of historical Russia.

T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Many environmental data are inherently imbalanced, with some majority land use and land cover types dominating over rare ones. In cultivated ecosystems minority classes are often the target as they might indicate a beginning land use change. Most standard classifiers perform best on a balanced distribution of classes, and fail to detect minority classes. We used the synthetic minority oversampling technique (smote) with Random Forest to classify land cover classes in a small agricultural catchment in South Korea using modis time series. This area faces a major soil erosion problem and policy measures encourage farmers to replace annual by perennial crops to mitigate this issue. Our major goal was therefore to improve the classification performance on annual and perennial crops. We compared four different classification scenarios on original imbalanced and synthetically oversampled balanced data to quantify the effect of smote on classification performance. smote substantially increased the true positive rate of all oversampled minority classes. However, the performance on minor classes remained lower than on the majority class. We attribute this result to a class overlap already present in the original data set that is not resolved by smote. Our results show that resampling algorithms could help to derive more accurate land use and land cover maps from freely available data. These maps can be used to provide information on the distribution of land use classes in heterogeneous agricultural areas and could potentially benefit decision making. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB  - Radar altimetry, initially developed to observe the surface topography of the ocean, is now commonly used for the monitoring of inland water bodies. In this study, an altimetry-based gauging network was built in the Ogooue River Basin (ORB), in Gabon, Central Africa. It is composed of altimetry-based virtual stations (VS) under the altimetry tracks of ERS-2/ENVISAT/SARAL, Cryosat-2, Sentinel-3A and Jason-2/Jason-3. River discharge was estimated from 1995 to 2017 combining water level records from several virtual stations close to Lambarene gauge station and the rating curve from this station. Very good agreement was found in terms of R (>0.95), RMSE and annual discharge.

T2  - EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS IX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - In the last few years, image acquisition modes have been developed for spaceborne SAR systems aiming on an enhancement of geometric resolution. This offers new opportunities for the calculation of so-called sub-aperture images and their analysis. Due to the increase of illumination time, one single image can be subdivided into multiple sub-apertures, which are temporarily closely arranged to each other with a lower geometric resolution than the original image. Focusing on this increase of illumination time, the Staring Spotlight (ST) mode of the German TerraSAR-X (TSX) and TanDEM-X (TDX) satellite constellation is mentionable. Here, the azimuth bandwidth can be divided into subset images, in which e. g. vehicles or ships are still well observable. Consequently, moving targets can be detected without utilizing SAR raw data. For this, only a Single Look Complex (SLC) image has to be considered.In this study, different stacks consisting of sub-aperture images are calculated, which are used for incoherent change detection. The detection is performed as an adaption of a method for change analysis in SAR time series data developed earlier. This method comprises the detailed description of changes, concerning their categorization and classification. Therefore, suitable features have to be calculated leading to a clear distinction of different change categories.As test data, TSX SLC images are used which were acquired both in ST and in High Resolution Spotlight (HS) mode. An assessment concerning their suitability for the incoherent change detection method applied to the sub-apertures is given. With future studies, it will be tested, whether the temporal aspect can be meaningfully regarded for the change categorization step. For this, the concept of so-called high activity objects, which were the basis of the earlier developed change analysis scheme, might be of relevance for the analysis of changes in sub-aperture sequences.

AB  - The current study compared two approaches for estimating change of aboveground biomass (AGB) in montane forests in Norway using field- and remotely sensed data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) from two points in time (four-year interval). The first was an indirect method that involved modeling and prediction of AGB at two points in time using ALS metrics as predictors, estimating the change from differences between AGB predictions. The second was a direct method, where change was modeled and predicted directly using differences between corresponding ALS metrics derived at the two measurement occasions as predictors, and the estimate was based on the predicted differences. Both methods were applied over a 1500 km long and 250 m wide transect from south to north in Norway comprising 250 m(2) grid cells. The results showed that the indirect method was more precise than the direct method. The indirect method estimated 0.65 Mg ha(-1) change in AGB over the observation period, with a corresponding 95% confidence interval of +/- 0.27 Mg ha(-1). The corresponding figures for the direct method was 0.54 and +/- 0.51 Mg ha(-1). The direct method has been recommended previously. We conclude that the indirect method is both more precise and versatile.

T2  - BIOTECHNOLOGIE AGRONOMIE SOCIETE ET ENVIRONNEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Description of the subject. Understanding the current situation and evolution of forests is essential for a sustainable management plan that maintains forests' ecological and socio-economic functions. Remote sensing is a helpful tool in developing this knowledge.Objectives. This paper investigates the new opportunities offered by using Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery for forest mapping in Belgian Ardenne ecoregion. The first classification objective was to create a forest map at the regional scale. The second objective was the discrimination of 11 forest classes (Fagus sylvatica L., Betula sp., Quercus sp., other broad-leaved stands, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco, Larix sp., Pinus sylvestris L., Picea abies (L.) H. Karst., young needle-leaved stands, other needle-leaved stands, and recent clear-cuts).Method. Two S2 scenes were used and a series of spectral indices were computed for each. We applied supervised pixel-based classifications with a Random Forest classifier. The classification models were processed with a pure S2 dataset and with additional 3D data to compare obtained precisions.Results. 3D data slightly improved the precision of each objective, but the overall improvement in accuracy was only significant for objective 1. The produced forest map had an overall accuracy of 93.3%. However, the model testing tree species discrimination was also encouraging, with an overall accuracy of 88.9%.Conclusions. Because of the simple analyses done in this study, results need to be interpreted with caution. However, this paper confirms the great potential of S2 imagery, particularly SWIR and red-edge bands, which are the most important S2 bands in our study.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study to investigate the glacial geomorphological dynamics of the ice-free areas in the Peninsula Potter, King George Island, Antarctica, in response to the recent Polar Club Glacier retreat processes. The geomorphological mapping and lacustrine systems evolution modelling between 2006-2011 were obtained with Quickbird (RGB432) image, application of the spatial digital filters in COSMO-SkyMed (cross and co-polarization, spotlight mode) images and topographic profiles visual interpretations. The methodology considered hypsometry, slope, contour and shaded relief maps of the peninsula, as. The Polar Club Glacier frontal variation between 1981-2015 was obtained with Landsat temporal analysis. The Potter Peninsula geomorphological mapping evidenced the proglacial and geomorphological processes and the spatial distribution pattern of linear marginal to ice features, as morainic ridges and glaciofluvial features, related to the contribution of the seasonal melting of snow and ice, marine terraces, ravines and rocky outcrops. The frontal glacier fluctuations modelling indicated that last glacial advance condition recorded by proglacial geomorphologic can be related Little Ice Age and continuous retreat process. Between 1981-2015 the Polar Club glacier lost 2.95km(2) of total area (9.4% of total area). The retreat process can be related to the trend of rising average temperatures in recent decades, trend of increase in days with liquid precipitation in summer and the number melting degree days in last decades. The Polar Club Glacier retreat is not very significant when compared to other glaciers of King George Island, however, when observing the exposed areas was evident that there was a significant increase (36.9%). The moraine deposits evolution analysis in Peninsula Potter provided conditions for identify three phases of moraines deposition and that show past glacier front positions during periods of glacier marginal stabilization. The analysis of the evolution of lacustrine systems in the study area evidenced changes in proglacial lakes during last 34 years in response of glacial retreat dynamics.

AB  - Daily Maximum Temperature (DMT) is important variable for a wide range of field such as agriculture, climate, and disaster management. There is Automated Weather Station (AWS) operated by Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). AWS gathers the data such as temperature and rainfall. However, AWS is not installed with consideration of land cover. Therefore, there is a lack of temperature information for areas where AWS is not installed. In this study, we made an algorithm to generate daily maximum temperature image using stepwise regression to fill the lack. We set the AWS DMT as dependent variable, and Landsat-8 Land Surface Temperature (LST), Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Normalized Difference Built-in Index (NDBI) as independent variables. We used selected variables, which are LST, NDWI, and NDBI, and made an algorithm. Produced images were compared and validated with ground observation data. Correlation between AWS and Landsat-8 DMT is 0.76, and averaged RMSE is about 2.36(degrees C). It is considered that the accuracy of our algorithm is verified because correlation and RMSE are within the error range of the previous studies.

CL  - Frankfurt, GERMANY
AB  - In the frame of the Sentinel-5 mission, Leonardo is developing the Short-Wave Infrared Spectrometer (SWIR-SS), part of the UVNS instrument foreseen to be embarked on board of the MetOP-SG satellite. S5 instrument objective is to monitor the composition of Earth atmosphere by taking measurements of trace gases and aerosols impacting air quality and climate, providing daily coverage of Earth atmosphere at an unprecedented resolution. SWIR-SS baseline architecture is a pushbroom imaging spectrometer with two channels, [1589 divided by 1676] nm and [2304 divided by 2386] nm, with a spectral resolution of less than 0.25 mu At the object space is located a Slit-Homogenizer, a special component which guides the optical path across the slit in order to mitigate radiometric errors arising from scene heterogeneity. Its behaviour introduces an astigmatism which is corrected at collimator level by making use of a cylindrical lens. Light is then guided towards the dispersers and is focused onto the detector by the cameras lens. Pupil anamorphism, smile and keystone due to dispersers, immersed gratings, are corrected by using a prism and combining the distortion/lateral color of collimator and focusing cameras in both optical channels. A low pass filter at the dichroic splits the wavelengths, while, for each channel, two successive coatings on front and back faces of the prisms select the band and mitigate out-of-band straylight. The design has the purpose to keep the alignment of each subsystem simple, as no aberration compensations have been foreseen between collimator and focusing camera. It shows robustness, stability vs temperature and high optical quality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Burkina Faso was one of the first African nations to introduce pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5, RotaTeq) into its national immunization program in October 2013. We describe the impact and effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine on acute gastroenteritis (AGE) hospitalizations among Burkinabe children.METHODS: Sentinel hospital-based surveillance for AGE was conducted at four hospitals during December 2013 - February 2017. Demographic, clinical, and vaccination information was collected and stool specimens were tested by EIA. Trends in rotavirus AGE hospitalizations and changes in the proportion of AGE hospitalizations due to rotavirus were examined at two sentinel sites from January 2014 - December 2016. Unconditional logistic regression models using data from all 4 surveillance sites were used to calculate vaccine effectiveness (VE, defined as 1-odds ratio) by comparing the odds of vaccination among rotavirus AGE (cases) and non-rotavirus AGE (controls) patients, controlling for age, season, hospital site and socioeconomic factors.RESULTS: The proportion of AGE hospitalizations that tested positive for rotavirus declined significantly among children <5 years of age, from 36% (154/422) in 2014 to 22% (71/323, 40% reduction, p < .01) in 2015 and 20% (61/298, 44% reduction, p < .01) in 2016. Among infants, the percentage of AGE admissions due to rotavirus fell significantly from 38% (94/250) in 2014 to 21% (32/153, 44% reduction, p < .01) in 2015 and 17% (26/149, 54% reduction, p < .01) in 2016. The adjusted VE for full 3-dose series of RV5 against rotavirus hospitalization was 58% (95% [CI], 10%, 81%) in children 6-11 months of age and 19% (-78%, 63%) in children ≥12 months.CONCLUSION: Rotavirus hospitalizations declined after introduction of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine in children, particularly among infants. RV5 significantly protected against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants, but effectiveness decreased in older children.

T2  - SURGICAL AND RADIOLOGIC ANATOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - The cutaneous lymphatic system of the trunk is a complex network, the anatomical knowledge of which remains unclear. The lymphatic system plays a major role in the dissemination of lymphophilic cancers like melanomas. The aim of this study was to improve our knowledge, optimize the care of patients with cutaneous tumors of the trunk, and to use our clinical experience of the topography of pathologic lymph nodes related to cutaneous melanomas and depicted by lymphoscintigraphy.This prospective study included 90 consecutive patients who had primary resection of cutaneous melanoma of the trunk between June 2011 and January 2015. All patients had lymphatic mapping by lymphoscintigraphy, followed by sentinel lymph node procedure. We compared data of lymphatic imaging (lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT-CT) and surgery. We divided the trunk into 36 regions based on cutaneous anatomical landmarks to determine the topography of the lymphatic system for each tumor.Our study showed cutaneous lymphatic drainage of melanomas of the trunk in 16 different areas. This drainage could be single or multiple. We observed that drainage could be controlateral in medial regions of the trunk, and lymphatic pathway could be retrograde. This drainage could be bilateral for medial regions and mainly into axillary areas for regions above L1 level. Posterior regions of the trunk had more diversity of drainage areas than anterior regions.Cutaneous lymphatic drainage of the trunk was not limited to axillary and inguinal areas, showed interindividual variability, and was single or multiple, unilateral or bilateral, and unpredictable.

TI  - Calibrating the SAR SSH of Sentinel-3A and CryoSat-2 over the Corsica Facilities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Initially developed to monitor the performance of TOPEX/Poseidon and to follow the Jason legacy satellite altimeters at Senetosa Cape, Corsica, this calibration/validation site has been extended to include a new location at Ajaccio. This addition enables the site to monitor Envisat and ERS missions, CryoSat-2 and, more recently, the SARAL/AltiKa mission and Sentinel-3A satellites. Sentinel-3A and CryoSat-2 carry altimeters that use a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode that is different to the conventional pulse-bandwidth limited altimeters often termed low resolution mode (LRM). The aim of this study is to characterize the sea surface height (SSH) bias of the new SAR altimeter instruments and to demonstrate the improvement of data quality close to the coast. Moreover, some passes of Sentinel-3A and CryoSat-2 overfly both Senetosa and Ajaccio with only a few seconds time difference, allowing us to evaluate the reliability and homogeneity of both ground sites in term of geodetic datum. The Sentinel-3A and CryoSat-2 SSH biases for the SAR mode are respectively +22 +/- 7 mm and -73 +/- 5 mm (for CryoSat-2 baseline C products). The results show that the stability of the SAR SSH bias time series is better than standard LRM altimetry. Moreover, compared to standard LRM data, for which the measurements closer than similar to 10 km from the coast were generally unusable, SAR mode altimeters provide measurements that are reliable at less than few hundred meters from the coast.

AB  - In this study we compare supervised and unsupervised classification for land use/cover classes from hyperspectral and multispectral imagery. The algorithms include migrating means clustering (MMC) and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN). We were analyzed and compared Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion hyperspectral data to Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Advance Land Imager (ALI) multispectral data. Validation of the derived land-use/cover maps from the above two algorithms was performed through error matrix statistics using the validation points from the very high resolution imagery. Results show that both classification have high accuracy and useful for land use/cover classification but supervised classification slightly outperforming than unsupervised classification by overall higher classification accuracy and kappa statistics. In addition, it is demonstrated that the hyperspectral satellite image provides more accurate classification results than those extracted from the multispectral satellite image. The higher classification accuracy by KNN supervised was attributed principally to the ability of this classifier to identify optimal separating classes with low generalization error, thus producing the best possible classes' separation.

T2  - URBAN ECOLOGY, WATER QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The manifestation of effects of urbanization on the thermal environment of a city is often related to Urban Heat Island (UHI) by various studies. The presence of abnormal warmth in urban areas as compared to rural surroundings is defined as UHI. Satellite images in thermal infrared can be used for assessing thermal environment as well as for defining Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) in urban areas. In this chapter, Guwahati city and its surrounding areas have been studied to observe the changes in the thermal environment that has occurred between the years 1989 and 2010 by means of satellite images provided by Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) onboard Landsat 5. A range of influences have been investigated in the form of relationship between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Radiant Surface Temperature (Ts) to see the influence of sensible heat flux and urban density over the urban vegetation as an indicator of modified temperature regime over the years. The study tried to quantify the UHI phenomenon in the city by measuring Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII) using remote sensing technique. The objective of the study was to quantify changes in the urban thermal environment of Guwahati, a rapidly growing city of Northeast India, which will help in studying various effects of urbanization in future.

AB  - From literature, NDVI proved to be correlated to vigour and midday stem water potential of vines; NDWI to soil water content. It is thus expected that significant periodicities can be found looking at spectral indices time series. This can be useful to better interpret vines behaviour and, possibly, relate intra-vineyard macroscopic differences to this type of information. To preliminarily test this hypothesis 25 Landsat 8 OLI images, Level-2 Data Products, were processed to compute NDVI and NDWI time series. An interpolation step aimed at generating daily estimates of indices in the explored period (May 2013-February 2016) was performed. Successively vegetation effects were removed from NDWI to emphasize soil signal. Finally a FFT analysis of both NDVI and NDWI interpolated time series was achieved to explore their periodicity, giving a first agronomic interpretation of results.

AB  - A time series of Landsat 8 OLI multispectral images acquired in the period May 2013 - February 2016 was used to investigate vineyard behaviour in terms of vigour and water content. The study site was located in the Castel del Monte DOCG area; a 'Moscato Reale' (syn. 'Moscato Bianco') vineyard was analysed. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) were calculated for all images (preventively calibrated and atmospherically corrected) to describe, at pixel level (30x30 m), vigour, plant and soil water status. Spectral indices cyclicity was also assessed to explore dynamics of vines growing season. Satellite derived information was compared with ground parameters (midday stem water potential and soil water content), correlation tested and regression models for parameter estimation calibrated. Periodicity of vigour (NDVI) and water content (NDWI') along time was described using a Fast Fourier Transform approach, finding that the most vigorous part of vineyard corresponded to the most regular (cyclic) ones. Middle resolution multispectral imagery from satellite can be effectively used, at vineyard level, to describe cyclicity, water status and soil moisture. This is an important issue to focus on since, as Landsat OLI dataset is free, the entire process is economic enough to be consistent with cost and income of the farming system.

AB  - In Earth observations the reference spectra of well-described objects are required for better object-oriented interpretation of remotely sensed data from laboratory, field, airborne, and satellite sensors. For this purpose measurements of spectra using laboratory and field spectrometers are performed. The acquired spectra are used in creating a thematic spectral library. The used spectral instruments work in the wavelengths (0.4 to 2.5 microns) covering the spectral ranges from the visible /VIS/ to the shortwave infrared /SWIR/. Two different spectrometers are used to measure spectra included in the library: (1) Thematically oriented multichannel spectrometer covering the spectral range 0.4 to 0.9 microns and (2) high resolution NIRQuest spectrometer covering the range from 0.9 to 2.5 microns, both models of Ocean Optics Inc. Spectrometric measurements of representative samples of minerals, rocks, related soils, vegetation, and their natural mixtures are made in laboratory and field conditions. In some cases, samples were purified, so that the unique spectral characteristics of the studied objects could be related to their typical structure. The relations between the spectra and the structures are important for interpreting remotely sensed data acquired in the field or from an air-or space-borne platform. In some cases for making easy wide use of the spectra in the library the obtained spectra have to resample to selected broadband multispectral sensors for example those based on the satellites Landsat and Sentinel. The obtained spectral data with the metadata and additional information are planned for including in files for better interpretation of images with different spatial resolution.

AB  - Adolescence as a period of personality formation needs values as benchmarks. The subject of the study is the spiritual and moral development of adolescents, taking into account the specificity of their worldview. The aim of the research is to specify the principles and methods of spiritually oriented dialogue with adolescents. Objectives of the study are as follows: the definition of modern approaches to psychological and pedagogical intercommunion with adolescents based on spiritually oriented dialogue by Tamara Florenskaya; working out of optimal methods and questionnaires for collecting empirical data on teenagers' values; the selection of literary works for inclusion in spiritually oriented dialogues with adolescents.We study the prevention of deviance among adolescents by means of a word implemented even at the stage of diagnostic activities, the development dynamics analysis, and therefore use not only observations, but also questionnaires, expanding the respondent's subjective role. The research on the main features of the spiritual and moral development of modern teenagers living in different social and regional conditions, with more than 4 thousand respondents of different faith, required the questionnaire on basic social and spiritual values. True literature with high moral content shapes the teenager's style of speech, thinking, affects the way of life, leads through repentance to the transformation. The spiritually oriented dialogue with teenagers including masterpieces centered on human personalities' development makes prevention of deviations possible. Thus, an awareness of the human path takes place through the human word addressed to the soul. (C) 2018 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

AB  - An algorithm has been developed to determine the annual dose of UV solar radiation for outdoor workers. The dose is indirectly assessed basing on satellite data, mean global irradiance values, workers' data obtained by means of a questionnaire and corrective coefficients provided by a mathematical model. The values obtained by the use of the algorithm are compared with those obtained by measurement records in different environments. Results demonstrated that the algorithm estimates the mean daily erythemal dose with good approximation.

AB  - Optical based remote sensing plays an important role in citrus crop change monitoring in Florida, United States (U.S). However, persistent cloud cover during the summer growing season in Florida often limits the application of optical sensors. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the advantage over optical data by operating at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover, rain or a lack of illumination. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of using Sentinel-1A C-band SAR data for classifying citrus in Florida. Twelve individual citrus classifications produced using single date optical or SAR data, as well as multi-date optical and SAR data fusion, are designed and tested. It is found that the classification accuracies of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data are slightly lower than those of multi-temporal cloud free optical data (approximately 2.5% difference). However, the relatively comparable classification accuracy results indicate that the Sentinel-1 SAR is a useful alternative imagery source particularly in regions with persistent cloud cover.

AB  - Agricultural flood monitoring is important for food security and economic stability. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the advantage over optical data by operating at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover or a lack of illumination. This characteristic makes SAR a potential alternative to optical sensors for agricultural flood monitoring during disasters. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of using freely available Copernicus Sentinel-1 SAR data for operational agricultural flood monitoring in the United States (U.S.). The operational detection of flood inundation was tested during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which resulted in significant flooding over Texas and Louisiana, U. S. This paper presents 1) the agricultural flood monitoring method that utilizes Sentinel-1 SAR, the NASS 2016 Cultivated Layer, and the NASS 2016 and 2017 Cropland Data Layers; 2) flood detection validation results and 3) inundated cropland and pasture acreage estimates. The study shows that Sentinel-1 SAR is an effective and valuable data source for operational disaster assessment of agriculture.

It has focussed political power on the executive and declared the governing party to be the only legitimate representative of the will of the people. The government has an instrumental understanding of law and constitutional law, and regards its success in the elections as a justification for assuming sweeping powers. It is creating a permanent state of emergency, with elections in particular being held in an atmosphere of alleged threats from domestic and foreign enemies. The worldview and politics of the government are illiberal and anti-pluralist.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Over the last three decades, the field of genetic cardiac arrhythmia diseases has transformed to where genetic testing has become an integral part of diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, including family evaluation. In fact, in some cases these genetic discoveries have enabled pre-clinical diagnosis thereby possibly preventing one of its most devastating, and sometimes sentinel, event of sudden cardiac death (SCD). This is certainly true for the cardiac channelopathies, heritable cardiac arrhythmia syndromes caused by abnormal ion channel function clinically leading to syncope, seizures, and SCD, often in the setting of a structurally normal heart. These inherited and potentially lethal arrhythmia disorders include a variety of diseases, of which the most common ones-long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)-will be discussed in this chapter. As will be outlined, not only can genetics help (or complicate) diagnosis of these channelopathies, important genotype-phenotype correlations have emerged that might aid in risk stratification for these conditions, and genotype specific therapies are available in certain situations.

AB  - Timely and accurate information on crop growth and seasonal dynamics are increasingly needed to develop monitoring systems aimed to detect seasonal anomalies, support site specific management and estimate crop yield at the end of the season. In particular, frequent decametric information nowadays being provided exploiting the new generation of Earth Observation (EO) platforms are fundamental for farm level monitoring. This study presents an analysis aimed at fully exploiting dense time series of EO data derived from the combined use of ESA Sentinel-2A and NASA Landsat-7/8 imageries for crop phenological monitoring. Decametric Leaf Area Index (LAI) maps were generated for the year 2016 by inversion of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model with Gaussian process regression for a study area located in northern of Italy, and used to derive rice crop stages information by exploiting an adaptation of phenological algorithm. Preliminary results showed that occurrence of the main crop development stages can be estimated at parcel level with reasonable accuracy (7 to 15 days mean error depending on the phenological phase) and phenometrics analysis provide information in agreement with the different cultivated varieties and adopted agro-management practices.

AB  - Satellite and airborne remote sensing results are shown and indicate the need for continued development of simultaneous use of sensors systems on the same platform, simultaneously collecting imagery at different spectral and spatial resolutions. When multiresolution imagery is collected simultaneously, high quality spatial and spectral image fusion techniques can be applied to the different sensor field of views that helps to improve detection of earth surface features and targets. Multispectral imagery fused with hyperspectral imagery described and results shown in this paper indicates the ability to detect subsurface water features along Florida littoral zones and coastal water regions. The use of multiresolution imaging from the same remote sensing platform provides a valuable approach for detecting sun glint regions and reflectance due to water wave facets and the presence of breaking waves. In littoral regions along Space Coast Florida and the Indian River Lagoon, surface bidirectional reflectance increases 5-6 times the background water surface reflectance, making typical water column constituent estimation questionable. The detection of the influence of surface water gravity waves can be modeled or easily detected using ground sampling distances or spatial resolutions less than or near 0.3 m. Spatial resolutions of approximately one meter or greater do not allow suitable detection of pixels affected by water waves. Satellite imagery based directional reflectance using ground sampling distance greater than 1 meter is contaminated by water wave facet reflection, breaking waves and sun glint effects. Thus bio-geophysical variables such as chlorophyll pigments, suspended matter, dissolved organic matter and light attenuation depths are biased. This bias effect can only be estimated reliably by using small spatial resolution imagery with knowledge gained from analytical and Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling and multiresolution fused imagery. Application of transferable remote sensing algorithms for water quality applications require bidirectional reflectance corrections for water waves, sun glint, and wave facet effects. Example high quality WorldView-3 multispectral and panchromatic clearly shows the water wave facet reflectance effects that is imbedded into larger GSD imagery of water regions and littoral zones and as shown in hyperspectral Monte Carlo model results.

AB  - Hyperspectral in-situ attenuation measurements have been conducted within the Indian River and Palm Bay estuaries. Station data is used to help assess the light attenuation depths obtained from satellite imagery such as WorldView-3. Measurements made during 2016-2018 suggest that optimal photosynthetic light needed for submerged plant species may not be available or optimal plant growth. The attenuation data indicates that in the estuarine waters influenced by dissolved organic matter, gelbstoff, and suspended particulates and seston, only the red portion of the light spectrum reaches deeper waters. In these waters, submerged vegetation are not present but underwater videos shows the eater bottom is readily visible except during high wind and wave events that resuspend bottom boundary layer mud and muck sediments. The measurements of water attenuation is also affected by water wave facet reflectance as shown by Monte Caro model results.

AB  - This paper reports a study of how vegetation affects the formation of an Oasis Cool Island (OCI) in a dry climate, and aims to quantify the effectiveness of the oasis structure on the cooling effect by acomparative analysis of two oasis models: traditional oasis and modern oasis. The Landsat8 data of the hottest summer day was required, treated and analysed. In addition, all palm groves were classed and mapped using the ArcGIS 10.2 platform. Our results show that the traditional oasis has the lowest values of Land Surface Temperature (LST) which generates a strong cooling intensity (OCI=-7.95 degrees C). Furthermore, the study suggests that Planting Density (PD) is a determining factor of OCI rather than the size of vegetation cover. Thus, the study provides information for urban planners seeking to create afavourable microclimate through vegetation management.

AB  - Dennett's latest book is full of infectious ideas that are jostling for the reader's attention, almost leaping from the page, intent on nestling in his or her hapless brain. Or is it? In this paper, I discuss the usefulness of the meme's eye view to understand culture. After rejecting the worldview called "panmemetics", I try to resolve an ambiguity in the literature on cultural evolution by asking the cui malo? question: who or what is being harmed when we say that some meme is "parasitical"? I then address a Millikan' challenge, in order to strengthen Dennett's account of memes. Finally, I briefly discuss why certain irrational belief systems (e.g. witchcraft beliefs in early modern Europe) are prime examples of cultural parasitism.

AB  - This paper proposes a method of denoising SAR images, using a deep learning method, which takes advantage of the abundance of data to learn on large stacks of images of the same scene. The approach is based on the use of convolutional networks, used as auto-encoders. Learning is led on a large pile of images acquired on the same area, and assumes that the images of this stack differ only by the speckle noise. Several pairs of images are chosen randomly in the stack, and the network tries to predict the slave image from the master image. In this prediction, the network can not predict the noise because of its random nature. Also the application of this network to a new image fulfills the speckle filtering function. Results are given on Sentinel 1 images. They show that this approach is qualitatively competitive with literature.

AB  - EvapoTranspiration (ET) is an important component of the water cycle, especially in semi-arid lands. Its quantification is crucial for a sustainable management of scarce water resources. A way to quantify ET is to exploit the available surface temperature data from remote sensing as a signature of the surface energy balance, including the latent heat flux. Remotely sensed energy balance models enable to estimate stress levels and, in turn, the water status of most continental surfaces. The evaporation and transpiration components of ET are also just as important in agricultural water management and ecosystem health monitoring. Single temperatures can be used with dual source energy balance models but rely on specific assumptions on raw levels of plant water stress to get both components out of a single source of information. Additional information from remote sensing data are thus required, either something specifically related to evaporation (such as surface water content) or transpiration (such as PRI or fluorescence). This works evaluates the SPARSE dual source energy balance model ability to compute not only total ET, but also water stress and transpiration/evaporation components. First, the theoretical limits of the ET component retrieval are assessed through a simulation experiment using both retrieval and prescribed modes of SPARSE with the sole surface temperature. A similar work is performed with an additional constraint, the topsoil surface soil moisture level, showing the significant improvement on the retrieval. Then, a flux dataset acquired over rainfed wheat is used to check the robustness of both stress levels and ET retrievals. In particular, retrieval of the evaporation and transpiration components is assessed in both conditions (forcing by the sole temperature or the combination of temperature and soil moisture). In our example, there is no significant difference in the performance of the total ET retrieval, since the evaporation rate retrieved from the sole surface temperature is already fairly close to the one we can reconstruct from observed surface soil moisture time series, but current work is underway to test it over other plots.

AB  - We combine Landsat and MODIS data with the CIESIN population products to generate observation-based maps characterizing past (2001) and near-present (2011) land use change in the continental United States (CONUS) with emphasis on urban development characterized by impervious surface area (ISA).At city-scale urbanization appears to implicitly include a 'cultural character' whereby depending on the region, cities are either built horizontally using large ISA per capita or becoming denser and possibly using vertical structures with small spatial footprints. This 'cultural character' is modulated by land availability, topography, coastlines proximity and land use policy regulation.Regionally, the largest population and ISA change between 2001 and 2011 occurred in the South, while the most noticeable ISA per capita increases are observed in urban centers of the South and Midwest. The South has the highest population and population change, the greatest ISA extent and ISA change, while the Midwest is characterized by the highest per capita ISA use. All regions show an increase in ISA per capita during the decade except for the West which showed a decline.Overall, by 2011 urbanization has sprawled 11% relative to 2001, and ISA per capita use decreases as cities' size increases.

AB  - This work is devoted to the study and analysis of the Eastern Anti-Atlass drainage networks, its characteristics, distribution and arrangement in relation with geological and geomorphological nature of this area. Its a multi-source approach based on several types of data, including Landsat 8 satellite imagery and 30 meters resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generated from Terra-Aster images, allowing the identification and mapping of geological structures and the automatic extraction of the drainage network. Data processing in GIS allowed to extract several density thresholds of drainage network in order to identify the most representative one to the climate and surface of the study area. The analyzes were carried out on the distribution of the drainage network and faults density, the different drainage patterns and their rose diagrams of directions.

AB  - The surface soil moisture is a key parameter that describes and conditions the exchange between the surface and the atmosphere via the energy balance. It is important because of its impact on the evapotranspiration and irrigation management. The most widespread approach is based on the synergy between radar and optical data to retrieve soil moisture. The aim is to study the potential of Sentinel sensors (Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2)) for the retrieving of the soil moisture at regional scale. First, an analysis between the radar (S-1) and the measured data (soil moisture, soil roughness and Leaf Area Index (LAI)) is established over bare soils and cereal fields in the Kairouan plain, Tunisia. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the radar signal in VV (vertical) polarization and soil and vegetation parameters are strongly correlated than in VH cross polarization. The Water Cloud Model was calibrated using the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) retrieved from Sentinel-2 images. Then, an inversion approach of this model is developed for the mapping of soil moisture at high spatial resolution.

AB  - The present work is a combined study of gravity and Sentine-1 data for fracture mapping in the karstic massif of Beni Mellal Atlas and the adjacent plain of Beni Moussa. In order to locate the various faults that contribute to the study area structuring, the gravimetric contacts analysis method, based on the joint use of the horizontal gradient and the upward continuation at different altitudes, has been applied to the gravity data. To optimize the structural mapping in the study area, the gravimetric lineaments obtained were completed and correlated with the lineaments got from Sentinel-1 image. Four faults families of NE-SW; E-O; N-S and NWSE directions have been highlighted There fault families are perfectly combined with the studied area's surface water network, moreover, they corroborate with the previous geological and structural studies.

AB  - With the current deployment of high throughput satellite (HTS) providing several gigabits of capacity in multiple spot beams, satellite networks may ultimately play a significant role in the 5G landscape. This trend is supported by several initiatives starting with two study items at the 3GPP. Although not central at the time being, the question of defining a new waveform for satellite may come at the forefront in the near future. With power fluctuations similar to those of single carrier (SC) waveforms, the discrete Fourier transform-spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) modulation appears as a relevant candidate for such a waveform. Despite its strong advantages, DFT-s-OFDM still lacks of reference signals (RS) combining low power fluctuations with low pilot overhead. In this paper, we propose a new pilot scheme where reference samples are introduced prior to DFT in front of information data. The overall symbol is generated after cancellation of the data contribution onto the pilot samples and the insertion of a cyclic prefix (CP) related to the pilot part. Doing so, the channel can be estimated from the first samples of the pilot symbol used as a known short OFDM symbol. Performance evaluations assess the relevance of the proposed scheme, especially for satellite contexts.

TI  - Unintended Consequences? The Commodification of Ideas in Tertiary Education and their Effects on Muslim Students
T2  - INTELLECTUAL DISCOURSE
M3  - Article
AB  - Islamic education, from a holistic point of view, is more than just the direct transmission of the pure Islamic sciences. It encompasses other branches of specialisation and ideally accompanies Muslims, through reflections of the Islamic worldview, during their formal and informal formation. This paper reflects how, in the contemporary tertiary education in the Islamic world, commodified concepts stemming from a non-Islamic worldview are being proliferated, and what the expected results are for Muslim students. The paper expounds on differences in worldview and educational systems and the commodification of ideas. It gives examples from business school curricula, psychology and the impact of teaching in a foreign language, to summarise (un)intended consequences on the students' educational developments. It also shows how the agency of the theory of Maqasid, the higher objectives of Islamic law, has immersed Islamic thought in reaction to the bias in the educational system.

AB  - As part of the Copernicus programme of the European Commission (EC), the European Space Agency (ESA) operates the Sentinel-2 mission that acquires high spatial resolution optical imagery. The consistency of the image time series is ensured by some specific performance requirements such as multi-temporal spatial registration and radiometric stability, routinely monitored by the Sentinel-2 Mission Performance Centre (S2MPC). The products also provide a rich set of metadata and auxiliary data to support high-level processing activities. This presentation provides a description of the main level-1 products calibration and validation activities, performed by the S2MPC including several Expert Support Laboratories (ESL). Measured performances and analysed results show the good quality of the mission products both in terms of radiometry and geometry. The current performances for Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B are compared to mission product quality requirements.

AB  - Indonesia is periodically affected by severe volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, which are geologically coupled to the convergence of the Australian tectonic plate beneath the Sunda Plate. Multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MTI) can be used to support studying and modelling of terrain movements. This work is aimed at performing an analysis of ground displacements over Indonesian sites through MTI techniques. Two test sites in Sumatra and Java have been selected according to the availability of archived SAR data, GNSS networks, and geological data. Both COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and Senitnel-1 data-sets have been processed through MTI algorithms. The derived displacement maps have been interpreted according to the available geological and geophysical information.

TI  - Particulate Matter Air Pollution and the Risk of Incident CKD and Progression to ESRD
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Elevated levels of fine particulate matter <2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes and death, but their association with risk of CKD and ESRD is unknown. We linked the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Veterans Affairs databases to build an observational cohort of 2,482,737 United States veterans, and used survival models to evaluate the association of PM2.5 concentrations and risk of incident eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), incident CKD, eGFR decline >= 30%, and ESRD over a median follow-up of 8.52 years. County-level exposure was defined at baseline as the annual average PM2.5 concentrations in 2004, and separately as time-varying where it was updated annually and as cohort participants moved. In analyses of baseline exposure (median, 11.8 [interquartile range, 10.1-13.7] mu g/m(3)), a 10-mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with increased risk of eGFR, 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.14 to 1.29), CKD(HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.38), eGFR decline >= 30%(HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.39), and ESRD (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.35). In time-varying analyses, a 10-mg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with similarly increased risk of eGFR, 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), CKD, eGFR decline >= 30%, and ESRD. Spline analyses showed a linear relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and risk of kidney outcomes. Exposure estimates derived from National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite data yielded consistent results. Our findings demonstrate a significant association between exposure to PM2.5 and risk of incident CKD, eGFR decline, and ESRD.

AB  - The US and nations of the NATO Alliance are increasingly threatened by the global spread of terrorism, humanitarian crises/disaster response, and public health emergencies. These threats are influenced by the unprecedented rise of information sharing technologies and practices, where mobile access to social networking sites is ubiquitous. In this new information environment, agile data algorithms, machine learning software, and threat alert mechanisms must be developed to automatically create alerts and drive quick response. US science and technology investments in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) and Human Agent Teaming (HAT) are increasingly focused on developing capabilities toward that end. A critical foundation of these technologies is the awareness of the underlying context to accurately interpret machine-processed warnings and recommendations. In this sense, context can be a dynamic characteristic of the operating environment and demands a multi-analytic approach In this paper, we describe US doctrine that formulates capability requirements for operations in the information environment. We then describe a promising social computing approach that brings together information retrieval strategies using multimedia sources that include text, video, and imagery. Social computing is used in this case to increase awareness of societal dynamics at various scales that influence and impact military operations in both the physical and information domains Our focus, content based information retrieval and multimedia analytics, involves the exploitation of multiple data sources to deliver timely and accurate synopses of data that can be combined with human intuition and understanding to develop a comprehensive worldview.

TI  - Fusing MODIS with Landsat 8 data to downscale weekly normalized difference vegetation index estimates for central Great Basin rangelands, USA
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data fused from distinct but complementary satellite sensors mitigate tradeoffs that researchers make when selecting between spatial and temporal resolutions of remotely sensed data. We integrated data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor aboard the Terra satellite and the Operational Land Imager sensor aboard the Landsat 8 satellite into four regression-tree models and applied those data to a mapping application. This application produced downscaled maps that utilize the 30-m spatial resolution of Landsat in conjunction with daily acquisitions of MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) that are composited and temporally smoothed. We produced four weekly, atmospherically corrected, and nearly cloud-free, downscaled 30-m synthetic MODIS NDVI predictions (maps) built from these models. Model results were strong with R-2 values ranging from 0.74 to 0.85. The correlation coefficients (r0.89) were strong for all predictions when compared to corresponding original MODIS NDVI data. Downscaled products incorporated into independently developed sagebrush ecosystem models yielded mixed results. The visual quality of the downscaled 30-m synthetic MODIS NDVI predictions were remarkable when compared to the original 250-m MODIS NDVI. These 30-m maps improve knowledge of dynamic rangeland seasonal processes in the central Great Basin, United States, and provide land managers improved resource maps.

TI  - Estimating carbon and showing impacts of drought using satellite data in regression-tree models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating spatially explicit biogeophysical and remotely sensed data into regression-tree models enables the spatial extrapolation of training data over large geographic spaces, allowing a better understanding of broad-scale ecosystem processes. The current study presents annual gross primary production (GPP) and annual ecosystem respiration (RE) for 2000-2013 in several short-statured vegetation types using carbon flux data from towers that are located strategically across the conterminous United States (CONUS). We calculate carbon fluxes (annual net ecosystem production [NEP]) for each year in our study period, which includes 2012 when drought and higher-than-normal temperatures influence vegetation productivity in large parts of the study area. We present and analyse carbon flux dynamics in the CONUS to better understand how drought affects GPP, RE, and NEP. Model accuracy metrics show strong correlation coefficients (r) (r94%) between training and estimated data for both GPP and RE. Overall, average annual GPP, RE, and NEP are relatively constant throughout the study period except during 2012 when almost 60% less carbon is sequestered than normal. These results allow us to conclude that this modelling method effectively estimates carbon dynamics through time and allows the exploration of impacts of meteorological anomalies and vegetation types on carbon dynamics.

AB  - This release includes a number changes. Most importantly it fixes a problem with building extents of image subsets in the msswarp function. The issue is tied to the R raster library version. Something in the raster::extent function has changed between raster version 2.5-8 and 2.6-7. The LLR code with swapping the order of min and max y coordinates, but older versions of raster::extent was dealing with this by first sorting the inputs by ascending order - for some methods of raster::extent, it is no longer doing this, which was throwing an error. The problem in the msswarp function is now fixed. msswarp is also improved by trying to find image-to-image tie points at three different window sizes, where previously it only used 1. This update is also more intelligent about knowing when to use 2 cores for parallel processing by checking on the available system memory. Also, there is now better handling of incorrect processing directory selection - the program tries to figure out if you've provided a valid processing directory and returns messages about possible problems with the selection.

TI  - Opposing Roles of Dendritic Cell Subsets in Experimental GN
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are thought to form a dendritic network across barrier surfaces and throughout organs, including the kidney, to perform an important sentinel function. However, previous studies of DC function used markers, such as CD11c or CX3CR1, that are not unique to DCs. Here, we evaluated the role of DCs in renal inflammation using a CD11c reporter mouse line and two mouse lines with DC-specific reporters, Zbtb46-GFP and Snx22-GFP. Multiphoton microscopy of kidney sections confirmed that most of the dendritically shaped CD11c(+) cells forming a network throughout the renal interstitium expressed macrophage-specific markers. In contrast, DCs marked by Zbtb46-GFP or Snx22-GFP were less abundant, concentrated around blood vessels, and round in shape. We confirmed this pattern of localization using imaging mass cytometry. Motility measurements showed that resident macrophages were sessile, whereas DCs were motile before and after inflammation. Although uninflamed glomeruli rarely contained DCs, injury with nephrotoxic antibodies resulted in accumulation of ZBTB46(+) cells in the periglomerular region. ZBTB46 identifies all classic DCs, which can be categorized into two functional subsets that express either CD103 or CD11b. Depletion of ZBTB46(+) cells attenuated the antibody-induced kidney injury, whereas deficiency of the CD103(+) subset accelerated injury through a mechanism that involved increased neutrophil infiltration. RNA sequencing 7 days after nephrotoxic antibody injection showed that CD11b(+) DCs expressed the neutrophil-attracting cytokine CXCL2, whereas CD103(+) DCs expressed high levels of several anti-inflammatory genes. These results provide new insights into the distinct functions of the two major DC subsets in glomerular inflammation.

AB  - Most ecological studies of the effects of climate on species are based on average conditions above ground level (measured by meteorological stations) averaged across 100 km(2) or larger areas. However, most terrestrial organisms experience conditions in a much smaller area at the ground surface or within vegetation canopies, the climate of which can be very different to large-scale averages. Therefore, to accurately characterise the climatic conditions suitable for species, it is essential to include microclimate information. Microclimates are affected by the shape of the landscape, including the steepness and aspect of slopes, height above sea level, proximity to the sea or inland water, and whether a site is in a valley or at the top of a hill. Plants also modify the conditions found within or below their canopies, with the structure of vegetation playing an important role. The recent increase in the availability ofmicrosensors and remotely sensed data at appropriate resolutions has led some ecologists to begin to includemicroclimate information within a variety of contexts; however the field can be confusing and intimidating and mistakes are often made along the way. In this chapter, we provide an overview of microclimatic processes and summarise the available methods of measuring and modelling microclimate data for incorporation in ecological research. We highlight pitfalls to avoid emerging novel methods and the limitations of some techniques. We also consider future research directions and opportunities within this emerging field.

TI  - Evaluation of atmospheric correction and high-resolution processing on SeaDAS-derived chlorophyll-<i>a</i>: an example from mid-latitude mesotrophic waters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last 15years, great effort has gone into the development of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) retrieval algorithms for case 2 waters, where variations in the water leaving radiance signal are not well correlated with concentrations of chl-a. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived chl-a retrieval algorithms in the less productive coastal waters around Tasmania, Australia. Algorithms were evaluated using matches between satellite imagery and in-situ water samples (number of samples, n=16-65) derived from a 604 sample data set collected over a 9-year period. Three aerosol correction models and three chl-a retrieval algorithms were evaluated using both standard and high-resolution processing procedures using the National Aeronatics and Space Adminstration's SeaDAS software package. chl-a retrievals were evaluated in Bass Strait, where in-situ chl-a was less than 1mgm(-3) and retrievals were less affected by coloured dissolved organic matter. chlor_a, the default SeaDAS chl-a product, with the Management unit of the North Sea Mathematical models aerosol correction algorithm performed best (root mean square error (RMSE)=0.09mgm(-3); mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)=34%; coefficient of determination, R-2=0.75). The fluorescence line height algorithm using Rayleigh corrected top of atmosphere reflectances (RMSE=0.11mgm(-3), MAPE=41%, R-2=0.61) may provide an alternative in waters where full atmospheric correction is problematic and the two-band red/near-infrared algorithm failed to provide a meaningful estimate of chl-a. High-resolution processing of MODIS imagery improved spatial resolution but reduced chl-a retrieval accuracy, reducing the agreement between measured and predicted levels by between 12% and 25% depending on the retrieval algorithm. The SeaDAS default chlor_a product proved superior to the alternatives in mid-latitude mesotrophic coastal waters with low chl-a concentrations. In addition, there appears little benefit in using MODIS high-resolution processing mode for chl-a retrievals.

AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to describe the pathologic findings and early follow-up experience of patients who underwent a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) between 2008 and 2017.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of women with breast cancer who underwent an SLNB at AKUH between 2008 and 2017. The SLNB was performed on patients with stage I and stage II breast cancer, and identification of the sentinel lymph node was made by radioactive tracer, blue dye, or both, per availability and surgeon preference. Demographic, surgical, and pathologic data, including immunohistochemistry of the surgical sample for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, were abstracted from the patient records. Follow-up data were available for a subset of patients.RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2017, six surgeons performed SLNBs on 138 women, 129 of whom had complete records and were included in the study. Thirty-one of 129 (24%) had a positive SLNB, including 10 of 73 (14%) with stage I and 21 of 56 (38%) with stage II disease. Seventy-eight patients (60%) received systemic adjuvant chemotherapy and 79 (62%) received radiation therapy, and of the 102 patients who were estrogen receptor positive, 86 (85%) received endocrine therapy. Seventy-nine patients were observed for > 2 years, and, of these, four (5.1%) had a regional recurrence.CONCLUSION: The SLNB positivity rates were similar to those of high-income country (HIC) cohorts. However, preliminary data suggest that recurrence rates are elevated at AKUH as compared with those of HIC cohorts, perhaps because of a lower use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy at AKUH compared with HIC cohorts or because of differences in the characteristics of the primary tumor in patients at AKUH as compared with those in HICs.

TI  - Therapeutic targets for inflammation-mediated airway remodeling in chronic lung disease
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Acute exacerbations of chronic lung disease account for substantial morbidity and health costs. Repeated inflammatory episodes and attendant bronchoconstriction cause structural remodeling of the airway. Remodeling is a multicellular response to mucosal injury that results in epithelial cell-state changes, enhanced extracellular deposition, and expansion of pro-fibrotic myofibroblast populations.Areas covered: This manuscript overviews mechanistic studies identifying key sentinel cell populations in the airway and how pattern recognition signaling induces maladaptive mucosal changes and airway remodeling. Studies elucidating how NFB couples with an atypical histone acetyltransferase, bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) that reprograms mucosal fibrogenic responses, are described. The approaches to development and characterization of selective inhibitors of epigenetic reprogramming on innate inflammation and structural remodeling in preclinical models are detailed.Expert commentary: Bronchiolar cells derived from Scgb1a1-expressing progenitors function as major sentinel cells of the airway, responsible for initiating antiviral and aeroallergen responses. In these sentinel cells, activation of innate inflammation is coupled to neutrophilic recruitment, mesenchymal transition and myofibroblast expansion. Therapeutics targeting the NFkB-BRD4 may be efficacious in reducing pathological effects of acute exacerbations in chronic lung disease.

TI  - The Status of the Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (3Pn, 4RS) Cod Stock (Gadus morhua) in 2016.
T2  - Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Research Document
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of the cod (Gadus morhua) stock of the Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (NAFO 3Pn, 4RS) is based on data from commercial fisheries, a tagging program, an abundance index calculated from the DFO research survey, abundance indices from the fixed gear sentinel fisheries program (longlines and gillnets), an abundance index from the mobile gear sentinel fisheries program and biological data. This document describes the data and methods used to assess several indicators including abundance, biomass, spawning biomass, natural mortality, exploitation rate and recruitment. It also includes a prediction of the stock trends until 2019. The cod stock of the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence remains in the critical zone and well below the limit reference point. The spatial distribution of this stock is now similar to that observed in the 1990s. The exploitation rate is currently low, while natural mortality is high. An annual harvest of 3,000 t for the next two seasons should allow the spawning stock biomass to increase.

AB  - High-Resolution (HR) satellite images are a prerequisite in many applications such as astronomy, remote sensing, geoscience and geographical information systems, not only for providing better visualization but also for extracting extra information details. In the present work a comparative study of different single image resolution enhancement techniques is carried out on Sentinel-2 images of bands B2, B3, B4 and B8. The authors describe the stochastic regularized super-resolution (SR) reconstruction technique and compare with others. The techniques under comparison are stochastic regularized SR reconstruction (SRSR), spatial-wavelet SR reconstruction (SWSR) and the conventional interpolation techniques nearest neighbor (NN), bilinear (BL), bicubic (BC) and spline (SP). These techniques are tested against each other in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Xydeas and Petrovich (XP), and Correlation Coefficient (CC). Simulated experiments of single image resolution increase take place.

TI  - Estimation of evapotranspiration of temperate grassland based on high-resolution thermal and visible range imagery from unmanned aerial systems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially distributed high-resolution data of land surface temperature (LST) and evapotranspiration (ET) are important information for crop water management and other applications in the agricultural sector. While satellite data can provide LST high-resolution data of 100m, the current development of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and affordable low-weight thermal cameras allows LST and subsequent ET to be derived at resolutions down to centimetre scale.In this study, UAS-based images in the thermal infrared (TIR) and visible spectral range were collected over a managed temperate grassland in July 2016 at the Terrestrial Environmental Observatories Networks TERENO preAlpine observatory site at Fendt, Germany. The UAS set-up included a lightweight thermal camera (Optris Pi Lightweight) and a regular digital camera (Sony 6000) that allowed for the acquisition of thermal and optical images with a ground resolution of 5cm and 1cm, respectively. Three TIR-based ET models of different complexity were applied and the resulting ET estimates were compared to the Eddy covariance (EC) observations of turbulent energy fluxes and also to the evaporative fraction. While the Deriving Atmosphere Turbulent Transport Useful To Dummies Using Temperature (DATTUTDUT)model and the Triangle Method belong to the group of simpler contextual models, the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model incorporates a more physically based formulation of the surface energy balance. In addition to the comparison of UAS-based estimates of latent heat fluxes to EC observations, the effect of the spatial resolution of the model imagery input on the modelled results was analysed by running the models with imagery from the native resolution of the acquired images to resolutions that were aggregated up to 30m.The results show that both contextual models are sensitive to the input image resolution and that the agreement with the EC observations improves with increasing image resolution. The TSEB model assumes that LST pixels represent a mixed signal of the soil and canopy components, thus an image resolution coarse enough to ensure this assumption should be chosen. However, with the exception of the native image resolution of 5cm, we found no effect of image resolution on the spatially weighted mean TSEB estimates.For the studied grassland, the comparison of model estimates with EC observations indicates that all three models are able to reproduce observed energy fluxes with comparable accuracy with mean absolute errors of ET between 20 and 40W m(-2). The TSEB model showed larger deviations from the reference observations under cloudy conditions with rapid fluctuations of LST within the 30 min averaging period for EC. The two contextual models yielded similar results for most of the flights. The good performance of the DATTUTDUT model, which had the lowest input requirements of the three models, is especially promising in view of the application of UAS for routine near-real-time ET monitoring.

TI  - Climatic and Global Validation of Daily MODIS Precipitable Water Data at AERONET Sites for Clear-sky Irradiance Modelling

AB  - Precipitable water (PW) is an influential variable in regards to clear-sky radiation modelling and solar resource assessment. Thus, the accuracy of solar energy estimates depends on the accuracy of PW measurements. Gridded satellite information is commonly used for solar modelling because of its benefit of a broad geographical coverage, thus a global validation of commonly utilised PW products is imperative. Here, all Level-3 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily PW products from the Aqua and Terra satellites (at 1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial resolution) from 01/2000 to 02/2018 are compared and validated against all of NASA's ground-sensing Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) V3 Level-2 PW daily averages from sites that have at least one year of observations during 2000-2018 (452 sites representing 675,158 observations). Furthermore, sub-categorisation by Koppen-Geiger climate regions enables climate specific validation to ascertain any distinct climatic influence. The results demonstrate significant climatological influences that impact the derived PW products. It is found that the Terra PW is more accurate than the Aqua PW, and that blending these two products yields a higher accuracy of daily PW estimates. The MODIS PW product also suffers from overestimation at larger magnitudes (> 3 cm). The absolute errors do not reduce linearly with the PW magnitude, so that relative errors are far worse in areas of low PW, such as the polar climate. The equatorial climate, with the highest PW records, behaves best. Finally, a simple sensitivity test using the REST2 clear-sky radiation model shows that the global PW RMSE (0.511 cm) of the combined MODIS data would result in a 1.5-2.5% under-or overestimate on direct normal irradiance (DNI) depending on latitude relative to using the AERONET mean PW of 1.8971 cm. It is thus concluded that the daily MODIS PW product is not ideal for clear-sky radiation modelling, at least whenever accurate DNI predictions are necessary on a global scale.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The engineering knowledge research program is part of a larger effort to articulate a philosophy of engineering and an engineering worldview. Engineering is not 'merely' applied science. Engineering knowledge requires a more comprehensive conceptual framework than scientific knowledge.The paradigm shift from the limited scientific epistemology to the broader engineering epistemology involves a problem shift. The scientific inquirer seeks the 'facts' of 'objective' reality - out there. The participant engineer, embodied in reality, seeks 'methods' regarding how to work in the world to bring about a more desirable future.The demonstration of complementarity and uncertainty in the new physics established the limits of the classical scientific concept of detached, observer-independent inquiry and knowledge. Quantum uncertainty entails that the inquirer is an active participant in the irreversible historical development of reality. Participant engineering inquiry and knowledge are concerned with 'practical reason'. As Kant pointed out practical reason is about 'how we should live' - the defining question of morality. Participant engineering research and development is concerned with 'the construction of the good.In the design of the modern k12 STEM curriculum it is crucial that developers recognize that the engineering representation of inquiry and knowledge requires a broader conceptual framework than is possible in the scientific representation. Efforts to integrate engineering into liberal arts and sciences colleges have stalled due to a failure to properly understanding of the relationship between engineering and science.The scientific representation of inquiry isn't self-referentially coherent within the deterministic scientific worldview. The engineering representation of embodied inquiry is self-referentially coherent within a progressively emerging reality.

T2  - KNJIZEVNA SMOTRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a reading of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's play Jedermann (The Play of Everyman) as an attempt to seek a literary exit from a sense of fundamental crisis on the eve of the First World War. Unlike the experience of an enfeebled and enervated language; the sick and "unsalvageable" self; and against the menacing erosion of the male hegemony in the relations between the sexes at the turn of the century, one should offer a new, different drama. Both Hofmannsthal's Electra and his Everyman endeavor to satisfy the demand for theatrical revival Electra by returning to the orientalizing, barbaric Greece; Everyman, on the other hand, by referring to the Christian Middle Ages. While Electra shocked the audience with its extreme cruelty, Everyman proved to be a constant success with its conciliatory turn to Christianity in Austrian theater. Its success is due not only to its simple aesthetic means but also to its sociological intelligence, which by reliance on Georg Simmel's The Philosophy of Money and Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class reveals a value orientation aimed exclusively at money, contrary to which stands the Christian thought of the old European worldview.

TI  - A conceptual market framework for water-bound nitrate pollution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion of bottomland hardwood and swamp forests to irrigated agriculture has had problematic consequences for water bodies. Many of these problems can be linked to the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers to increase crop production. To date, there is little monitoring of nitrogen use in watersheds, which may be due to large fixed costs. Using market-based techniques which have addressed previous environmental challenges, with remotely sensed data to track a pollutant's source, may be one alternative, by incentivizing nitrogen users to behave according to abatement costs traced back to the point of origin of a pollutant.

AB  - This paper introduces a new algorithm for denoising SAR images. It is directly applicable to Sentinel-1 GRD images, without the need for single-look complex operations. The algorithm builds on the non-local patch matching idea for statistical denoising, similar to the SAR-BM3D and NL-SAR algorithms, but introduces two corrections : 1. A non-uniform prior for the reflectance values is used for the patch matching, thus allowing a better fit to the data, and 2. Denoising is performed in singular values space, with a prior distribution of expected "clean" singular values learned and transfered from optical images. The denoised SAR images show reduced amount of speckle compared to alternative methods.

TI  - Fine tuning of the SVC method for airborne hyperspectral sensors: the BRDF correction of the calibration nets targets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents measurements of the azimuth and zenith angle-dependence of the targets that are used for supervised vicarious calibration (SVC) methodology of hyperspectral sensors. Surface radiance measure at sensor from airborne instruments, such as the AisaDUAL and HyMap sensors, show an apparent noise and shift that limit the information content and even impair the collected data (after removing the atmospheric attenuation). The drift from actual radiance is contributed by various sources; e.g., atmospheric gases and aerosols, and sensor stability. Yet one of the major contributors to it during nadir scanning is the directional effect of target reflectance at variable illumination geometry, also known as Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). The SVC method, which is based on ground dark nets of varying densities, was able to correct for the above factors and recalibrate the sensor's radiance during data acquisition. The main assumption of the SVC method is that the net targets are a Lambertian surface. In this paper, the BRDF measurements of the SVC net targets were carried out using a goniometer and controlled laboratory conditions. These measurements revealed anisotropic properties of the nets targets, which were further introduced to the radiometric calibration process are significant, especially with the high density nets ( > 50% black net cover). The paper presents a look-up-table of the BRDF correction coefficient factors for each net target (identified and separated by its density and mixing level once placed over a bright background) at various zenith (from 10 to 30) and azimuth (from 0 degrees to 360 at intervals of 10) angles. The coefficients were calculated for the near infrared spectral region (at 981 nm), and should be applied to the full-reflected spectral range across visible, near and shortwave-infrared wavelengths (400-2500 nm). The acquired results in this empirical study showed that the SVC calibration nets targets are characterized by incoherent BRDF effect. The darker and denser calibration targets absorb the down welling radiance, and thus, reduce the amount of intermediate multiple scattering, normally accrued in all other (less dense) examined targets. The impact of target density on the BRDF correction coefficient and its dependence with illumination zenith and azimuth angles is studied and presented. The correction coefficient factors obtained in the laboratory were implemented in two real airborne hyperspectral campaigns of two different sensors: AisaDUAL and HyMAP over the same calibration site. The proposed BRDF SVC net corrections enables fine-tuning of the vicarious calibration procedure, while increasing the quality of the radiometric data. Thus, it is recommended to use the BRDF coefficients obtained in this paper for any airborne hyperspectral sensor that uses the SVC method in order to achieve better calibration accuracy.

AB  - Continuity to the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) will be provided by the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Insfrument (OLCI), and to ensure its utility in a wide range of operational applications, validation efforts are required. In the past, these activities have been constrained by the need for costly airborne hyperspecfral data acquisition, but the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Insfrument (MSI) now offers a promising alternative. In this paper, we explore the synergetic use of Sentinel-2 MSI data for validation of the Sentinel-3 OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI) over the Valencia Anchor Station, a large agricultural site in the Valencian Community, Spain. High retrieval accuracy (RMSE = 0.20 g m(-2)) was obtained by applying machine learning techniques to Sentinel-2 MSI data, highlighting the valuable information it can provide when used in synergy with Sentinel-3 OLCI data for land product validation.

TI  - Epistemic divides and ontological confusions: The psychology of vaccine scepticism
T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vaccine scepticism is an increasingly important barrier to optimal coverage in developed countries. In this commentary, we make the case that negative attitudes towards vaccines reflect a broader and deeper set of beliefs about health and wellbeing. We suggest that this alternative worldview is influenced by ontological confusions (e.g. regarding purity, natural energy), and knowledge based on personal lived experience and trusted peers, rather than the positivist epistemological framework. Our view is supported by recent social-psychological research, including strong correlations of vaccine scepticism with adherence to complementary and alternative medicine, magical health beliefs, and conspiracy ideation. For certain well-educated and well-resourced individuals, opposition to vaccines represents an expression of personal intuition and agency, in achieving a positive and life-affirming approach to health and wellbeing. These core beliefs are not amenable to change - and especially resistant to communications from orthodox, authoritative sources. Although this view does suggest tactical improvements to messaging, we suggest that a better long-term strategy is to combine with other disciplines in order to address the root causes of vaccine scepticism. Vaccine scepticism is unlikely to thrive in a cultural context that trusts and values the scientific consensus.

AB  - In the last years it has been progressively invested many efforts in the cultural heritage digitization: surveying, modeling activities, diagnostic analysis and historic data collection of architectural heritage. Such actions have been mainly acquired for the preservation process, during the restoration and construction site. Unfortunately, many of them are left abandoned in a latent status without any connection with the long life cycle of the historic architectures or connection to the dissemination. The paper presents the case of an informative model for the Basilica di Collemaggio generated on high resolution surveying (laser scanning, photogrammetric point clouds and IRT Infrared Thermography) to manage the knowledge acquired on the geometry and the collected information on materials, construction technology and decay analysis for the design and conservation after the earthquake occurred at L'Aquila. The paper illustrates the HBIM (Heritage Building Information Model) achieved to support the restoration process funded by EniServizi within the project `Restart from Collemaggio'. It is described the generative modelling process implemented to embody the complexity and specificity of the morphology related to the collected information on the state of the art, the sum of the current damages and transformations during the centuries, for the preservation plan of the monument. Many damaged structures as in the case of the north wall with the Holy Door and of the arched naves with the ancient pillars have been restored preserving the maximum level of authenticity of the materials and construction techniques. The HBIM of the Basilica, re-opened to the public on December 2017, is ready to a sentinel role among past present and future.

AB  - It was the objective of this work to develop a procedure for the relative radiometric normalization of Sentinel-2 images and to verify its applicability in the modeling of chlorophyll-a concentration based on satellite data. A process of analyzing changes for the selection of pseudo-invariant surfaces has been proposed. These pseudo-invariant surfaces were used in a newly developed spatially variable variant of relative radiometric normalization. The satellite data already corrected by the Sen2Cor program were additionally corrected by the proposed procedure. Models were developed to calculate the concentration of chlorophyll-a from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Models based on unmodified and radiometrically normalized satellite data were compared. The positive effect of the proposed procedure on the chlorophyll-a model was proven.

AB  - The continuous monitoring of coastal areas is a necessary condition for a timely assessment of shoreline erosion phenomena. The traditional approach consists in ground investigations that are impractical in terms of costs and logistics, on a national or even regional scale. Earth Observation (EO) techniques can represent a cost-effective alternative for a wide scale Coastal Zone Management. Thanks to the all-weather day/night radar imaging capability and to the nationwide acquisition plan named Mapltaly, devised by the Italian Space Agency and active since 2010, COSMO-SkyMed constellation is able to provide X-band images covering the Italian territory with a best effort revisit time of 16 days. However, any remote sensing approach must be accurately calibrated and corrected for the actual meteo-marine conditions. Therefore, in situ data are essential for proper EO data selection, tidal corrections and validation of EO products. An integrated semi-automatic technique for coastal risk assessment and monitoring, named COSMO-Beach, is presented here, with a particular emphasis on the ground truths provided in input to the implemented processing chain, as well as its application on two different test sites in Apulia Region (South Italy).

T2  - DIGITAL GEOARCHAEOLOGY: NEW TECHNIQUES FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY HUMAN-ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Due to today's broad and often free availability of detailed satellite data, it became possible to examine desert areas on a large scale and, ideally, down to tiny details for old trans-Saharan route systems, which are abandoned since centuries or even thousands of years ago. Additionally, digital elevation models (DEMs) can be used to evaluate the geomorphological situation. In conjunction with historical sources and ground-truth data, these data allow us to reconstruct the position of the desert routes with reasonable accuracy, here exemplified for the Western Desert of Egypt. On the central limestone plateau, where stony ground (hamada, serir) prevails, most of the routes can precisely been seen from space because of their specific natural preservation conditions. In contrast, sandy surfaces usually do not allow recognition of routes in the satellite image. Additionally, the quite narrow donkey tracks of the pharaonic routes are mostly invisible from space. On the other hand, DEMs (ASTER, SRTM) allow calculating ideal routes by means of geographical information systems (GIS), usually applied in cases were traditional routes have not survived. In the present study, we confront both methods using the example of the Darb el-Tawil to test the hypothesis that these old roads largely follow the ideal route. This 250 km long road has been one of the primary arteries between the Nile Valley and theWestern Desert oases during the past 4000 years. Due to modern demographic and economic development, it has been selected for the construction of a new paved highway, which will irrevocably destroy the still existing tracks and archaeological objects.

CL  - Klaipeda, LITHUANIA
AB  - The goal of the study is to examine spatial and temporal variability of total suspended matter (TSM) concentration in the surface layer of the South-eastern Baltic (SEB) based on satellite and in situ data. The TSM concentration was estimated from in situ measurements and MODIS-Aqua satellite data for 2003-2016. The maximum of TSM concentration is located alongside the coast of the Sambia Peninsula (2.5 mg/l). MODIS-derived TSM concentrations demonstrate a precise boundary between higher concentrations of particles in the coastal zone (1-2.5 mg/l) and lower values offshore (less than 1 mg/l) for the whole region during a year. There are three seasonal peaks in TSM values - April, June and August, that is associated with algae blooming. The coastal stations also show October maximum which appears to be owing to storms, forcing the coastal abrasion. Interannual variations of TSM concentration during the observation period are not significant in the offshore area, while considerable interannual variations are typical for the coastal zone. It is obvious that satellite-derived TSM data has benefits due to larger amount of data, but it shows lower annual mean TSM concentrations than in situ data.

AB  - Study Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate the intraoperative and perioperative surgical outcomes of 2 different florescence systems commonly used for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in women with early-stage cervical cancer or endometrial cancer.Design: Case-control study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Setting: The Gynecology Oncology Surgical Unit of the San Gerardo Hospital, Italy.Patients: Thirty-four consecutive women with early stage-cervical cancer (stage IA-1B1) or apparent confined stage I endometrial cancer were included in the study.Interventions: Between October 2016 and May 2017, 34 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery with SLN mapping using indocyanine green dye: 22 women were mapped with the Storz 1S system (Karl Storz Endoscopy, Tuttlingen, Germany; Group A), whereas 12 women underwent planned surgery with the Novadaq PinPoint system (Novadaq, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada; Group B).Measurement and Main Results: We compared the surgical and perioperative outcomes of Group A and Group B. Patients in Group B had a shorter duration of the SLN mapping time than those in Group A (p = .0003). The median number of SLNs removed was 2 (range, 0-5) in Group A and 2 (range, 1-3) in Group B (p = .501). Bilateral mapping was 77.3% in Group A and 83.3% in Group B (p = .334), respectively. No differences were recorded in terms of body mass index, length of hospital stay, type of tumor, bilateral mapping, or number of lymph nodes removed. Body mass index was found to have no impact on the duration of the mapping (p = .353).Conclusion: From our preliminary experience we can conclude that both fluorescence systems are valid and applicable for SLN detection in the case of early-stage cervical or endometrial cancer. The PinPoint system seems to allow surgeons easier and faster identification of the SLNs, particularly in endometrial cancer patients. (c) 2017 AAGL. All rights reserved.

It is concurrent with the growing popularity of minimally invasive surgery; and both are commonly used together. The different kinds of function-preserving gastrectomy included in this review are: pylorus-preserving and proximal gastrectomy, vagus nerve preservation, sentinel node navigation, and various endoscopic & minimally-invasive techniques. In this article the indications, techniques, oncologic safety, functional benefit, and outcomes of each kind of function-preserving gastrectomy are discussed.

AB  - In 2016, the European Unions' Research and Innovation program Horizon 2020 launched the multi-national project called HEritage Resiliance Against CLimatic Events on Site (HERACLES). The goal of this project is to design, validate and promote effective and sustainable solutions against potential threats climatic changes can bring about on the cultural heritage. For this purpose, knowledge and experiences of multiple research facilities and versatile groups of end-users in different European countries will be bundled and synergetically benefited of. In this paper, we will provide an overview about HERACLES project while a particular focus will be put on the activities concerning close-range Remote Sensing data processing. By exploiting image and laser data acquired from UAVs and from the ground, we strive for precise and reliable 3D models that are useful for representation of the scene on the desired level of detail and thus for assessing potential damages and estimating risks. From oblique UAV-borne imagery, we will obtain textured airborne 3D models using photogrammetric methods of image alignment, dense point cloud reconstruction, meshing and texturing. To provide coverage for the objects' interiors, very dense point clouds from terrestrial laser scans can be additionally captured. A triangle mesh is obtained from these points and textured by means of terrestrial high-resolution photos, whereby the registration took place using a point-based method. We identified two main challenges: first, the reconstruction results from high-resolution UAV images were not always satisfying due to a low coverage; to cope with this, extensive interactive corrections must be undertaken. Moreover, seamless merging of triangle meshes provided by aerial photogrammetric reconstruction and by terrestrial laser scans is cumbersome because of varying density and accuracy of 3D points in both meshes.

TI  - Bayesian Cloud Detection for 37 Years of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Area Coverage (GAC) Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is a source of significant errors in retrieval of sea surface temperature (SST). We apply a Bayesian cloud detection scheme to 37 years of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Area Coverage (GAC) data, which is an important source of multi-decadal global SST information. The Bayesian scheme calculates a probability of clear-sky for each image pixel, conditional on the satellite observations and prior probability. We compare the cloud detection performance to the operational Clouds from AVHRR Extended algorithm (CLAVR-x), as a measure of improvement from reduced cloud-related errors. To do this we use sea surface temperature differences between satellite retrievals and in situ observations from drifting buoys and the Global Tropical Moored Buoy Array (GTMBA). The Bayesian scheme reduces the absolute difference between the mean and median SST biases and reduces the standard deviation of the SST differences by similar to 10% for both daytime and nighttime retrievals. These reductions are indicative of removing cloud contaminated outliers in the distribution, as these fall only on one side of the distribution forming a cold tail. At a probability threshold of 0.9 typically used to determine a binary cloud mask for SST retrieval, the Bayesian mask also reduces the robust standard deviation by similar to 5-10% during the day, in comparison with the operational cloud mask. This shows an improvement in the central distribution of SST differences for daytime retrievals.

TI  - EXAMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEATH ANXIETY AND SELF-ESTEEM, RELIGIOUS WORLDVIEWS, PURPOSE IN LIFE
T2  - BILIMNAME
M3  - Article
AB  - Death is an inevitable fact for all living beings. Differently from other living beings, human beings are aware of the reality of death. The subject of this study is examining the relationships between death anxiety and self-esteem, religious worldviews, purpose in life of college students. In this respect, it is assumed that death anxiety has negative relationships with self-esteem, religious worldviews and purpose in life.Living with the reality and inevitability of death is a source of anxiety for human beings (Solomon, et al., 1991). This is explained by Terror Management Theory of Social Psychology. According to this theory, people focus on increasing their self-esteem levels to reduce this anxiety since self-esteem acts as a buffer against possible anxiety caused by the awareness of human mortality (Rosenblatt, et al., 1989). Self -esteem is the attitude of an individual towards him- / herself that also gives information about the individual (Mruk, 2006). Religious worldviews is the belief of an individual in spirituality, supernatural, purpose in life, the existence of another life and the creator (Henze, 2006). Death takes a large part in Islamic religion. It is interpreted not as an annihilation but a transformation (Yildiz, 2014). Religion includes economic, political, social and cultural areas; ethical rules, values and practices that affects all aspects of life (Marshall & van Saanen, 2007). Religion is a worldview and creates a value system (Mehmedoglu, 2013). The purpose in life is described as a feeling that both the present and the past have a meaning (Ryff, 1989). If an individual has no meaning in life and no specific purpose in life, this creates anxiety (Yalom, 1999). The most important goal of an individual is the search for meaning in life which is also the fundamental motivational sources of an individual (Frankl, 2000). The suppression or inhibition of the search for meaning in life creates anxiety (Burrow, et al., 2014).In total of 711 (64.1 % women and 35.9 % men) college students from different departments of a state university in Middle Anatolian region voluntarily participated in this study. Data were collected utilizing Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), Religious Worldviews Scale (Goplen & Plant, 2015), Purpose of Life Scale (Crumbaugh & Maholick, 1964), Death Anxiety Scale (Thorson & Powell, 1992) and personal information form which is developed by the authors of this study. Self -esteem scale was developed by Rosenberg (1965) and adapted to Turkish language by Cuhadaroglu (1986). This scale consists of 10 items. The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient is 0,84 and split -half reliability coefficient is 0,80. The religious worldviews scale was developed by Goplen & Plant (2015) and adapted to Turkish language by Kusat & Bulut (2016). This scale consists of 19 items. The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient is 0,88 and split -half reliability coefficient is 0,86. The purpose of life scale was developed by Crumbaugh & Maholick (1964, 1969) and adapted to Turkish language by Kirac (2015). This scale consists of 16 items. The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient is 0,90 and split -half reliability coefficient is 0,85. The death anxiety scale was developed by Thorson & Powell (1992) and adapted to Turkish language by Karaca & Yildiz (2001). This scale consists of 25 items. The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient is 0,86 and split -half reliability coefficient is 0,83.In analyzing the data, quantitative analyses techniques were used. Means and standard deviations of descriptive statistical techniques were applied. In comparing two independent groups: t-test for independent groups, in comparing more than two groups: variance analysis, in examining the relationships between the variables: correlation analysis and in examining the explained variance in death anxiety: hierarchical regression analysis from inferential statistical techniques were used. Data were analyzed by SPSS 23 statistical package program.According to the findings of this study, in mean scores self-esteem, religious worldviews and purpose in life variables have 'high' and death anxiety has 'medium' score. Independent groups t - test results showed that women's self-esteem, religious worldviews, purpose in life and death anxiety scores are significantly higher than men's scores. ANOVA results showed that there are statistically significant differences in religious worldviews and purpose in life scores between faculties and differences in religious worldviews scores between classes. There are no statistically significant relationships between death anxiety and self-esteem, religious worldviews, purpose in life. Lastly, according to the hierarchical regression analysis results, gender explains the variance significantly in death anxiety. The findings were discussed on the basis of relevant literature and some suggestions were made

AB  - This paper outlines a novel approach to calibrating satellite derived relative depth surfaces generated using the ratio transform algorithm first proposed by Stumpf et al. The method utilizes raster image equal interval classification to generate depth classes and to identify both the upper and lower limits of sensitivity to the depth signal within the relative depth models. The method was trialed on a multidecadal set of Landsat images for a coastal compartment on the SE Australian coast.

AB  - Virtual Water Values (ViWA) is a collaborative project for multiscale monitoring of the geographic distribution of water resources and options for their sustainable use. The main target of the project is to support the implementation of the water-related UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Herein we present a methodology for the investigation of the present distribution of water resources and the pathways towards the development of feasible solution options for decision-making in different scales.The European Earth observation program COPERNICUS is the main source of remote sensing data for this study. Further understanding of the present water situation is acquired through the application of environmental and socioeconomic models. The volume and complexity of the data requires its management and processing in Big Data environment. Through sustainability assessment of the data and the present water use governance practices, the hot spot areas with a high risk of unsustainable water use are located.

TI  - Comparison of Aerosol Optical Depth Products from Multi-Satellites over Densely Populated Cities of Pakistan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL LETTERS OF NATURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution in Pakistan is causing damage to health, environment and quality of life. Air pollution in Pakistan is not effectively monitored due to heavy cost involved in setting up ground stations. However, Satellite remote sensing can effectively monitor the air pollution in terms of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at regional as well as global level. However, algorithms used to derive AOD from different sensors have some inherited differences which can pose challenges in monitoring regional AOD at high temporal resolution using more than one sensor. Therefore, this study focuses on comparison of four major satellite based AOD products namely Moderate Resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MODIS), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), Ozone Monitoring Instrument multiwavelength (OMI) aerosol product and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) with the ground based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD which is only available from Lahore and Karachi in Pakistan. The correlation of various AOD products with AERONET AOD is estimated statistically through coefficient of determination (R-2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), slope and intercept. It is noticed that MODIS is relatively accurate and reliable for monitoring air quality on operational bases over the land cover area of Lahore (R-2 = 0.78; RMSE = 0.18), whereas MISR over the coastal areas of Karachi (R-2 = 0.82; RMSE = 0.20). The results of the study will help the stakeholders in planning additional ground stations for operational monitoring of air quality at regional level.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Canadian Arctic is currently subject to increased mapping activities for providing better knowledge to assist in making informed decisions for sustainable development. Surficial material maps are one of the required maps. For an area located in Nunavut, we produced a map with 21 surficial material classes by applying a non-parametric classifier, Random Forests (RF), to a combination of RADARSAT-2 C-HH and C-HV with Landsat-8 OLI, digital elevation model, and slope data. We also tested the All-polygon and Sub-polygon scripts of RF. Validation accuracies were determined by comparing the resulting maps to more than 1000 field sites. By adding RADARSAT-2 dual-polarized images, the classification overall accuracy increases from 90.6% to 96.4% with the Sub-polygon script and from 92.8% to 98.1% with the All-polygon script. The overall validation accuracy increases from 76.3% to 88.9% with the Sub-polygon script and from 76.4% to 93.3% with the All-polygon script. With the All-polygon script, the validation accuracies are above 85% for all classes, except the user's accuracy of gravelly till (76.7%) and the producer's accuracy of sand and gravel with vegetation (70%), both classes being confused with thin till over bedrock.

T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - The methods of satellite monitoring of dangerous ice formations, namely icebergs in the Arctic seas, representing a threat to the safety of navigation and economic activity on the Arctic shelf are considered. The main objective of the research is to develop methods for detecting icebergs using satellite radar data and high space resolution images in the visible spectral range. The developed method of iceberg detection is based on statistical criteria for finding gradient zones in the analysis of two-dimensional fields of satellite images. The algorithms of the iceberg detection, the procedure of the false target identification, and determination the horizontal dimensions of the icebergs and their location are described. Examples of iceberg detection using satellite information with high space resolution obtained from Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 satellites are given. To assess the iceberg threat, we propose to use a model of their drift, one of the input parameters of which is the size of the detected objects. Three possible situations of observation of icebergs are identified, namely, the status state of objects: icebergs on open water; icebergs in drifting ice; and icebergs in the fast ice. At the same time, in each of these situations, the iceberg can be grounded, that prevents its moving. Specific features of the iceberg monitoring at various status states of them are considered. The status state of the iceberg is also taken into account when assessing the degree of danger of the detected object. The use of iceberg detection techniques based on satellite radar data and visible range images is illustrated by results of monitoring the coastal areas of the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago. The approaches proposed to detect icebergs from satellite data allow improving the quality and efficiency of service for a wide number of users with ensuring the efficiency and safety of Arctic navigation and activities on the Arctic shelf.

AB  - The present article considers the phenomenon of self-identification. Primary school age (from 7 to 11 years old) is an appropriate period to observe the dynamics of self-identification. This is the moment when children are able to reflect and draw their conclusions about themselves and verbalize their own characteristics. In the article, the authors present the results of the study, in which they make an attempt to portray a primary school child growing up in the modern social contexts through the characteristics and representations of children themselves, their interests, preferences, and inclinations for certain objects and subjects. The authors' objective is to reveal peculiarities of self-identification and worldview at an early school age. Data collection, projective conversation and content analysis are used as the methods appropriate to the age characteristics of primary school children. The authors prove that the child's views on himself/herself as a person are characterized mainly by positive modality and orientation to the present moment of life. Children aged 7-9 years old differentiate personal objective features positioning themselves in the system of family relationships, in the peer group and school community. By the end of junior school age (10-11 years old), children distinguish their own subjective characteristics. Leisure is the main activity for most of children. Along with the educational activity, play is of great importance at primary school age. In the overwhelming majority of cases, children see the mother, parents and family as the main objects of love.. (C) 2018 Published by Future Academy

AB  - This study is focused on presenting a methodology for estimating Total Suspended Solids (TSS) over two key strategic sites in SW Iberian Peninsula. The dataset used includes multi-temporal Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A imagery during 2016. The application of the effective ACOLITE processor and the high quality of SWIR bands improve the atmospheric correction in these extremely turbid waters. A multi-conditional algorithm that uses both red and NIR reflectance is able to provide accurate TSS retrievals in the upper and lower reaches of the Guadalquivir estuary and Cadiz Bay. The level of spatial detail afforded by these observations at fine resolution (10-30m) allows a much in deep understanding of the timing and importance of turbidity plumes. The results indicate that the proposed approach is effective for fusing both missions (MAE of 5.21 mg/L and 3.89 mg/L in estuary and bay, respectively), producing more frequency for continuous monitoring, which is particularly valuable at these latitudes that are severely covered (similar to 50%) by clouds and sunglint. These findings encourage further research with great implications to establish a continuous framework for the upcoming high-resolution services relying on both missions.

AB  - Due to its isolated location, Chile's flora is characterized by a large number of endemic species which has guided the decision to assign central Chile the status of a global biodiversity hotspot. This biodiversity hotspot is, however, endangered by severe land-use changes occurring over the last few decades as well as by an increased number of invasive species, competing with native vegetation. Some of these invasive species benefit from or even depend on disturbance events for dispersal. Hence, a reliable reconstruction of vegetation disturbance is likely to be an important variable for explaining currently observed distribution patterns of invasive species. Here, we combine Landsat-based time series of three vegetation indices (NDVI, NDMI, NBR2) with the time-series-analysis algorithms BFAST and LandTrendr to reconstruct the disturbance history of central Chile for the time period between 1998 and 2015. First results led to overall accuracies of approximately 61-74% and 55-90% for BFAST (NBR2) and LandTrendr (NDVI), respectively. Results were notably influenced by the composition (disturbance types) of the reference data where clear-cuts were detected with notably higher accuracies than fires. The first results obtained by merging the results from several indices and both disturbance detection algorithms did not notably improve the performance but these experiments are still on-going. The obtained disturbance maps agree well with expected processes, that is an increased number of disturbance events in the Western part of the study area which is dominated by forest industry and a reduced number of disturbances in the East where the complex terrain of the Andes mountains largely prevents industrial forest activities.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this contribution, we assess the vertical accuracy of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D 30m (AW3D30) digital elevation model (DEM) using the runway method (RWYM). The RWYM utilizes the longitudinal profiles of runways which are reliable and ubiquitous reference data. A reference dataset used in this project consists of 36 runways located at various points throughout the world. We found that AW3D30 has a remarkably low root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.78m (one sigma). However, while analysing the results, it has become apparent that it also contains a widespread elevation anomaly. We conclude that this anomaly is the result of uncompensated sensor noise and the data processing algorithm. Also, we note that the traditional accuracy assessment of a DEM does not allow for identification of these type of anomalies in a DEM.

AB  - Considering diverse vegetation types and complex land cover changes in urban and surrounding areas, a new method was developed for phenology extraction in urban and surrounding areas using Landsat time series and global generic endmembers from standardized spectral mixing analysis. NDVI and EVI time series from Landsat images were also generated for comparison. Landsat time series images over Beijing area of three different years, i.e., 1990, 2000 and 2014, and total 83 scenes were used in this study. The results of phenology extraction from vegetation fraction showed slightly better than those from EVI, and much better than those from NDVI. It also showed that the characteristics of vegetation phenology in urban and surrounding areas have obvious differences in spatial distribution and among different vegetation types. The method provides an effective tool for phenology extraction and analysis in urban areas.

AB  - Space mapping satellites play an increasingly important role in Space mapping satellites play an increasingly important role in mapping and mapping. The positioning accuracy of mapping satellites is the core and key index for evaluating the performance of Surveying and mapping. At present, it has developed to the precision of the meter level. Therefore, in the design process of Surveying and mapping camera, it is not only necessary to ensure that the image has good MTF, signal to noise ratio, dynamic range and other basic radiation characteristics, but also need to focus on the high precision calibration of the interior orientation elements of optical system distortion, optical axis, focal distance and other questions of orbit stability.In 2012 and 2016, China successfully launched ZY-3 (01/02) satellites, with a three-line-arrays camera and a multispectral camera. It is mainly used for the production of basic geographic information products of 1:50000 scale, and modification and updating of 1:25000 and larger scale topographic maps in China. The satellites have achieved good application results. Based on these experiences, driven by higher precision surveying and mapping requirements, as the main development and research organization of the Chinese space optical remote sensing camera, BISME has carried out a serial of research in the overall design of the space optical surveying camera. This paper gives some own views about the research for discussion and exchange.

AB  - Crop residues, which remained in the farmland after crop harvesting, have positive impacts on the carbon sequestration and the prevention of soil erosion. Remote sensing methods can efficiently assess crop residue cover and related tillage intensity in a region. Up to now, many tillage indices have been proposed to estimate crop residue cover. Although the tillage indices based on the hyper-spectral image (e.g., Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI) and Lignin-Cellulose Absorption (LCA) index) have a better result in crop residue cover assessment, it's short of free remote sensing data having the corresponding band width to them, after the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) were out of effect successively. Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2 can provide enough free data, but the band width is too broad for CAI and LCA. Thus, it's of great importance to seek the best indices based on the broad-spectral image to estimate the crop residue cover. The objective of this research is to compare the effect of common tillage indices based on the broad-spectral, and then chose the most suitable indices to estimate the winter wheat crop residue cover in Yucheng county of China. The indices involved Normalized Difference Index 5 (NDI5), Normalized Difference Index 7 (NDI7), Simple Tillage Index (STI), Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI), Normalized Differential Senescent Vegetation Index (NDSVI), Crop Residue Cover Index 1 (CRC1)and Normalized Difference Residue Index (NDRI). Thirty fields were measured with the area of each was 10000m2. Nine sub-flelds(1m x 1m) were placed uniformly in one field and the mean spectra and crop residue cover of them were used to stand for the field's. Reflectance spectral was measured in the field using the Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD), it covered the 350-2400nm wavelength region. Digital photos were taken in the field and analyzed indoors to obtain the area ratio of crop residue. Simple linear regression was applied on the tillage indices counted from the field reflectance data and the crop residue cover. The coefficient of determination (R2) between NDTI and crop residue cover was highest with 0.480 while the STI had an approximate R2 of 0.478. The R2 of NDI5, NDI7, NDSVI, CRC1, NDRI with the crop residue were 0.382,0.460,0.294,0.123 and 0.420, which reveals NDTI was the most suitable indices in this field. In the study area, the winter wheat crop residue cover mainly concentrated on 80%-95% which proved conservation tillage practices have been generalized in this study and the behavior of burning straw have become less for the ban of the policy and the improvement of farmers' environment awareness.

AB  - The colored dissolved organic matter, abbreviated as CDOM, is an important ingredient that affects the light absorption characteristics of seawater, and one of the key elements for ocean color research. In the case of only few focus on temporal and spatial variation of CDOM in tropical East Indian Ocean, this paper analyzes the CDOM spectral characteristics of this area based on the optical data of the summer survey in Southeast Indian Ocean in 2016, the variation and the related factors affecting the CDOM absorption characteristics of this area by using MODIS/VIIRS satellite remote sensing data. The results shows that 1) the CDOM absorption spectrum meets quasi-exponential decay characteristics, and the surface a(g) (440) changes from 0.002 to 0.098 m(-1), which is smaller than that of inshore water is larger than that of Southeast Pacific Ocean; 2) a(g) (440) in 8 degrees S is significantly greater than 5 degrees S, and the maximum appears in the southwest of the observation area (88 degrees E, 8 degrees S); 3) above the shallow depth of 100m, a(g) (440) tends to increase with depth; 4) the distribution of surface CDOM absorption coefficient shows significant consistency with chlorophyll concentration (r=0.8495), while not related to sea surface temperature (r=0.0064). CDOM and chlorophyll have similar driving mechanisms in the research area. The spatial distribution of CDOM is influenced by the subaqueous equatorial currents, the low-temperature waters from the Southern Ocean, and short-term small-scale effects, while the profile distribution is related to light field and nutrients. This study provides a further reference for understanding the optical properties of tropical waters in the East Indian Ocean.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Conference on Sustainable Water Resources Management
CL  - Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC
AB  - Mapping irrigated surfaces and the crops growing on these surfaces by using Remote Sensing is a well known first relevant step to contribute to water governance at different scales ranging from farm, irrigation scheme and, by scaling-up, to the whole river basin. These maps provide a first estimation of the spatially distributed water flows about evapotranspiration and irrigation water requirements based on the cropping agronomic knowledge. During the last 20 years, annual maps of crops and irrigated surfaces elaborated by using time series of multispectral satellite imagery have been in the basis of a successful water management of a big groundwater body placed in the Southern Spain. Threatened by over-exploitation, this aquifer extends over around 10,000 km(2) of land surface, in the middle Jucar river basin, supporting around 100,000 ha of irrigated crops, and providing drinking water for 150,000 inhabitants, with competing uses from downstream users. This paper describes the main learned lessons. In addition, the paper tackles a necessary further step in the context of the current requirements for water governance of this aquifer: the direct remote sensing-based water accounting, by quantifying agricultural water flows (e.g. rainfall, irrigation, evapotranspiration, drainage and recharge, at practical spatial and temporal scales for water governance purposes). This RS-based WA approach relies on dense time series of multispectral imagery acquired by the multisensor constellation formed by Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, jointly with meteorological data. By this, we discuss the technical and non-technical feasibility to rely monitoring water abstraction on this RS-based WA approach, providing the basis for a hybrid system.

AB  - The paper presents the analyses of different aerosol type over Timisoara, Romania. The study is relying on detailed physical and optical aerosol properties, data collected from the sun photometer located at Mechanical Engineering Faculty, Politehnica University Timisoara during 2011 and 2012. By analysing aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom parameter (alpha), single scattering albedo and size distribution the types of aerosol are determined. A high AOD (>0.6) and a low value of Angstrom parameter (alpha<0.6) represents an atmosphere with dust, respectively if alpha>1.5 the atmosphere is loaded with biomass burning aerosol. Also, for industrial aerosol or urban pollution the aerosol optical depth is between 0.3 and 0.6 and the Angstrom parameter takes values from 1.2 to 1.6. Dust and biomass dispersion was investigated by using NOOA HYSPLIT model (Hybrid Single - Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory). Other main parameter calculated in this study is Angstrom turbidity coefficient which values are from 0 (clear atmosphere) to 0.5 (high aerosol load). Global Fire Maps from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) were used to identify biomass burning sites.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Cole Museum of Zoology (REDCZ) at the University of Reading was founded in the early 20th century by Professor Francis Joseph Cole. Comparative animal anatomy is the principal scientific focus of the collection, represented by taxidermy, skeletons, histological preparations, fluid-preserved dissections, fossil material, casts, and some superb models of developmental stages. Overall, the collection contains over 3,200 fluid-preserved and dry specimens in addition to many hundreds of specimens in satellite collections used for teaching (approximately 38,000 specimens in total). More than 50% of the specimens are vertebrates, which reflects both Professor Cole's research interests and the need to illustrate a curriculum that was heavily focused on vertebrates. Cole was an important figure in early 20th century zoology and became a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He was the driving force behind zoology at the University of Reading, and it is a testament to his vision that we still teach BSc Zoology using his collection. The museum is currently housed in its third home, but after just under 50 years in one spot, 2019 will see it moved to a new Health and Life Sciences building as an integral part of the entrance foyer. It is hoped that 2019 will herald a new era for the museum, beginning on the journey towards a 200 year history at the University.

AB  - The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a very important atmospheric parameter which knowledge will help to understand the atmospheric processes and to propose different scenarios related with climate change. AOD plays a main role in the energy radiation balance in the atmosphere and in the aerosol radiative forcing. In this paper an analysis of time series of AOD, from MYD04_3K (MODIS Aqua Aerosols product gridded in a resolution of 3 kilometres), is analysed by means of Fourier Harmonics tool. Results shown in this paper are preliminary results because a more comprehensive study is envisaged where data coming from sun and lunar photometers installed in Artic stations will be analysed jointly.

AB  - In this work, we present a framework to integrate physically based hydroclimatological models and remote sensing products, by exploiting their advantages and overcoming their limitations, for an improved understanding and estimation of the alpine glacier accumulation and ablation processes. The capability of remote sensing to well represent the spatial variability of the snow cover over the glaciers is used to correct possible errors in the model simulations, thus obtaining a more reliable estimation of annual glacier mass balance. The proposed approach is tested on the glaciers in the Rofen Valley (Austria) by employing the AMUNDSEN model for accumulation and ablation processes simulation and Landsat-5/7/8 data for glacier zone mapping from 1998 to 2016.

TI  - Climatic conditions and fire regime affect vegetation recovery after large wildfires in Pinus forest ecosystems
T2  - ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH 2018
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th International Conference on Forest Fire Research
CL  - Coimbra, PORTUGAL
AB  - Fire is one of the most important disturbance processes in Pinus forest ecosystems in the Mediterranean Basin. These ecosystems differ markedly in their response to this disturbance. They rely on climatic conditions in the area, fire regime and biological traits of the vegetation. Thus, understanding the influence of climatic conditions and fire characteristics in shaping postfire vegetation recovery will help to identify the most appropiate post-fire management strategies.During recent decades, wildfire ocurrence in fire-prone ecosysems in the Mediterranean Basin has increased because of changes in land use, increased fuel load and continuity in the landscape. Moreover, these socio-ecological changes are related to the increase in burn severity and the surface affected. These large wildfires usually result in high heterogenous spatial mosaics with different degrees of severity and recurrence, which clearly influence vegetation regeneration capacity. However, fire regime characteristics not only affect vegetation regeneration after wildfire but also climatic conditions and their functional traits. Many authors recognise that in situations of high recurrence, resprouter species have an advantage over seeders.To determine how vegetation regeneration in a Pinus fire-prone ecosystem may be related to climatic gradients, fire regime characteristics and plant traits, we selected three large wildfires that occurred in the Iberian Peninsula during 2012 and 2013: the Carnota wildfire in Atlantic climate conditions (Galicia), the Sierra del Teleno wildfire in transition climatic conditions (Leon) and the Cortes de Pallas wildfire in Mediterranean climatic conditions (Valencia). In each study area, a burn severity map of two levels (low and high) was obtained from a classification (threshold) of a Landsat-based differenced Normalized Burn Ratio image. Moreover, in each fire scar we evaluated recurrence in the last 20 years and differentiated two recurrence situations: low (1 wildfire) and high (2 or more wildfires). As a result, four scenarios were differentiated: low recurrence-low severity, low recurrence-high severity, high recurrence-low severity and high recurrence-high severity.In each scenario, a proportional number of 2 m x 2 m plots were established. In each plot, we sampled the visual cover percentage of all plant taxa in 4 subplots of 1 m(2) three years after the wildfire. Mean cover values of Pinus saplings and resprouter and seeder shrubs were differentiated and compared among fire regime scenarios and climatic conditions. We observed diferences in the regeneration patterns in the three study sites, with more similarity between the Transition and Mediterranean ones. The common pattern of regeneration among the three climatic conditions has a significant negative effect on Pinus recruitment and cover in scenarios of high recurrence with low and high severity. At the same time, the resprouter shrubs species were favored by high recurrence.

TI  - The Use of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in <i>BRCA1</i>/<i>2</i> Mutation Carriers Undergoing Prophylactic Mastectomy: A Retrospective Consecutive Case-Series Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Sentinel lymph node biopsy in prophylactic mastectomy is controversial. It avoids lymphadenectomy in occult carcinoma but is associated with increased morbidity. Women with BRCA mutations have a higher incidence of occult carcinoma and our objective was to assess the clinical utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy when these women undergo prophylactic mastectomy. Materials and Methods. Seven-year retrospective consecutive case-series study of women, with a BRCA deleterious mutation, admitted to prophylactic mastectomy, at our center. Breast MRI < 6 months before surgery was routine, unless contraindicated. Results. Fifty-seven patients (43% BRCA1; 57% BRCA2) underwent 80 prophylactic mastectomies. 72% of patients had had breast cancer treated before prophylactic mastectomy or synchronously to it. The occult carcinoma incidence was 5%, and half of the cases were invasive. SLNB was performed in 19% of the prophylactic mastectomies; none of these had tumor invasion. Women with invasive carcinoma who had not undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy were followed closely with axillary ultrasound. The median follow-up was 37 months, with no local recurrence; 1 patient died of primary tumor systemic relapse. Conclusions. Our data do not support this procedure for routine (in agreement with previous literature), in this high risk for occult carcinoma population.

TI  - Historical Delineation of Landscape Units Using Physical Geographic Characteristics and Land Use/Cover Change
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape units are conceived as a part of the territory that share similar physical and geographic characteristics. Their delineation can contribute to identify the physical and social dynamics that emerge in the spatial environment and to propose strategies of planning and management of the territory. The main objective was to make a historical delineation of landscape units in the Duero river basin that demonstrate the dynamics of changes in the territory, the description of the actors involved, and the affectations in the natural and social environment. We analyzed the vegetation change and urban growth from 1983 to 2014, incorporating climatic, edaphic, and topographic variables. A Principal Component Analysis was performed with the information and results were used in Maximum Likelihood procedure to define different clusters based on environmental characteristics. We defined five categories from the Landsat images. Results showed landscape units with homogeneous environmental characteristics and some differences in the units' delineation were mainly influenced by political and socioeconomic factors. Temporally there was an increased tendency of landscape units, three in 1983, nine in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2011, and eight in 2014. This increase resulted from territory fragmentation because of berries and avocado cultivars expansion over wooded area.

AB  - FSSCAT is an innovative mission concept consisting of two federated 6U Cubesats in support of the Copernicus Land and Marine Environment services. The first CubeSat carries the Flexible Microwave Payload-2 (FMPL-2), a dual microwave payload (a GNSS-Reflectometer and an L-band radiometer with interference detection/mitigation), and the second one a hyper-spectral optical payload. The combined use of these payloads will allow to measure soil moisture, ice extent, and ice thickness, and to detect melting ponds over ice. FSSCAT also includes radio and optical inter-satellite links to test some of the techniques and technologies for the upcoming satellite federations. FSSCAT will be the precursor of a constellation of federated small satellites for Earth observation achieving high temporal resolution and moderate spatial resolution in a cost-effective manner.

AB  - Hydrothermal alteration is one of the most important steps in the exploration of precious ore deposits. In this study, it is aimed to detect the hydrothermal alteration areas and mineral contents they preserve with ASTER and Hyperion satellite images and compare the obtained results. Because of the presence of intensive hydrothermal alteration and poor vegetation, the area which is located at the northern part of Zara district of Sivas Province has been chosen as the study area. Contact zones of Argillic (Kaolinite, illite), phyllic (serisite, muscovite) and propylitic (chlorite, calsite, epidote) alteration areas were detected with field studies, petrographic and geochemical investigations. The spectral signatures of hydrothermal minerals were measured via ASD spectroradiometer from the representative samples belonging to hydrothermal alteration study areas. According to the results, obtaining the hydrothermal alteration maps from ASTER and Hyperion satellite data are in coincide with the geological map.

TI  - Protocol for Compass: a randomised controlled trial of primary HPV testing versus cytology screening for cervical cancer in HPV-unvaccinated and vaccinated women aged 25-69 years living in Australia
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Australia's National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) currently recommends 2-year cytology in women aged 18-69 years. Following a review of the NCSP prompted by the implementation of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, the programme will transition in 2017 to 5-year primary HPV screening with partial genotyping for HPV16/18 in women aged 25-74 years. Compass is a sentinel experience for the renewed NCSP and the first prospectively randomised trial of primary HPV screening compared with cytology to be conducted in a population with high uptake of HPV vaccination. This protocol describes the main Compass trial, which commenced after a pilot study of similar to 5000 women completed recruitment.Methods and analysis Women aged 25-69 years will be randomised at a 1:2 allocation to (1) 2.5-year image-read, liquid-based cytology (LBC) screening with HPV triage of low-grade smears (active control Arm A) or (2) 5-year HPV screening with partial genotyping and referral of HPV16/18-positive women to colposcopy (intervention Arm B). Women in Arm B positive for other oncogenic HPV (not 16/18) will undergo secondary randomisation at a 1:1 allocation to either LBC or dual-stained (p16(INK4a) and Ki-67) cytology testing (dual-stained cytology). The primary outcome is cumulative CIN3+ (CIN3, adenocarcinoma in situ and invasive cervical cancer) following a 5-year HPV exit testing round in both arms, in women randomised to the HPV arm versus women randomised to the LBC arm, based on an intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome will first be tested for non inferiority and if declared, the primary outcome will be tested for superiority. A total of 36 300 women in birth cohorts riot offered vaccination and 84 700 women in cohorts offered vaccination will be recruited, bringing the final sample size to 121 000. The trial is powered for the secondary outcome of cumulative CIN3+ in screen-negative women, adjusted for censoring after CIN2+ treatmentand hysterectomy.Ethics and dissemination Approved by the Bellberry Ethics Committee (2014-11-592). Findings will be reported in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings.

T2  - QUESTION OF METHODOLOGICAL NATURALISM
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Peter L. Berger famously argued that any scientific inquiry into religious matters must be "methodologically atheistic." But methodological atheism performs no proper normative function in the academic study of religion; it fabricates, trivializes, and renders inexplicable religious experience; it is not neutral or objective; and the argument for its normativity improperly legitimates a secular worldview. Furthermore, the argument for the normativity of methodological agnosticism suffers some of the same flaws and has distinctive flaws of its own, including hindering scholars from articulating good reasons to believe that certain religious experiences are delusions and exhibiting self-referential incoherence.

AB  - Multi-angle information extraction is very important for the validation of land surface models, such as bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model and directional brightness temperature (DBT) model. The experiment can be done in the near surface, on the plane, and on the satellite. The spatial-temporal average method is widely-used on the scale of plane. In this paper, we try to extend it to extract the multi-angle information from near surface observation sensors. We found this method can obtain good result over homogeneous land surface, but the observation protocol is critical over heterogeneous land surface. For instance, the observation plane should be perpendicular to the row direction. In addition, we found that the hot spot area will be shaded by the observation platform which leads to the BRDF result to be affected seriously.

AB  - Accurate mapping of urban land cover is still a fundamental challenge in remote sensing communities due to the great spectral variability of urban environments. This study presents an application of multiple criteria spectral mixture analysis (MCSMA) approach to map vegetation, impervious surfaces, and soil (V-I-S) components in a highly urbanized city of Chengdu, China, using the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance product. Unlike its counterparts which rely on single indicator in the mapping process, MCSMA uses multiple indicators to better address the problem of spectral variability. Our results showed that MCSMA produced accurate V-I-S maps that well matched the actual distributions. The vegetation map presented higher accuracies than impervious surfaces and soil maps in root mean square error, mean absolute error and systematic error. Results of this study demonstrate the potential of MCSMA in accurate urban land cover mapping.

TI  - An integrated soft and hard classification approach for evaluating urban expansion from multisource remote sensing data: a case study of the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan metropolitan region, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating soft and hard classification to monitor urban expansion can effectively provide comprehensive urban growth information to urban planners. In this study, both the impervious surface coverage (as a soft classification result) and land cover (as a hard classification result) in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan metropolitan region (BTTMR), China, were extracted from multisource remote sensing data from 1990 to 2015. Then, we evaluated urban expansion based on centre migration, standard deviation ellipse, and spatial autocorrelation metrics. Furthermore, the differences between the soft and hard classification results were analysed at the landscape scale. The results showed that (1) the impervious surface area increased considerably over the past 25years. Notably, the areas of urban built-up land and industrial production land increased rapidly, while those of ecological land and agricultural production land seriously decreased. (2) The distribution of impervious surfaces was closely related to the regional economic development plan of One Axis, Two Wing, and Multi-Node' in the BTTMR. (3) The contributions of different land use types to impervious surface growth ranked from high to low as follows: urban built-up land, rural residential land, industrial production land, agricultural production land, and ecological land. (4) The landscape metrics varied considerably based on the hard and soft classification results and were sensitive to different factors.

TI  - A three-class change detection methodology for SAR-data based on hypothesis testing and Markov Random field modelling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a new automatic change detection process chain based on bi-temporal co-registered and calibrated Sentinel-1 level-1 Interferometric Wide Ground Range Detected C-band synthetic aperture radar intensity imagery. The whole processor contains three main components: firstly, a preprocessing step is used to perform geometrical and radiometrical calibration. Secondly, an automatic coarse detection step is applied based on a statistical hypothesis test to obtain an initial classification. Thirdly, a post-classification step is introduced to optimize the initial classification result in the form of minimizing a global energy function defined on a Markov Random Field. In this study, a graph-cut algorithm is applied iteratively to solve the global optimization problem. At each iteration, the data energy function for the current classification is set by the logarithmic probability density function. The relevant parameters are estimated by the method of logarithmic cumulants. Supplemental data is presented to explain the formulae used in this study. Experiments are performed using a flood event which occurred in 2015 along the coastline of Greece near Kavala region and the Evros River at the border between Greece and Turkey. The proposed method shows a satisfying classification result with overall accuracy above 95% and kappa coefficient above 0.87.

AB  - The paper presents an original neural network approach for region of interest detection and classification in multi-spectral satellite images. The proposed method uses a sequence of Pulse Coupled Neural Networks that identifies plausible regions of interest. These regions are passed to a dimension reduction algorithm, Principle Component Analysis, in order to generate the input data for a Support Vector Machine classifier, that validates the data. The algorithm's parameters are optimized using a Genetic Algorithm. The algorithm is designed to distinguish regions that are extremely similar, such as parks in a city that has entire districts made up of houses with yards. The algorithm has been tested on images provided by the Sentinel-2 satellite, and it proved that it can recall 76.85% of the pixels marked as park in the ground truth data, which was obtained from Open Street Map.

TI  - Analysis of land-use/land-cover changes in a livestock landscape dominated by traditional silvopastoral systems: a methodological approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing, which is a common method to examine land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes, could be useful in the analysis of livestock ecosystem transformations. In the last two decades, before Landsat images were free, developing countries could not afford monitoring through remote sensing because of the high cost of acquiring satellite imagery and commercial software. However, Landsat time series nowadays allows the characterization of changes in vegetation across large areas over time. The aim of this study is to analyse the LULC changes affecting forest frontiers and traditional silvopastoral systems (TSPS) in a representative livestock area of Nicaragua. Nearly cloud-free Landsat scenes - a Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) scene from 1986 and a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) scene from 2015 - have been the data sets used in the study. A process chain following a four-step definition of the remote-sensing process was conceptually developed and implemented based onfree open source software components and by applying the random forest (RF) algorithm. A conceptual LULC classification scheme representing TSPS was developed. Although the imagery shows a heterogeneous surface cover and mixed pixels, it is possible to achieve promising classification results with the RF algorithm with out-of-the-bag (OOB) errors below 13% for both images along with an overall accuracy level of 85.9% for the 2015 subset and 85.2% for the 1986 subset. The classification shows that from 1986 to 2015 (29years) the intervened secondary forest (ISF) increased 2.6 times, whereas the degraded pastures decreased by 34.5%. The livestock landscape in Matiguas is in a state of constant transformation, but the main changes head towards the positive direction of tree-cover recovery and an increased number of areas of natural regeneration.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Symposium on Greener Cities for More Efficient Ecosystem Services in a Climate Changing World

AB  - Climate change mitigation measures are a current need to achieve sustainable cities. Scientific knowledge about thermal stress of the urban fabrics with different greening patches might be useful input for urban planning and the real estate market. The purpose of the paper is to compare the thermal comfort of urban spaces with varying greenery density in the occurrence of an extreme summer event. Santiago of Chile has a mild climate, quite similar to other cities in the world so an index obtained from monitoring might be useful to share with others. Monitoring with hygro-thermometers were used to measure ambient air temperature and relative humidity on the hottest summer during the last 30 years. Infrared images such as LANDSAT 8 provides a spatial distribution of heating in middle summer 2017. The method considered both spatial and time scales to analyze thermal stress on types of outdoor spaces: a sunny one, a canyon and one in a park. Findings show proportional hygro-thermal values between those spaces. Thermal comfort is also affected by greenery density in every outdoor space reaching stress in some of them which is quite relevant under extreme summer temperatures along three decades. Some conclusions highlight ranges in values obtained from monitoring and bioclimatic tools appropriate for urban and environmental planning in order to get climate change mitigation. Matching outdoor space and greenery densities could be an interesting point for sustainable architecture and urban design.

TI  - Fire and land use in recent years in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil
T2  - ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH 2018
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th International Conference on Forest Fire Research
CL  - Coimbra, PORTUGAL
AB  - The biome Atlantic Forest in Brazil covers a substantial portion of the country, where a large population and major cities are located. In spite of the substantial influence from human activities, the region is one of the most diverse tropical ecosystems with a large number of endemic species, and it is one of the world's biodiversity hotspot. In this region, fire is an important disturbance, due to its strong effects on nutrient cycling, vegetation succession, and atmospheric emissions of gases and aerosols, and therefore must be considered when planning on the sustainability of the region. This study presents a set of initial analyses of fire occurrence in respect to different types of land cover and use as classified by the recent Brazilian MapBiomas Project (http://mapbiomas.org). Information on fire occurrence are from remote-sensing with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 Active Fire Product. The data on fires data are for years 2001-2017. The selected data on land cover and use are for year 2010, nearly at the middle of the fire data time spam. For analyses, both datasets were aligned in space and aggregated at 0.5-deg spatial resolution. It was found that in average, most of fires happened during months with less precipitation, as expected. In comparison with other major biomes in Brazil, the density of fire detections in the Atlantic Forest was lower, but still a substantial number of fires are detected yearly in the region. Perhaps, more important is the fact that despite of most of fires detected with MODIS occurred in areas dominated by agriculture and pasture (as expected by the general relations between fire and land use in Brazil), a relatively high number of fires were detected in areas dominated by natural forests. That has important consequences for the high interest in conservation of the study region, based on its marked biodiversity and potential for providing relevant ecosystem services to society.

TI  - Potential of Sentinel-2 data in the detection of lithium (Li)-bearing pegmatites: a study case
T2  - EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS IX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Only recently remotely sensed data and image processing techniques have been used in the detection of lithium (Li)-bearing pegmatites because of the current growing importance and demand of Li for the construction of Li-ion batteries for electric cars. The study area of this work was the Fregeneda (Spain)-Almendra (Portugal) region, where different known types of Li-pegmatites have been mapped. The objective of this study is to develop a methodology considering remotely sensed data, capable of identifying Li-pegmatites based on the recognition of the associated alteration halos. For that, Level 1-C cloud free Sentinel-2 images with low vegetation coverage were used. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was computed and a threshold was considered (NDVI<0.2). This study also aims exploiting the potential of Sentinel-2 data for this purpose. Minerals have important absorption features in the visible and infrared regions. Based on these features and with the aim of determining the most accurate methodology, Sentinel-2 reflectance data was used to compute RGB combinations, band ratios, principal component analysis (PCA) and image classification (supervised). These methodologies allow to predict the occurrence of iron oxides and clay minerals, and to discriminate between non-altered and hydrothermally altered zones. Band ratio 3/8 also predicts the occurrence of Li-bearing minerals. The results of the application of remote sensing data, in particular, Sentinel-2 images and image processing techniques to Li-mineralizations is of great interest to mining companies since they could lead to an increased efficiency and sustainability of mineral exploration.

TI  - A six-year epidemiological surveillance study in Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia: urban versus rural differences in human campylobacteriosis incidence
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from population-based laboratory surveillance were used to examine the epidemiological pattern of campylobacteriosis in a sentinel site, Split-Dalmatia County (SDC),Croatia, from 2007 to 2012, and to evaluate the association between disease incidence and demographic, geographical, climatic, agricultural, and microbiological factors. A total of 2658 laboratory-confirmed Campylobacter infections were recorded. Overall mean incidence was 96/100,000, ranging from 61/100,000 in rural to 131/100,000 in urban areas; rates were highest in the age group 0-4years. Overall mean and age- and sex-specific incidences were significantly higher in urban versus rural areas (p<0.01). The number of infections peaked in early summer, and was correlated with higher average monthly temperature (r=0.58) and lower humidity (r=-0.27), but not with precipitation. Incidence was not associated with agricultural activities. A distinct campylobacteriosis pattern with consistently higher urban versus rural incidence was observed, which may help formulate further preventive measures.

TI  - Changes in state legislation and the impacts on elder financial fraud and exploitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELDER ABUSE & NEGLECT
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this paper is to summarize how state legislators are responding to the increasing incidence of elder financial fraud and exploitation (EFFE) and investigate the impact of new state legislation. Methods: Our empirical model investigates the impact of recent changes in state legislation, after controlling for relevant state demographics, on the prevalence of EFFE claims reported in the Consumer Sentinel Network database. We use panel data in a fixed effects model with and without time dummy variables. Results: States with additional penalties targeting EFFE have a significantly lower percentage of complaints from elders, whereas the impact of mandatory and protected voluntary reporting laws is not significant in this sample. Discussion: State legislators have increased their awareness of and are acting to produce legislation protecting the elderly from EFFE. Increased information, training and data sharing across states can go a long way to detecting and prosecuting EFFE cases.

T2  - BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD GEOLOGICA MEXICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main elements monitored in volcanic emissions is SO2 due to the contrast of concentrations between the volcanos compared to the background of the atmosphere Different methodologies have been developed from remote sensing techniques from the ground and from space In particular, the COSPEC technique has been used efficiently from terrestrial vehicles, allowing the emission rate of SO2 with estimated relative errors of +/- 13% to +/- 42% to be obtained However, the logistics required to carry out continuous measurement campaigns in the Popocatepetl area, allows exclusively 2 or 3 measurements a month and only during daylight hours. Another type of methodology based an remote sensing is the processing of satellite images in the thermal infrared In this case, the use of MODIS images allows obtaining daily SO2 information both in images taken at daylight hours or during the night period which gives a maximum temporal resolution of images fig the sensor in the study area (maximum 4 images per day). In order to construct time series from both techniques, the flux of SO2 derived from the COSPEC sensor are used as a reference, which allows the MODIS image identification within the area of the plume that was sampled with the COSPEC sensor. ate aim to propose an adjustment methodology to reconstruct the information with the aforementioned values. Between November 2006 to February 2007 in the Popocatepetl volcano area, we found a good witch between the two techniques; which indicates that the adjustment methodology proposal to obtain data calibration equations could he applied during periods of time when simultaneous data from both sensors are available.

T2  - CIENCIAS MARINAS
M3  - Article
AB  - We characterized the spatial and temporal variations of sea surface temperature (SST), satellite-derived chlorophyll a (Chl(sat)) concentration, and phytoplankton production (PP) along two 300-km long transects in the southernmost part of the California Current System, one off Cabo San Lazaro (TCSLa) and the other off Cabo San Lucas (TCSLu). Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Aqua-MODIS) SST and Chl(sat) monthly composites and PP monthly composites were used for the 2003-2016 period. An "average year" was generated for each transect and each variable, as an approximation to the climatology. The Chl(sat )and PP values were higher in the inshore area than in the offshore area: 4.0 mg.m(-3) and 4.5 g C.m(-2).d(-1), respectively, for the inshore area of TCSLa and 1.4 mg.m(-3) and 1.8 g C.m(-2).d(-1), respectively, for the inshore area of TCSLu; similar to 0.1 mg.m(-3) and 0.4 g C-m(-2).d(-1), respectively, for the offshore area of both transects. In general, SST showed minimum values (similar to 17.0 degrees C) in the inshore area and maximum values (similar to 29.4 degrees C) in the offshore area. Chl(sat) values in the coastal zone were higher on TCSLa than on TCSLu, but offshore Chl(sat) values were often higher on TCSLu than on TCSLa. Seasonal and interannual variations were observed on both transects, but the seasonal variations were dominant. The effects of "the Blob" in 2014 and of the 2015-2016 eastern Pacific type of El Nino were similarly strong off both capes but caused no collapse in phytoplankton biomass, which decreased to only approximately half the values for the non-El Nino years. The 2003 and 2010 central Pacific type of El Nino events also had strong impacts. The 2005 central Pacific type of El Nino had a strong impact on the biology of TCSLu, like the impact of the 2014 and 2015-2016 events, but not on the biology of TCSLa. The coastal dynamics in the California Current System show spatial variations; thus, seasonal and interannual events have different effects at different geographic locations.

AB  - Tropomi, successfully launched in October 2017, and Sentinel-5, with launch due in 2021, are two pushbroom spectrometers measuring Earth's radiance from a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at a high spectral resolution. Both instruments have strongly overlapping spectral channels (UV-VIS, NIR, SWIR-3). While the Tropomi spectrometers are designed with standard slits, all Sentinel-5 channels make use of complex slit assemblies called "slit homogenizers" that aim at mitigating the slit heterogeneous illumination that results from the along track spatial non-uniformity of the observed scenes, and is known to distort the instrument spectral response function (ISRF). The similarity between the two missions will allow, in a few years from now, to evaluate the performance gain resulting from these devices. If their expected success is confirmed, slit homogenizers may become standard components of future space missions.This paper aims at providing a comprehensive, yet as simple and accessible as possible, overview of the slit homogenizer performance. The Sentinel-5 slit homogenizers, based on two parallel mirrors will be discussed, and a new and promising family of slit homogenizer designs will be presented for the first time. The new designs offer several advantages in terms of performance and manufacturability.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Workshop on Schizophrenia and Common Sense - Explaining the Relation Between Madness and Social Values
CL  - Lisbon, PORTUGAL
AB  - The philosophy of psychiatry has recently begun to pay attention to the school of phenomenology initiated by Husserl and the 'therapeutic' philosophy of Wittgenstein in order to make sense of madness; Louis Sass is exemplary of this trend. J.J. Valberg argues that experience, as characterized by phenomenology, cannot be reconciled with the scientific worldview, due its all-encompassing character whereby everything that exists refers back to a central subject. He calls this the horizonal conception of experience (Sect. 8.2.2). Nevertheless, in line with natural science he also thinks that experience is dependent upon the proper functioning of the brain and nervous system. Experience is thus paradoxically a small, contingent part of the world, and the necessary condition of there being a world at all (Sect. 8.3). Valberg argues that this combination generates insoluble "puzzles" for philosophy. Louis Sass finds strikingly similar paradoxes in the experiences of schizophrenic patients, who suffer from an 'impossible' lived situation, which they experience as a change to the nature of the world, rather than to their minds (Sect. 8.4). He argues that their illness is the result of a quasi-voluntary process of bringing pre-reflective backgrounds to consciousness into explicit awareness. In this paper, I shall investigate the parallels between what Valberg thinks is our natural human condition, and what Sass regards as psychopathology. I will conclude (Sect. 8.5) that Valberg's characterization of ordinary (non-pathological) consciousness as paradoxical indicates a limit to Sass's phenomenological psychiatry.

AB  - This work explores the dynamics of the water consumed by the vegetation in two Mediterranean watersheds of Sierra Nevada Mountains (Southern Spain). This region has experienced an increase in the demand of water in the last years due to the growth of irrigated areas, and a new water resources plan is required. The evapotranspiration (ET) of irrigated horticultural crops and natural communities were monitored for the hydrological years 2013/14 and 2014/15, using an approach based on the concept of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and canopy coefficients derived from the computation of vegetation indices (VIs), which we will call the VI-ETo approach. A set of Landsat-8 and MODIS images has been used as remote input data. The results were used for the spatial analysis of water consumption in terms of the main land cover types in the area. The annual runoff obtained with a simple surface water balance, using the ET values estimated by the VI-ETo approach, was comparable to that obtained by the HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning) model, a precipitation-runoff generation model that reproduces the observed river discharge at the outlet of the watershed.

TI  - Combining Remote Sensing and Field Mapping Methods to Study the Vegetation Dynamics within a Coastal Wetland and Determine the Habitat Effects of a Threatened Bird Species (<i>Emberiza</i> <i>schoeniclus</i> <i>witherbyi</i>)
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are highly dynamic changing ecosystems because of the effects of meteorology, wildlife interactions and human activities. They are one of the world's most threatened ecosystems, and threats to them drive the most specialist species to unfavorable conservation status and population trends. Therefore, it is important to frequently monitor the coverage changes of the different vegetation types to understand these species' population dynamics. However, frequent and detailed cartography entails costly efforts. Here, satellite images with field mapping were combined to create vegetation classification maps for past years from SPOT-5 images in the Pego-Oliva coastal wetland (Spain) and obtained classification accuracies above 85%. Together with habitat selection models, this information was used to understand the changes in the habitat of a threatened bird species, the Eastern Iberian reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus witherbyi), whose population has sharply declined in recent decades in Spain. A statistically significant reduction in reed-rush patches (positively selected habitat) and an increase in homogeneous reed patches (negatively selected habitat) were observed in those areas where the species disappeared as breeders. This study shows the potential of remote sensing and GIS techniques for the a posteriori monitoring of variation in the habitats available for threatened species to set up management and conservation measures.

Finally, an argumentative reflection is exposed on the metaphysical and ethical consequences to which some of these intelligent machines can give rise. Some of these consequences can be positive for the advancement of intelligence and universal knowledge, but others will be disastrous for the human species and for the planet. However, what is certain is that these technological advances will entail a change in the worldview paradigm with respect to the human species both in the conception of the human being and the entities as well as in the legal and behavioral sciences.

TI  - Compressed UAV sensing for flood monitoring by solving the continuous travelling salesman problem over hyperspectral maps

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have shown great capability for disaster management due to their fast speed, automated deployment and low maintenance requirements. In recent years, disasters such as flooding are having increasingly damaging societal and environmental effects. To reduce their impact, real-time and reliable flood monitoring and prevention strategies are required. However, the limited battery life of small lightweight UAVs imposes efficient strategies to subsample the sensing field in this context. This paper proposes a novel solution to maximise the number of inspected flooded surface while keeping the travelled distance bounded. Our proposal solves the so-called continuous Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the costs of travelling from one location to another depend not only on the distance, but also on the presence of water. To determine the optimal path between checkpoints, we employ the fast sweeping algorithm using a cost function defined from hyperspectral satellite maps identifying flooded regions. Preliminary results using MODIS flood maps show that our UAV planning strategy achieves a covered flooded surface approximately 3.33 times greater for the same travelled distance when compared to the conventional TSP solution. These results show new insights on the use of hyperspectral imagery acquired from UAVs to monitor water resources.

TI  - Optimized Antigen-Matched in Sickle Cell Disease Patients: Chances and Challenges in Molecular Times the Brazilian Way
T2  - TRANSFUSION MEDICINE AND HEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - The development of red blood cell (RBC) alloantibodies and autoantibodies complicates transfusion therapy in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. In an effort to reduce the risk of alloimmunization, some strategies have been used to provide antigen-matched RBC transfusions to patients with SCD in Brazil, including molecular matching in 3 levels: RH and K matching; extended matching (RH, KEL, FY, JK, MNS, DI), and extended matching including RHD and RHCE variant alleles. Molecular matching has shown clinical benefits to the patients with SCD, contributing significantly to reduce the rates of alloimmunization. Improvements in the clinical outcomes of the patients have also been observed as shown by an increase in their hemoglobin levels and reduction in their percentage of hemoglobin S as well as better in vivo RBC survival and diminished frequency of transfusions. However, prevention of RBC alloimmunization still remains a challenge in Brazil due to the difficulty to fulfill all transfusion requests of the patients with antigen-matching units, inaccuracy of RBC phenotyping, RBC transfusions outside the institution where the patient is treated, advanced age of some patients, the RBC antigen discrepancy between donors and recipients, and the presence of RH variants.

TI  - The sacralization of war in Late Antiquity: the battle of Carcassonne (589) and the other 300
T2  - REVISTA UNIVERSITARIA DE HISTORIA MILITAR
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we propose to address a key thought within the collective imaginary of Late Antiquity: the judgment of God as a historical category associated with a sin-punishment scheme and how this idea affects the Visigothic worldview of war, since it produces the intervention divine that derives the final result of the fight what, consequently, generates a process of sacralization of the war.We intend to achieve the aforementioned objective of this work through the study of the passages that appear in the Visigothic and frank literary sources of the Battle of Carcassonne in order to demonstrate the latent thought of the time and the mental scheme that underlies the historians of this epoch, since the battle will be taken as a punishment for some (francs) for their bad deeds and a victory granted by the deity for others (Visigoths) for their good deeds. Similarly, for the development of the battle, Visigothic historians will use biblical schemes to enhance the idea of divine intervention and to strengthen the concept of militia christi as opposed to militia diaboli. Also, when analyzing the well-known sides in the contest, we will take advantage to study the scheme that confronts the anointed king against the perfidious tyrant, aspect of capital importance to understand the conception of power in the Visigothic kingdom of Toledo. In the same way, we will demonstrate how the rebellion that precipitates this confrontation is not of a religious nature as traditional historiography has taken it, but its authentic nature is political and is framed within the common confrontation between nobility and monarchy that took place within the Toledo kingdom.Thanks to this analysis, we will obtain information about the categories of power and their conception in these kingdoms and the histological thinking of these primary sources, as well as draw conclusions about the conception of war and its sacralization in Late Antiquity where the civil language and politician is loaded with biblical dyes.

AB  - The present article pretends to show how from the arrival of the Spaniards to the American continent all the judicial and jurisdictional practices that existed in the discovered territory were lost, thanks to the ignorance of the natives as persons and the lack of interest for their ancestral practices, as well as his worldview and his own history. How the Indian judicial organs were integrated is unknown to the inhabitants of the American people since the entities created by the Spanish Monarchy not only contributed to the indigenous genocide of South America, but also to obliterate the way in which these peoples, resolved their conflicts The loss of the figure of the Cacique as the maximum earthly and spiritual authority, as well as the struggle of the aboriginal peoples, especially the Nasa peoples seeking their self-determination and autonomy, are clear examples of this legal genocide.Finally, it is from the constant social struggles that materialized in the new Colombian superior rule, Constitution of 1991, norm that under the protection of some international treaties and the interpretations of the Constitutional Court, in particular the decisions adopted by the first Court, they give relevance to the indigenous justice based on the formula of autonomy, self-determination and respect for their worldview, thus initiating the process of vindication of the culture of the ancestral peoples.

AB  - Agriculture monitoring is a key task for producers, governments and decision makers. The analysis of multitemporal remote sensing data provides a cost-effective way to perform this task. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been successfully used in temporal modeling problems, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNS) are the state-of-the-art in image classification, mainly due to their ability to capture spatial context. In this work, we propose the use of a hybrid network architecture for crop mapping that combines RNNs and CNNs. We evaluate this architecture experimentally upon a Sentinel-1A database from a tropical region in Brazil. The ability of recurrent networks to model temporal context is compared with the conventional image stacking approach. The impact of using CNN learned features rather than context aware handcrafted features is also investigated. In our analysis the hybrid architecture achieved better average class accuracy than alternative approaches based on image stacking and GLCM features.

M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of mosquito vectors of malaria is controlled by various factors such as climate, land cover and land use, or human activities. In the Amazon region, endemic foci of malaria persist, particularly on the border between French Guiana and Amapa State in Brazil. This area, long by 300 km, presents many difficulties in collecting informations necessary for the health management of the local populations. In this type of geographical context, with few, isolated and cross-border data, a methodology based on the exploitation of remote sensing images is particularly appropriate. Remote sensing data have wide spatial coverage, and a large range of spatial resolutions. Here we present an approach combining high resolution and very high spatial resolution optical and SAR satellite data. Our method makes it possible to map the different types of land cover in the tropical border context French Guiana - Brazil, characterized by a persistent cloud cover. The results show that the complementarity of optical and RADAR sensors allows the production of multi-scale mapping of land use/land cover (LULC) independently from cloud cover. In particular, we produced LULC classifications to generate spatialized indicators and characterize the relationship between suitable habitats for malaria vectors and environmental factors. Through a discussion on the application of composite LULC classifications for the assessment of malaria exposure risk at various scales, this case study illustrates the interest of satellite remote sensing approaches to characterize landscape elements and land cover, which can account for the distribution of vector populations in connection with arboviruses transmission.

TI  - Comparison of Split Window Algorithms for Retrieving Measurements of Sea Surface Temperature from MODIS Data in Near-Land Coastal Waters
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Split window (SW) methods, which have been successfully used to retrieve measurements of land surface temperature (LST) and sea surface temperature (SST) from MODIS images, were exploited to evaluate the SST data of three sections of Italian coastal waters. For this purpose, sea surface emissivity (SSE) values were estimated by adding the effects of salinity and total suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations, sea surface wind speed, and zenith observation angle. The total column atmospheric water vapor contents were retrieved from MODIS data. SST data retrieved from MODIS images using these algorithms were compared with SSTskin measurements evaluated from in situ data. The comparison showed that the algorithms for retrieving LST measurements minimized the error in SST data in near-land coastal waters with respect to the algorithms for retrieving SST measurements: a method for retrieving LST measurements highlighted the smallest root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value (0.48 K) and values of maximum bias and standard deviation (sigma) equal to -3.45 K and 0.41 K; the current operation algorithm for retrieving LST data highlighted the smallest values of maximum bias and sigma (-1.37 K and 0.35 K) and an RMSD value of 0.66 K; and the current operation algorithm for retrieving global measurements of SST showed values of RMSD, maximum bias, and sigma equal to 0.68 K, -1.90 K, and 0.40 K, respectively.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Earth-observation systems (satellites and in situ monitoring) are routinely used to collect information about water quality. Recently, smartphone-based tools and other citizen-science sensors have enabled citizens to also contribute to the collection of scientifically relevant data. This chapter describes a decision support system used to predict optical water-quality indicators in the Wadden Sea, which is an intertidal marine system, where natural processes related to sediment transport and primary production define the basis of its ecological values. As information sources, the system uses satellite data, data collected with a mobile app and physical data for the period 2003-2015. An artificial-intelligence technique, inductive learning, is used to analyze the data and provide predictions in terms of water colour represented via the Forel-Ule scale (a comparative scale for colour).

TI  - Snake species richness predicts breeding distribution of short-toed snake eagle in central Italy
T2  - ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Birds of prey, as top predators, play a key role in ecosystem functioning by regulating prey populations and, by means of cascade effects, promoting biodiversity. This makes them adequate sentinels of ecosystem health. Here we analyse the relationship between the occurrence of breeding short-toed snake eagle (Circaetus gallicus) and both the richness of potential prey species and landscape characteristics by taking into account two different spatial scales (i.e. nest-site scale and landscape scale). The short-toed snake eagle offers an interesting case study for investigating the relationships between top predators, prey diversity, and habitats, because it is an extremely specialised raptor that feeds on mesopredators, mostly snakes. Additionally, short-toed snake eagles are mainly threatened by changes in agriculture and land use in Europe, which have reduced the extent of suitable hunting habitats, and by the decrease in snake populations. Our study was conducted in the Latium Region (central Italy) in 2007, where most of the Italian breeding population is concentrated. By means of habitat selection analyses using generalised linear models, our results showed that the species selected breeding areas characterised by low elevations, rugged slopes, and high snake species richness at the nest-site scale (1km(2)). At the landscape scale (25km(2)), the best model showed that birds selected areas characterised by lower elevations for nesting, with a tendency towards intermediate values of wood cover and high snake species richness. Our study highlights the strong relationship between snake species richness and the occurrence of breeding eagles at both spatial scales, with optimal breeding sites located closer to hunting areas than expected by chance. This study provides further support for the role of short-toed snake eagles as sentinel species for Mediterranean habitats, and highlights the link between the location of nesting sites and the occurrence of human-modified landscapes characterised by high prey richness.

T2  - SIGNO Y SENA-REVISTA DEL INSTITUTO DE LINGUISTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses the influence of some contextual variables in the establishment of the Spanish number agreement between subject and verb in written texts by first year students of Industrial Engineering at Universidad Tecnologica Nacional, Argentina. In each case, the writing strategies and the way the student used to build a certain designated instance (the subject) in his/her own discourse were reviewed. This study is based on the notion of number proposed by Langacker (1991, 2), according to which the speaker always recognizes in a noun phrase, either singular or plural, a unit. We conducted a qualitative analysis on cases of syntactic discordance that involved not only morphological, syntactic and semantic aspects, but also pragmatic ones; given that from the Prototypical-Cognitive Approach (Lakoff 1987, Langacker, 2008) we consider grammar as a system of tendencies, which reflects the worldview of a society. By way of closure, we hold that it is necessary that who are dedicated to the field of education can understand the functioning of certain processing mechanisms of linguistic information that lead students to use grammatical forms considered not correct. The aforementioned will allow reflections between teachers and students in order to attain better results in their written productions.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the advantages of the Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) integrated with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in hydrologic modelling. Balci Stream Basin is selected as study area, lying within the boundaries of Borcka district of Artvin city in the northeast of Turkey.Types of data used in the study are as follows: LiDAR point cloud, Ground Control Points (GCPs) derived from Global Positioning System (GPS) in the field study and finally LANDSAT 8 satellite image for determination of land use. TerraScan, TerraModeler and TerraPhoto softwares are used in laser point cloud filtering, classification, modelling and accuracy analysis; while ArcGIS, Surfer, Global Mapper and Erdas Imagine softwares are used for integration with Geographic Information System and hydrologic modelling.Hydrologic modelling requires high resolution elevation data, with relevant vertical and horizontal accuracies and the basic data form for this is a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). For this purpose, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Digital Surface Model (DSM) and DTM were generated from classified LiDAR data with triangulation process, respectively. As a result of the modelling process LiDAR DTM represented the topography of Balci Stream Basin very accurately, which has a very steep slopped and dense vegetated character with a vertical accuracy of 0.1855 m., owing to the advantage of LiDAR: easily extraction of non-ground objects from the data. In the hydrologic modelling phase; LiDAR DTM was integrated with GIS and flood peak discharge value (Qp) was calculated. Resulting Qp value was quite close to the reference value.

AB  - Extreme conditions in the climate play an important role on the plant growth and yield of crops. Meteorological drought is one of these extreme climate conditions. In this study, 16 days photosynthetic activity of pistachios was investigated by integrating both field research and modern techniques (remote sensing and statistical methods). Furthermore, the effects of climatic factors on the yield of pistachio were analysed. Along with the present study, the relationships between pistachio and dry and wet climatic conditions were presented. According to the results of the drought analysis of both Birecik (a district in the south-eastern parts of Turkey) and Gaziantep (a province in the southeastern parts of Turkey) stations, pistachio is significantly affected by extreme climatic conditions. The photosynthetic activity of pistachio increased during the periods of wet climatic conditions.

AB  - Rapid urbanization with inadequate planning can have negative impact on the cities with growing population. Maintaining sustainable urban development and planning becomes one of the major necessity for the government and policy makers. Thus, being able to monitor the changes and the enlargement of the cities provides a valuable information for those decision-making bodies. This study investigates the possibilities of identifying the changed areas with Google Earth Engine (GEE) providing a fast and easy-to-use platform with its geospatial analysis tools for applications such as change detection. In this study, C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of Sentinel-1 and Multispectral Instrument (MSI) images of Sentinel-2 were utilized to identify the changed areas, such as new built-ups or soil excavation, of 21 neighborhood units of capital city of Turkey through GEE platform. The image subtraction of MSI images were integrated with image subtraction of SAR images of 2015 and 2017. The image indices such as Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Bare Soil Index (BSI) and Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) were also utilized. A binary supervised classification was performed by using Random Forest classifier. Finally, a post-processing with morphological operators was conducted to reduce the effects of pixel-based classification and to achieve higher test accuracy. With the post-processing, 91% overall test accuracy and kappa value of 0.82 were achieved. The study reveals an average of 5.9% change of the total area in those selected 21 neighborhood units of Ankara and Erler neighborhood unit is the most altered with 14.5% of its total area.

TI  - Integrating remote sensing and GIS techniques for monitoring and modeling shoreline evolution to support coastal risk management
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The precise delineation of coastal areas subject to past, present, and future erosive processes plays a fundamental role in coastal risk management. Within this framework, satellite data represent a valuable synoptic and multi-temporal information source. Therefore, this research integrated remote sensing and GIS techniques for mapping and modeling shoreline evolution through time. Long-term shoreline's proxy rates of advance and retreat were determined using Landsat data from the mid-1980s to 2011 and subsequently, a short-term scenario (3years) was predicted and validated. Two different coastal environments, Oceanic and Mediterranean, were investigated. In the first, different proxies were analyzed, thereby enabling a multi-proxy analysis. Findings showed that the method provided more accurate results in higher energy environments (Oceanic) and where the coastline is not urbanized. Results also highlighted the importance of performing multi-proxy analyses in given study areas, to more reliably define shoreline modeling. Importantly, during the analyses, particular attention was given to assessing uncertainty, which is crucial when outcomes of scientific research are considered for management.

TI  - Human Dignity as the Foundation of the Rule of Law in the Slovenian Society
T2  - BOGOSLOVNI VESTNIK-THEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY-EPHEMERIDES THEOLOGICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human dignity is a fundamental value of a democratic and the rule-of-law state, without which the rule of law cannot be established and fully excercised. The rule of law restricts the arbitrariness of state power and strong interest groups by protecting the dignity of the individual and society as a whole. Human dignity is not conditioned by the worldview of an individual, but belongs to him from the mere fact that he is a human being. It is thus directly linked to human life and the right to life and its realization. The rule of law is unconditionally linked to human dignity, since it regulates the functioning of a democratic and the rule-of-law state. The present contribution therefore addresses human dignity as the basis for the functioning of the rule of law. In the first part, human dignity is defined and analyzed as a cornerstone of the rule of law. The second part then presents and analyzes the case law of the Constitutional Court of Slovenia. The third part gives some suggestions for its concretization and improvement in the Slovenian society. Human dignity is the cornerstone of the rule of law, which every society must implement and protect in every way possible.

M3  - Data study
AB  - Data were collected to derive locational information of bushfire. The data consist of 88,281 Tweets.Reproducibility is widely regarded as crucial for scientific studies, yet there is still a lack of reproducibility in geospatial research. New sources of crowdsourced geoinformation provide new opportunities, but also complicate the reproducibility situation. Consequently, there is untapped potential in the domain of disaster response to reuse scientific methodology. Shared, executable scientific workflows can help in improving reproducibility. In this paper, we created reproducible scientific workflows for disaster response from three published studies using geosocial media sources. They have been adapted to a scientific workflow management system to investigate and evaluate their suitability for the creation of geospatial footprints of wildfire events from Twitter data. We investigated how scientific workflows adapt to various analytical processes and compared their performance using MODIS active fires data as ground truth. A systematic qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrated that scientific workflows can help increase the reproducibility of geospatial analytics.

AB  - The presence of phytoplankton in the oceans and freshwaters basins provides relevant ecological indications about water quality. Its abundance influences the interaction between the solar light and the water body, which in turn can be detected by remote sensing techniques. The water leaving light field contains information about all the processes that occur in the water body itself, including the complex interactions with phytoplankton. While elastic scattering is mostly ascribed to the phytoplankton surface, the absorption and fluorescence processes occur at the chlorophyll-a molecules level. Thus, measurements of the fluorescence signal emitted represents a suitable proxy to identify phytoplankton abundance in inland waters. In this context, the aim of this work is to establish and quantify how the fluorescence signal affects the Remote Sensing Reflectance (Rrs). For this purpose, radiative transfer simulations computed by Hydrolight code were generated for various levels of chlorophyll content, fluorescence quantum yield and optical properties, typical of a clear blue lake (Lake Garda, Italy). This work would form the basis for better exploiting satellite observations from upcoming hyperspectral missions (FLEX, PRISMA, Sentinel-1.0, HyspIRI).

AB  - RADARSAT-2 has now surpassed 10 years of routine Operations. The Spacecraft and the overall system continue to perform beyond their original design specifications. Payload availability and performance are maintained at such a high level thanks to the quality of the original design, careful system monitoring and continuous improvement. A variety of performance metrics are carefully trended by the Operations team, and key systems are continuously adjusted. The operational priorities have focused on expanding the capabilities of the mission in order to meet user demands, and to ensure that a high level of performance is achieved for years to come. Careful attention is paid to balancing risk management and the mission priorities. As a precursor to the upcoming RADARSAT Constellation Mission [1], RADARSAT-2 is expected to continue to deliver high quality and value products to its broad user community.

TI  - Mapping Soil Cation Exchange Capacity in a Semiarid Region through Predictive Models and Covariates from Remote Sensing Data
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - ABSTRACT: Planning sustainable use of land resources requires reliable information about spatial distribution of soil physical and chemical properties related to environmental processes and ecosystemic functions. In this context, cation exchange capacity (CEC) is a fundamental soil quality indicator; however, it takes money and time to obtain this data. Although many studies have been conducted to spatially quantify soil properties on various scales and in different environments, not much is known about interactions between soil properties and environmental covariates in the Brazilian semiarid region. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of random forest and cokriging models applied to predict CEC in the Brazilian semiarid region. The covariates used to predict CEC consist of images from Landsat 5 TM and a legacy soil map (scale 1:10,000). The sample set comprises 499 samples from the topsoil layer (0.00-0.20 m), where 375 samples were used in training processes and 124 as validation samples. The cokriging model (R2 = 0.57 and RMSE = 7.22 cmolc kg-1) performed better in predicting CEC than the random forest model (R2 = 0.47 and RMSE = 7.89 cmolc kg-1). The approach used showed potential for estimating CEC content in the Brazilian semiarid region by using covariates obtained from orbital remote sensing and the legacy soil map. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - SAR tomography for point-like and volumetric scatterers using a regularised iterative adaptive approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography has been shown to be an effective and important tool for the monitoring of infrastructures and the investigation of forest vertical structure. However, the existing tomographic imaging algorithms, including spectral estimation and compressive sensing, can only be applied to SAR dataset over urban areas or over vegetated areas, while providing superresolution capability and working on single-look interferometric data. In this study, we propose a tomographic processing algorithm for SAR tomography based on Tikhonov regularisation and iterative adaptive approach (IAA), referred to as RIAA. As a nonparametric spatial spectral estimation method, RIAA allows the application to scenarios with point-like scatterers as well as with volumetric scatterers. The proposed method also provides superresolution capability and works on single-look SAR images. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulated data, TerraSAR-X strip-map and BioSAR 2007 P-band datasets over the urban and forested areas, respectively.

AB  - Very high resolution (VHR) image scene classification is the most challenging of remote sensing data analysis, that has attracted researchers. attention. To improve the precision of VHR image scene classification, we propose a new method based on convolutional features extracted by convolutional neural network (CNN). First, Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG-Net) model is introduced as a feature extractor form the original VHR images. Second, we select the fifth convolutional layer constructed by VGG-Net, which is supposed as convolutional features descriptors. Third, based on Improved Fisher Vector (IFV) coding method, we compute the visual word corresponding to the convolutional features of the image scene. We conduct experiments on the public AID benchmark dataset, which contains 30 different areal categories with sub-meter resolution. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - The work done so far to evaluate automobile users' level of service (ALOS) were mostly based on the conditions observed in developed countries. As the traffic flow characteristics in developing countries are different in many ways, the objective of this study is to develop a suitable ALOS model to assess ALOS of urban streets for heterogeneous traffic flow conditions. To meet this objective, both traffic and geometric data were collected from 102 urban street segments of eight Indian cities. A perception survey was also carried out taking automobile drivers to assess the street service quality they perceive while driving. Several feed-forward back-propagation neural network models are developed using the significant variables found. Levenberg-Marquardt neural network (LMNN) model with linear activation function consisting of 10 neurons in the hidden layer is found to be the best-performing one having R-2 of 0.933 and RMSE of 0.1089, which is validated to check its suitability of determining ALOS.

TI  - Trends and Change-Point in Satellite Derived Phenology Parameters in Major Wheat Growing Regions of North India During the Last Three Decades
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The virtual certainty of the anticipated climate change will continue to raise many questions about its aggregated impact of environmental changes on our regional food security in imminent future. Crop responses to these changes are certain, but its exact characteristics are hardly understood at regional scale due to complex overlapping effects of climate change and anthropogenic manipulation of agro-ecosystem. This study derived phenology of wheat in north India from satellite data and analyzed trends of phenology parameters over last three decades. The most striking change-point period in phenology trends were also derived. The phenology was derived from two sources: (1) STAR-Global vegetation Health Products-NDVI, and (2) GIMMS-NDVI. The results revealed significant earliness in start of growing season (SOS) in Punjab and Haryana while delay was found in Uttar Pradesh (UP). End of the wheat season almost always occurred early, to even those place where SOS was delayed. Length of growing season increased in most of Punjab and northern Haryana whereas its decrease dominated in UP. The early sowing practice of the farmers of the Punjab and Haryana may be one of the adaptation strategies to manage the terminal heat stress in reproductive stage of the crop in the region. The change-point occurred in late 1990s (1998-2000) in Punjab and Haryana, while in eastern UP it was in early 1990s (1990-1995). Despite the difference in temporal aggregation and spatial resolution, both the datasets yielded similar trends, confirming both the robustness of the results and applicability of the datasets over the region. The results demands further research for proper attribution of the effects into its causes and may help devising crop adaption practices to climatic stresses.

TI  - Observational signatures of unusual outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and atmospheric gravity waves (AGW) as precursory effects of May 2015 Nepal earthquakes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquake preparation processes may start 1-30 days before its actual occurrence. Measurements of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and detection of the presence of atmospheric gravity waves (AGW) in very low frequency (VLF) radio signals can be used as tools to identify such processes. We studied these signals monitored prior to a recent major earthquake that occurred in Nepal at southeast of Kodari on May 12, 2015 at 12:50 pm local time (07:05 UTC) with Richter scale magnitude of M = 7.3 and depth 10 kin (6.21 miles). It was preceded by another major earthquake on April 25, 2015 with magnitude M = 7.9. First, to study the effects of seismic events on OLR, we used NOAA/IR daily (two degree gridded) data from April 16 to May 30, 2015 and followed the method of Eddy field calculation mean to find pre-seismic anomalies. We found singularities in Eddy field OLR curves around the earthquake epicenter starting 3 days prior to the earthquake days and disappearance of such singularities after the events. Such singularities can be associated with a large amount of energy released by the earthquakes. Second, we analyzed very low frequency (VLF) data recorded at Ionospheric and Earthquake Research Centre (IERC) of Indian Centre for Space Physics transmitted from JJI (22.2 kHz) station of Japan. We looked for the presence of atmospheric gravity waves in the ionosphere which can be considered as an important factor in finding seismo-ionospheric correlations. We performed both fast Fourier transform (FFT) and wavelet analysis on the signal and found significant presence of such waves (periods of almost 1 h) four days before the earthquake.

TI  - First report of the lesser wax moth <i>Achroia grisella</i> F. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) consuming polyethylene (silo-bag) in northwestern Argentin
T2  - JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this note, we report the lesser wax moth Achroia grisella F. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) (LWM), a beehive pest, for the first time in Argentina. In addition, we report observations of the larvae of this pest species consuming "silo-bags," a material commonly used in the country for hive management. Silo-bags are composed of three layers of polyethylene and one anti-UV layer and no records of insects consuming this material are found in the literature. Our report represents a warning for apiculture in Argentina, especially when honey production has been observed to decrease recently. This decrease may be a result of a combination of factors, which may include the poor monitoring of hive health, and inappropriate management of pests such as A. grisella. In addition, our observations on silo-bag consumption represent a call for attention to beekeepers that use this material to conserve heat in the hives and open questions about the mechanisms involved in silo-bag consumption by the larvae.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In the previous chapter, I added similarity-based signs or icons to the standard menu of referential options. In this chapter, I want to explore the ramifications of this addition for perception. Peirce saw good reason to push his prescissive analysis of iconicity down to a single quality. I thus contrast his account with that of John Poinsot, a medieval philosopher who held that a sign always retains a slight distinction between the object it signifies and the vehicle that does the signifying. Because iconic merger gives us a way to vindicate ordinary perception, I favour Peirce's stance. The resulting view goes against the claim, put forward by John Locke, that the "secondary" qualities we experience are mere figments. I therefore do my best to undermine that Lockean worldview. Although some philosophers believe that putting qualities back into the world results in panpsychism, I try to find a less far-fetched way to express this.

TI  - Geothermal Anomaly Mapping Using Landsat ETM plus Data in Ilan Plain, Northeastern Taiwan
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geothermal energy is an increasingly important component of green energy in the globe. A prerequisite for geothermal energy development is to acquire the local and regional geothermal prospects. Existing geophysical methods of estimating the geothermal potential are usually limited to the scope of prospecting because of the operation cost and site reachability in the field. Thus, explorations in a large-scale area such as the surface temperature and the thermal anomaly primarily rely on satellite thermal infrared imagery. This study aims to apply and integrate thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing technology with existing geophysical methods for the geothermal exploration in Taiwan. Landsat 7 (L7) Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery is used to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) in Ilan plain. Accuracy assessment of satellite-derived LST is conducted by comparing with the air temperature data from 11 permanent meteorological stations. The correlation coefficient of linear regression between air temperature and LST retrieval is 0.76. The MODIS LST product is used for the cross validation of Landsat derived LSTs. Furthermore, Landsat ETM+ multi-temporal brightness temperature imagery for the verification of the LST anomaly results were performed. LST Results indicate that thermal anomaly areas appear correlating with the development of faulted structure. Selected geothermal anomaly areas are validated in detail by field investigation of hot springs and geothermal drillings. It implies that occurrences of hot springs and geothermal drillings are in good spatial agreement with anomaly areas. In addition, the significant low-resistivity zones observed in the resistivity sections are echoed with the LST profiles when compared with in the Chingshui geothermal field. Despite limited to detecting the surficial and the shallow buried geothermal resources, this work suggests that TIR remote sensing is a valuable tool by providing an effective way of mapping and quantifying surface features to facilitate the exploration and assessment of geothermal resources in Taiwan.

TI  - Development and assessment of the SMAP enhanced passive soil moisture product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Launched in January 2015, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) observatory was designed to provide frequent global mapping of high-resolution soil moisture and freeze-thaw state every two to three days using a radar and a radiometer operating at L-band frequencies. Despite a hardware mishap that rendered the radar inoperable shortly after launch, the radiometer continues to operate nominally, returning more than two years of science data that have helped to improve existing hydrological applications and foster new ones.Beginning in late 2016 the SMAP project launched a suite of new data products with the objective of recovering some high-resolution observation capability loss resulting from the radar malfunction. Among these new data products are the SMAP Enhanced Passive Soil Moisture Product that was released in December 2016, followed by the SMAP/Sentinel-1 Active-Passive Soil Moisture Product in April 2017.This article covers the development and assessment of the SMAP Level 2 Enhanced Passive Soil Moisture Product (L2_SM_P_E). The product distinguishes itself from the current SMAP Level 2 Passive Soil Moisture Product (L2_SM_P) in that the soil moisture retrieval is posted on a 9 km grid instead of a 36 km grid. This is made possible by first applying the Backus-Gilbert optimal interpolation technique to the antenna temperature (T-A) data in the original SMAP Level 1B Brightness Temperature Product to take advantage of the overlapped radiometer footprints on orbit. The resulting interpolated TA data then go through various correction/calibration procedures to become the SMAP Level 1C Enhanced Brightness Temperature Product (L1C_TB_E). The L1C_TB_E product, posted on a 9 km grid, is then used as the primary input to the current operational SMAP baseline soil moisture retrieval algorithm to produce L2_SM_P_E as the final output. Images of the new product reveal enhanced visual features that are not apparent in the standard product. Based on in situ data from core validation sites and sparse networks representing different seasons and biomes all over the world, comparisons between L2_SM_P_E and in situ data were performed for the duration of April 1, 2015-October 30, 2016. It was found that the performance of the enhanced 9 km L2_SM_P_E is equivalent to that of the standard 36 km L2_SM_P, attaining a retrieval uncertainty below 0.040 m(3)/m(3) unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) and a correlation coefficient above 0.800. This assessment also affirmed that the Single Channel Algorithm using the V-polarized T-B channel (SCA-V) delivered the best retrieval performance among the various algorithms implemented for L2_SM_P_E, a result similar to a previous assessment for L2_SM_P.

TI  - Trend Detection for the Extent of Irrigated Agriculture in Idaho's Snake River Plain, 1984-2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding irrigator responses to changes in water availability is critical for building strategies to support effective management of water resources. Using remote sensing data, we examine farmer responses to seasonal changes in water availability in Idaho's Snake River Plain for the time series 1984-2016. We apply a binary threshold based on the seasonal maximum of the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) using Landsat 5-8 images to distinguish irrigated from non-irrigated lands. We find that the NDMI of irrigated lands increased over time, consistent with trends in irrigation technology adoption and increased crop productivity. By combining remote sensing data with geospatial data describing water rights for irrigation, we show that the trend in NDMI is not universal, but differs by farm size and water source. Farmers with small farms that rely on surface water are more likely than average to have a large contraction (over -25%) in irrigated area over the 33-year period of record. In contrast, those with large farms and access to groundwater are more likely than average to have a large expansion (over +25%) in irrigated area over the same period.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to understand the land use change and urban expansion of Jaipur City of Rajasthan (India). Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI satellite data of 4 years, i.e., 1993, 2000, 2010, and 2015 are used for land use and land surface temperature (LST) analysis. ERDAS Imagine and ArcGIS software are used to conduct the analysis. Urban settlement increased from 13.5 to 57.3% in the study period. Open land is mainly changed to urban areas. Urban settlement is also expanded to peri-urban area of Jaipur City. Jaipur City expanded along three directions i.e., north, west, and south and less development is found in the east direction. Based on radial analysis, it is observed there is not much development within the periphery of 2 km (close to city center) but maximum growth is observed within the distance from 4 to 6 km radius of city center. Expansion intensity was observed highest in the period 2015-2010 from 6 km onwards and reached to a maximum value close to 17 km(2)/year. In LST analysis, there is less change in extreme temperature, but more areal increase in average temperature range (30-35 degrees C). Urbanization is the main driving process of land cover changes and consequently changes in LST.

TI  - Study and analysis of efficient green cover types for mitigating the air temperature and urban heat island effect
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation has a dynamic relationship with land surface temperature (LST), which leads to urban heat island (UHI) effect. Madurai, a temple city in Tamilnadu, India has experienced rapid urbanisation that has been resulting in an UHI since 1990. This present study examines changes in LST as an indicator of UHI by analysing the changes in land use land cover (LULC) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). The analysis of these parameters indicates that higher LST is experienced in built up areas whereas lower LST is experienced in areas where green cover is more. This study further investigates the efficiency of various green cover types (trees and turfs) and optimum green plot ratio to mitigate air temperature by using Envi-met simulation software for the particular context. The findings of this study and further explorations on green spaces can be applied theoretically for improving urban planning and for mitigating the UHI effects.

TI  - Response Characteristics Analysis of Different Vegetation Indices to Leaf Area Index of Rice
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI), the most frequently used parameter for monitoring agricultural ecology, could be utilized to provide scientific basis for crop disease, growth and carbon cycle monitoring as well as yield estimation. Vegetation indices (VIs), which can be employed to indicate LAI, are important data sources for satellite-based LAI production. And the most widely used one is Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Several standard satellite LAI products such as MODIS use NDVI as an input. However, the saturation characteristics of NDVI would introduce errors in the production of LAI. To find a possible optimized VI to derive the LAI of rice, 28 sets of spectral observations and corresponding LAI data were collected in the sample fields of Jiangxi Province. Four commonly used VIs including NDVI, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) were extracted based on the in suit rice spectra. The response performance of the ground-based VIs to concurrent LAI measurements was assessed in this study. The linear regression results showed that the other three VIs had better adaptability than NDVI (R-2 =0. 38), while EVI had the best performance (R-2 =0. 82). MSAVI (R-2 =0. 744) and SAVI (R-2 =0. 751 1) also showed a better performance than NDVI. To continue, the differences between the results of ground-based model and the lookup table of MODIS LAI backup algorithm were compared. The MODIS LAI backup algorithm was derived from the empirical relationship between NDVI and LAI based on eight coarse biomass types. For biomass 1, it contained cereal and grass, and rice belonged to this category. In this paper, the lookup table of biomass 1 based on MODIS LAI backup algorithm was validated using the in situ LAI and spectral observations. The mean predict error of the algorithm was more than 3. 2; and mean relative tolerance was up to 530%. This means large error will be introduced in rice LAI monitoring of this area if we use MODIS LAI backup algorithm. The low accuracy of MODIS backup algorithm may be caused by the coarse biomass classification system. In fact, different vegetation types included in biomass 1 had very significant difference in their canopy characteristics. Mixing them all in one class would result in an unacceptable errors to the LAI inversion for a specified crop type such as rice. The different saturation ranges of NDVI to inverse the LAI were also considered. The NDVI values kept unchanged with the increase of LAI when LAI was greater than 4 in the MODIS backup algorithm. Nevertheless, for the regression based on the rice field measured LAI and spectral observations, the saturation domain of NDVI was reached when LAI was larger than 2. After that, the accuracy comparison of the four ground-based VI models implemented using root mean square error. The results showed that the mean predict error for NDVI model was 1. 019 and only 0. 55 for EVI model, which was only 1/6 of MODIS backup algorithm and 1/2 of NDVI model. Compared with the other three VIs, an addition blue band was utilized in the calculation of EVI to attenuate the aerosol impact on red band. This may be one of the possible reasons to explain the better performance of EVI. Therefore, an algorithm based on EVI could be developed as an alternative approach to improve the accuracy of LAI inversion.

AB  - The West African consciousness is predominant with the instrumental(pragmatical) realism which is applicable in common with value system and community centered on myth. Burkina Faso also keeps its identity with worldview and the formation of social value system which is based on myth and animism. To understand ‘the Catfish Myth’ in Bobo Dioulasso in Burkina Faso enables a missionary understanding by understanding identity and phenomena of deterministic community.For Bobo Dioulasso in Burkina Faso, Catfish is not only symbolic, but also a myth and a god. In addition, catfish is a value system that controls the spirit of the Bobo Dioulasso and an incarnation, and ‘the Catfish Myth’ is pure idealism and pure realism that makes clear the relationship between substance and knowledge systems. For them, catfish are not only objects of real faith but also important factors that determine the direction of life.The place of ‘the Catfish Myth’ is not only a sacred place for the Bobo, but also a place where ethnic society can be formed, and a place to bind ethnic communities. Their worship of catfish is not limited to the spirit worshiper, but rather all the Bobo regardless of their religions including Muslims and Protestants. Catfish is a divine being and is the object of worship and prayer for all the Bobo. Beyond the object of belief, ‘the Catfish Myth’ is the spiritual model of all life as well as the belief of the Bobo, and also it is the model of important divine ability in their lives. It can be understood that this myth originated from Africans’ intention to communicate through any real object rather than not be able to directly communicate with the spiritual being. In the end, the Bobo believes that catfish is a ‘divine being’ and an ‘omnipotent being’ through myths within this empirical position, and holds rituals to deep relationship with catfish as a being to guarantee and protect the future of individuals. This catfish myth shows that the Bobo is an organic community that combines the supernatural and the empirical worlds. The Catfish Myth also helps form close groups and lead social cooperation to be sustainable. Through this myth, family and community bonds are strengthened, and the myth naturally becomes reality by giving meaning to their lives.Thus, various transforming missions are necessary to understand the deterministic identity having the community of the Bobo and do missionary works. First of all, we need to practice the investment in people, and serve education and care to change mythical value system in various ways as well as continuing. It is also necessary to explore new missionary fields, and cooperate as a community with existing churches and missionary groups. Finally, it is necessary to present various missional models and build a missional system to change the attitude of the Bobo’s life that have already dominated their spirit and body.

TI  - Monitoring and Control of <i>Aedes albopictus</i>, a Vector of Zika Virus, Near Residences of Imported Zika Virus Patients during 2016 in South Korea
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus mainly transmitted by Aedes species. A total of nine of the 16 imported ZIKV reported cases during the mosquito season in the Republic of Korea (ROK), following the return of local nationals from foreign ZIKV endemic countries, were surveyed for Aedes albopictus. Surveillance and vector control of Ae. albopictus, a potential vector of ZIKV, and related species are critical for reducing the potential for autochthonous transmission in the ROK. Surveillance and vector control were coordinated by Korean Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC) and conducted by local health authorities within 200 m of imported ZIKV patients' residences. After diagnosis, thermal fogging (3 x week x 3 weeks), residual spray for homes and nearby structures (1 x week x 3 weeks), and larval control (3 x week x 3 weeks) were conducted in accordance with national guidelines developed by KCDC in early 2016. Of the nine residences surveyed using BG Sentinel traps, Ae. albopictus trap indices (TIs) for the three (3) patients' residences located near/in forested areas were significantly higher than the six patients' residences located inside villages/urban areas or low-lying farmland without trees. Overall, Ae. albopictus TIs in forested areas decreased by 90.4% after adult and larval control, whereas TIs decreased by 75.8% for residences in nonforested areas. A total of 3,216 Aedes and Ochlerotatus spp. were assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction for ZIKV, dengue, and chikungunya virus. Both species collected before and after vector control were negative for all viruses. Vector control within 200 m of residences of imported ZIKV patients, conducted in accordance with established guidelines, may have effectively reduced human-mosquito-human transmission cycle by competent vectors in South Korea.

The constellation observing system for meteorology, ionosphere, and climate and Formosa Satellite Mission 3 (COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3) radio occultation (RO) "wet" temperature product (i.e., "wetPrf") is used to analyze the Arctic air temperature profiles at 925-200 hPa in 2007-2012. The "wet" temperatures are further compared with radiosonde (RS) observations. The results from the spatially and temporally synchronized RS and COSMIC observations show that their temperatures agree well with each other, especially at 400 hPa. Comparisons of seasonal temperatures and anomalies from the COSMIC and homogenized RS observations suggest that the limited number of COSMIC observations during the spatial matchup may be insufficient to describe the smallscale spatial structure of temperature variations. Furthermore, comparisons of the seasonal temperature anomalies from the RS and 5A degrees x5A degrees gridded COSMIC observations at 400 hPa during the sea ice minimum (SIM) of 2007 and 2012 are also made. The results reveal that similar Arctic temperature variation patterns can be obtained from both RS and COSMIC observations over the land area, while extra information can be further provided from the densely distributed COSMIC observations. Therefore, despite COSMIC observations being unsuitable to describe the Arctic temperatures in the lowest level, they provide a complementary data source to study the Arctic upper-air temperature variations and related climate change.

TI  - A comparative analysis of the NDVIg and NDVI3g in monitoring vegetation phenology changes in the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Phenology is a sensitive and critical feature of vegetation and is a good indicator for climate change studies. The global inventory modelling and mapping studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been the most widely used data source for monitoring of the vegetation dynamics over large geographical areas in the past two decades. With the release of the third version of the NDVI (GIMMS NDVI3g) recently, it is important to compare the NDVI3g data with those of the previous version (NDVIg) to link existing studies with future applications of the NDVI3g in monitoring vegetation phenology. In this study, the three most popular satellite start of vegetation growing season (SOS) extraction methods were used, and the differences between SOSg and SOS3g arising from the methods were explored. The amplitude and the peak values of the NDVI3g are higher than those of the NDVIg curve, which indicated that the SOS derived from the NDVIg (SOSg) was significantly later than that derived from the NDVI3g (SOS3g) based on all the methods, for the whole northern hemisphere. In addition, SOSg and SOS3g both showed an advancing trend during 1982-2006, but that trend was more significant with SOSg than with SOS3g in the results from all three methods. In summary, the difference between SOSg and SOS3g (in the multi-year mean SOS, SOS change slope and the turning point in the time series) varied among the methods and was partly related to latitude. For the multi-year mean SOS, the difference increased with latitude intervals in the low latitudes (0-30 degrees N) and decreased in the mid- and high-latitude intervals. The GIMMS NDVI3g data-sets seemed more sensitive than the GIMMS NDVIg in detecting information about the ground, and the SOS3g data were better correlated both with the in situ observations and the SOS derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer NDVI. For the northern hemisphere, previous satellite measures (SOS derived from GIMMS NDVIg) may have overestimated the advancing trend of the SOS by an average of 0.032dyr(-1).

AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites have successfully operated since their launch in 1999 and in 2002, providing more than 18 and 16 years of continuous global observations, respectively. The inter-comparison between the two MODIS instruments can be very supportive for the instrument calibration and uncertainty assessment. Aqua and Terra MODIS have almost identical relative spectral response, spatial resolution, and dynamic range for each band. Therefore, a site dependent correction for a sensor spectral band pair is not necessary for their comparison. However, Terra is in the morning orbit with an equator crossing time of 10:30 am, and Aqua is in the afternoon orbit with equator crossing time of 1:30 pm. Consequently, there is a dearth of simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNOs) between the two satellites. Major challenges in cross-sensor comparison of instruments on different satellites include differences in observation time, solar angle, and view angle over selected pseudo-invariant sites. In this work, the inter-comparisons of thermal emissive bands are performed over a pseudo-invariant target, using the observations from a sensor onboard a geostationaly satellite as a bridge. Himawari8 was launched on October 7, 2014. The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari8 can be used as a reference to bridge the comparison between Terra and Aqua MODIS. AHI has 16 channels; with spatial resolutions from 0.5 km to 2 km at nadir and produces a full disk observations every 10 minutes. The band spectral coverage matchup, comparable spatial resolution and near-simultaneous observation between MODIS and AHI provide feasibility to implement a double difference method. This comparison method minimizes the impact of the difference in observation time and solar angle. The comparison results will be used as an assessment for MODIS instrument calibration and will be helpful for future enhancement of the L1B product.

AB  - Terra MODIS has provided continuous global observations for science research and applications for more than 18 years. The MODIS Thermal emissive bands (TEB) radiometric calibration uses a quadratic function for instrument response. The calibration coefficients are updated using the response of an on-board blackbody (BB) in quarterly warm-up and cool-down (WUCD) events. As instrument degradation and electronic crosstalk of long-wave infrared (LWIR) bands 27 to 30 developed substantial issues, accurate calibration is crucial for a high-quality L1B product. The on-board BB WUCD temperature ranges from 270 K to 315 K and the derived nonlinear response has a relatively large uncertainty for the offset, especially for these LWIR bands, which affects the measurements of low brightness temperature (BT) scenes.In this study, the TEB radiometric calibration impact on the L1B product is assessed using selected cold targets and the measurements during regular lunar rolls. The cold targets include Antarctic Dome Concordia (Dome-C) and deep convective clouds (DCC) for the calibration assessment, focusing on bands 27 to 30. Dome-C area is covered with uniformly-distributed permanent snow, and the atmospheric effect is small and relatively constant. Usually the DCC is treated as an invariant earth target to evaluate the reflective solar band calibration. The DCC can also be treated as a stable target to assess the performance of TEB calibration. During a scheduled lunar observation event with a spacecraft roll maneuver to view the moon through the space view port, the instrument cavity provides a stable reference for calibration assessment. The long-term trending of BT measurements and the relative difference between scan mirror sides and detectors are used for the assessment of the calibration consistency and stability. The comparison of L1B products over the selected targets before and after the calibration coefficients update can be used to assess the impact of a calibration look-up table (LUT) update. This assessment is beneficial for future calibration algorithm and LUT update procedure improvements for enhancing the L1B product quality.

AB  - Semantic Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision and remote sensing imagery. Many applications, such as urban planning, change detection, and environmental monitoring, require the accurate segmentation; hence, most segmentation tasks are performed by humans. Currently, with the growth of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), there are many works aiming to find the best network architecture fitting for this task. However, all of the studies are based on very-high resolution satellite images, and surprisingly; none of them are implemented on medium resolution satellite images. Moreover, no research has applied geoinformatics knowledge. Therefore, we purpose to compare the semantic segmentation models, which are FCN, SegNet, and GSN using medium resolution images from Landsat-8 satellite. In addition, we propose a modified SegNet model that can be used with remote sensing derived indices. The results show that the model that achieves the highest accuracy RGB bands of medium resolution aerial imagery is SegNet. The overall accuracy of the model increases when includes Near Infrared (NIR) and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) band. The results showed that our proposed method (our modified SegNet model, named RGB-IR-IDX-MSN method) outperforms all of the baselines in terms of mean F1 scores.

TI  - The effect of a commercial competitive exclusion product on the selection of enrofloxacin resistance in commensal <i>E-coli</i> in broilers
T2  - AVIAN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of a competitive exclusion product (Aviguard (R)) on the selection of fluoroquinolone resistance in poultry was assessed in vivo in the absence or presence of fluoroquinolone treatment.Two experiments using a controlled seeder-sentinel animal model (2 seeders: 4 sentinels per group) with one-day-old chicks were used. For both experiments, as soon as the chicks were hatched, the birds of two groups were administered Aviguard (R) and two groups were left untreated. Three days later, all groups were inoculated with an enrofloxacin-susceptible commensal E. coli strain. Five days after hatching, two birds per group were inoculated with either a bacteriologically fit or a bacteriologically non-fit enrofloxacin-resistant commensal E. coli strain. In experiment 2, all groups were orally treated for three consecutive days (days 8-10) with enrofloxacin. Throughout the experiments, faecal excretion of all inoculated E. coli strains was determined on days 2, 5, 8, 11, 18 and 23 by selective plating (via spiral plater). Linear mixed models were used to assess the effect of Aviguard (R) on the selection of fluoroquinolone resistance.The use of Aviguard (R) (P < 0.01) reduced the excretion of enrofloxacin-resistant E. coli when no enrofloxacin treatment was administered. However, this beneficial effect disappeared (P = 0.37) when the birds were treated with enrofloxacin. Similarly, bacterial fitness of the enrofloxacin-resistant E. coli strain used for inoculation had an effect (P < 0.01) on the selection of enrofloxacin resistance when no treatment was administered, whereas this effect was no longer present when enrofloxacin was administered (P = 0.70).Thus, enrofloxacin treatment cancelled the beneficial effects from administrating Aviguard (R) in one-day-old broiler chicks and resulted in an enrofloxacin-resistant flora.RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTSThe effect of Aviguard (R) on the selection of enrofloxacin resistance was assessed in vivo.Without enrofloxacin, Aviguard (R) reduced the selection of enrofloxacin resistance.When enrofloxacin was administered, it cancelled the beneficial effect of Aviguard (R).

AB  - It's difficult to retrieve low to moderate wind speeds from Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data at cross-polarization because of low signal to noise ratio. In this paper, we proposed a new approach for retrieving sea surface low to moderate wind speeds utilizing C-band dual-polarized SAR observations from the Sentinel-1. Dual-polarized SAR images and in situ buoy winds were collected and used to analyze the relations of the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) with the sea surface wind speed and incidence angle. The cross-polarized NRCS is hardly dependent on wind speed under 5m/s but is strongly dependent on incidence. Finally, a new cost function which combines co- and cross-polarized geophysical model functions was proposed. The resulting bias of -0.9 m/s and correlation coefficient of 0.846 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cost function for wind speed under 20m/s. Furthermore, comparisons show that low wind speed retrieval from cross-polarized SAR data is hard, but it can contribute to that from co-polarized SAR

AB  - The ecosystem science requirements for the NASA ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) will need to be validated after its launch in 2021 [1]. NASA has also been conducting a major field campaign in the boreal region of North America called the Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) [2]. ABoVE presents an opportunity to establish critical Cal/Val sites for the NISAR mission, as requirements for estimating biomass under 100 t/ha, detecting disturbance in forested areas, delineation of wetland inundation, and measuring permafrost deformation must be validated in the boreal region. Here, we describe preliminary analysis of field measurements collected as part of ABoVE against a time series of C-band SAR data from the ESA Sentinel-1 satellites.

TI  - Improving ground cover monitoring for wind erosion assessment using MODIS BRDF parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring and monitoring controls on wind erosion can facilitate detection and prediction of soil degradation important for food security. Ground cover is widely recognised as an important factor for controlling soil erosion by wind and water. Consequently, maintaining ground cover (e.g., vegetation, crop canopy, crop residue) is a recommended management practice which is widely adopted by farmers and land owners. Wind erosion is a lateral or horizontal process and the amount of ground cover needed to maintain lateral cover (L-c = nbh/S where n roughness elements occupy ground area S and have b and h mean breadth and height, respectively) is not well established. Soil may be removed from beneath or between crop and natural vegetation canopies depending on the width, height and distribution of cover types relative to wind direction and strength. Monitoring by repeated measurement or estimation of ground cover provides information to develop an understanding of its spatial and temporal variation. Fractional cover (f(c)) retrieved from optical satellite remote sensing (e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; MODIS) provides a consistent and repeatable measure of ground cover when viewed from above. Therefore, f(c) provides an areal assessment of components of ground cover. Fractional cover is consequently not the most appropriate approximation of the protection of the soil from wind erosion. Extant wind erosion model parameterisations of L-c already benefit from the use of satellite-derived cover data (L-fc). However, the parameterisations are not well developed. Here, we address the need for a dynamic (multi temporal), moderate resolution and global metric for wind erosion assessment and modelling. We demonstrate the benefits of using L-c within the context of monitoring ground cover for the assessment of wind erosion and review the basis for estimating ground cover using L-c. We describe a new method for an albedo-based approximation of aerodynamic sheltering (L-omega). We use ray-casting of rough surfaces from an existing wind tunnel study to establish a relation between measured L, and directional hemispherical reflectance omega(dir)(0(center dot), lambda), the so-called 'black-sky albedo' and its inverse to estimate shadow. The relation is confirmed to be dependent on the solar zenith angle (theta) and spectral (lambda) confounding factors (e.g., soil moisture, soil mineralogy). We reduced the A. dependency of omega(dir)(0(center dot), lambda) by normalising with the MODIS (MCD43A1) BRDF parameter A to estimate albedo-based lateral cover (L-omega) globally over space (500 m pixels) and time (every 8 days). We compared L-omega with f(c) and L-fc over time for selected locations in Australia and examined L-omega across Australia and the USA using national biogeographic regions. Consistent with current approaches to estimating L-c our results were not field validated due to the dearth of ground-based measurements. However, our results demonstrate that L-omega will improve wind erosion models particularly over large areas and L-omega, is likely to be a valuable source of decision-support information to guide policy makers and land managers on where, when and how to reduce wind erosion.

T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - In primary breast cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy has been established as the gold standard for regional axillary staging. A robust body of randomized data support its accuracy and safety in patients with early, clinically node negative disease. However, the role of SLNB remains debatable in various patient subgroups, and recent advances in histopathology, dedicated axillary ultrasound imaging and chemotherapy regimens, put its role under a new perspective. Herein, we review the current literature data on the indications for SLNB and discuss the challenges in management germane to special patient subgroups and patterns of disease. We also present emerging data on the optimal management of the SLN+ patient, in light of recent trials challenging the dogma of completion axillary dissection after a positive sentinel node biopsy.

AB  - We consider the problem of unwrapping the phase of synthetic aperture radar interferograms. Like several existing approaches, we use an estimate of the gradient of the interferogram phase. Our contribution is to regularize this differentiation process, in a manner that both suppresses noise and allows the estimate to be discontinuous. This allows us to preserve the elevation information present in the phase data, without smoothing away the discontinuities created by phase wrapping. We demonstrate the differentiation with a simple phase unwrapping approach, and apply it to an example inter-ferogram computed from Sentinel-1 image data.

TI  - Geospatial Technologies for Semiautomated Baseline Database Generation for Large-Scale Land Resource Inventory
T2  - GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGIES IN LAND RESOURCES MAPPING, MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The goal of land resource inventory is to enable the lab-to-land transfer of agro-technology on a sustainable basis through identification of homogeneous soil management units. The identification of homogeneous landscape ecological unit (LEU) boundaries for soil mapping through conventional methods is time-consuming and laborious. Hence, it is necessary to develop a semiautomated geospatial framework for delivering reliable soil resource information to the users on time. In the present chapter, the approach for semiautomation in landform delineation using high-resolution IRS Cartosat-1 and LISS-IV data was discussed. Cartosat-1 stereopair data are processed to generate the digital terrain model (DTM) of 10 m spatial resolution. The digital terrain analysis was carried out to generate contour, drainage, slope, and hillshade for landform delineation in two distinct terrain conditions. Object-based slope classification algorithm is developed by following USDA-NRCS slope class thresholds to hasten the process of landform identification. The land use/ land cover (LULC) map of the area is generated based on the rabi season data of Cartosat-1 merged LISS-IV (2.5 m) as well as high-resolution (0.5 m) public domain imagery at the backend so as to get the reliable land use boundary at cadastral level through feature optimization algorithm in eCognition software using near-infrared (NIR) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. The integration of three secondary layers, i.e., landform, slope, and LULC, are achieved through the hierarchical object-based segmentation algorithm to develop landscape ecological unit (LEU) map. The logical automation algorithm developed at each stage assists in optimizing sampling intensity, which leads to a considerable saving of man power, labor, cost, and time.

AB  - The management of patients with diffuse invasive conjunctival melanoma focuses on local tumor control and screening for metastasis. Despite the lack of consensus on the benefit of sentinel lymph node biopsy for these neoplasms, the information obtained by histopathology is useful for tumor staging and treatment planning. Due to the lack of evidence of survival improvement, orbital exenteration is being performed with diminishing frequency. We describe a patient with diffuse invasive conjunctival melanoma and lymph node involvement treated by tumor debulking, brachytherapy (custom unshielded radioactive device), and adjuvant ipilimumab who has had a favorable outcome without emergence of local tumor relapse or distant metastasis during 16 months of follow up.

M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide susceptibility map aids decision makers and planners for the prevention and mitigation of landslide hazard. This study presents a methodology for the generation of landslide susceptibility mapping using remote sensing data and Geographic Information System technique for the part of the Darjeeling district, Eastern Himalaya, in India. Topographic, earthquake, and remote sensing data and published geology, soil, and rainfall maps were collected and processed using Geographic Information System. Landslide influencing factors in the study area are drainage, lineament, slope, rainfall, earthquake, lithology, land use/land cover, fault, valley, soil, relief, and aspect. These factors were evaluated for the generation of thematic data layers. Numerical weight and rating for each factor was assigned using the overlay analysis method for the generation of landslide susceptibility map in the Geographic Information System environment. The resulting landslide susceptibility zonation map demarcated the study area into four different susceptibility classes: very high, high, moderate, and low. Particle Swarm Optimization-Support Vector Machine technique was used for the prediction and classification of landslide susceptibility classes, and Genetic Programming method was used to generate models and to predict landslide susceptibility classes in conjunction with Geographic Information System output, respectively. Genetic Programming and Particle Swarm Optimization-Support Vector Machine have performed well with respect to overall prediction accuracy and validated the landslide susceptibility model generated in the Geographic Information System environment. The efficiency of the landslide susceptibility zonation map was also confirmed by correlating the landslide frequency between different susceptible classes.

AB  - This paper introduces the topic of urban change detection by means of fully and dual polarized multitemporal spaceborne SAR data. The aim is to be able to detect not only urban extent expansion/shrinking phenomena, but changes that may affect both the two-and the three-dimensional landscape. For fully polarized SAR, we further validate and refine a recently introduced approach based on superpixel segmentation followed by the computation of selected polarimetric parameters and the analysis of the difference among feature vectors using specialized distance metrics. As for dual polarized SAR data, a combination of interferometric and polarimetric features within the same framework is proved to perform decently, but no real advantage if using polarimetry is obtained. Test cases using UAVSAR and Sentinel-1 data are presented in support of the proposed techniques.

TI  - Innovations in image-guided preoperative breast lesion localization
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Screening mammography increases detection of non-palpable breast lesions requiring image-guided localization prior to surgery. Accurate preoperative localization is crucial for successful surgical outcomes. Wire-guided localization is currently the most widely used localization method for non-palpable breast lesions; however, this technique has multiple disadvantages including patient discomfort, possible wire transection and migration, suboptimal surgical incision placement due to wire location and limited scheduling flexibility decreasing operating room efficiency. As a result, promising new techniques including radioactive seed localization, non-radioactive radar localization and magnetic seed localization have been developed as alternatives. In this article, we provide an overview of these techniques and discuss their advantages, drawbacks and currently available outcome data.

AB  - The continuous generation of huge amount of remote sensing (RS) data is becoming a challenging task for researchers due to the 4 Vs characterizing this type of data (volume, variety, velocity and veracity). Many platforms have been proposed to deal with big data in RS field. This paper focus on the comparison of two well-known platforms of big RS data namely Hadoop and Spark. We start by describing the two platforms Hadoop and Spark. The first platform is designed for processing enormous unstructured data in a distributed computing environment. It is composed of two basic elements : 1) Hadoop Distributed file system for storage, and 2) Mapreduce and Yarn for parallel processing, scheduling the jobs and analyzing big RS data. The second platform, Spark, is composed by a set of libraries and uses the resilient distributed data set to overcome the computational complexity. The last part of this paper is devoted to a comparison between the two platforms.

AB  - Currently, lots of work is being done to improve the accuracy of navigation systems both from the hardware point of view [1-6] and from the software [7-11]. No less important issue is development of a single system within hardware and software complexes [12-14]. In this article we reveal the issues solving the navigation-temporal tasks in different coordinate systems. When creating multichannel GNSS receivers that implement interferometric methods for measuring spatial orientation on GLONASS and GPS signals, it is extremely important to solve navigation and time problems, especially in order to optimize the solution with missing satellite data. The article also presents proposals for the improvement of multichannel GNSS receivers in order to solve the problems of positioning in conditions of uncertainty and incompleteness of data.

AB  - Coffee leaf chlorophyll (Chl) is an important proxy for coffee plant photosynthetic rates, nitrogen content, leaf health and yield potential. Whereas the recently launched Sentinel 2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI) data has great potential for plant condition assessment, the value of its spectral settings at variable spatial resolutions in relation to crop canopy cover on Chl content prediction remains largely unexplored. In this study, we apply an empirical model to estimate coffee leaf Chl with Sentinel 2 MSI data. Results showed that coffee biophysical parameters (height and canopy cover) are significantly influenced by stand age while plant water concentration and total Chl are age invariant. Results further showed that the best modelling results (R-2=0.69, RMSE=64.4) were achieved when all the bands at 10m spatial resolution with all data were used. We concluded that Sentinel 2 MSI is a valuable dataset for predicting coffee leaf Chl, however, based on our findings, we suggest that finer spatial resolutions of 10m on mature coffee stands should be adopted for better prediction results.

AB  - The Satellite data have been more and more used in ocean forecast. They can be used not only in ocean forecast validation but also be assimilated in ocean forecast model. Since August 2011, the HY-2 satellite has been launched successfully, and now it has been used in ocean wind model. This paper is armed to use the WindSat Sea Surface Wind (SSW) data to validate the accuracy of wind forecast, which has assimilated the HY-2 Scatterometer (SCAT) SSW. Compared with HY-2 SSW, the validation results show that the accuracy of forecast wind speed improved 0.18 m/s with the accuracy of wind direction improved 0.59 degrees after assimilating HY-2 SCAT SSW into Model, and the RE cannot accurately describe the SSW accuracy assessment.

T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Urban Agglomeration in Yangtze River Delta is one of the most important economic and industrial regions in China. The City of Changzhou is one of the most important industrial citys in Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration. Activities here include groundwater exploration. Groundwater overexploitation has contributed to the major land deformation in this city. The severity and magnitude of land deformation over time were investigated in Changzhou City. A Small Baseline Subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology, provides a useful tool in measuring urban land deformation. In this study, a time series of COSMO-SkyMed and Sentinel-1A SAR images covering Changzhou City were acquired. SBAS-InSAR imaging technique was used to survey the extent and severity of land deformation associated with the exploitation of groundwater in Changzhou City. Leveling data was used to validate the SBAR-InSAR productions, the error of SBAR-InSAR annual subsidence results was within 2 mm. The results showed that three main land subsidence zones were detected at Xinbei, Tianning and Wujin District. Four subsidence points were selected to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of land subsidence. The subsidence rate of P1 to P4 was -2.48 mm/year, -12.78 mm/year, -18.09 mm/year, and -12.69 mm/year respectively. Land subsidence over Changzhou showed a trend of slowing down from 2011 to 2017, especially in Wujin District. SBAR-InSAR derived land deformation that correlates with the water level change in six groundwater stations. Indicated that with groundwater rebound, the land rebound obviously, and the maximum rebound vale reached 9.13 mm.

TI  - Impacts of radiometric calibration on land surface temperature retrieval over urban areas

CP  - 5th International Workshop on Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Applications (EORSA)
CL  - Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - In this paper, the impact of radiometric calibration on land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from a single thermal channel, particularly over urban areas, was investigated. To measure the impact, an error coefficient (EC) was defined as the ratio of LST error to radiometric calibration uncertainty. The EC was estimated based on a sensitivity model, with focusing on HJ-1B thermal channel. Generally, under a moderate condition, a 0.1 (Wm(-2).sr(-1).mu m(-1)) uncertainty in radiometric calibration may result in an error of 1.1 K in LST retrieval. Further investigations on the spatial and temporal variations of EC were based on MODIS/Terra MOD11_C3 and MOD08_M3 as well as a yearly land cover product (MCD12_C1). In addition, discussions for urban areas were demonstrated. Major findings include: (1) the EC over urban areas located in low latitudes are larger than those in middle latitudes; (2) seasonal variation of the ECs over urban is visible, which is associated with the backgrounds of geography and climatology; (3) the EC differences between urban and non-urban vary spatially and temporally, which show significant contribution to LST retrieval, especially over the transition region of middle and low latitudes.

TI  - Unique performance of spaceborne SAR remote sensing in cultural heritage applications: Overviews and perspectives
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - To be an innovative remote sensing technology, spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is increasingly recognized as an irreplaceable tool in cultural heritage applications, such as archaeological prospection for the discovery of new sites and monument monitoring and management, taking advantage of observation capabilities independent of sun illumination and weather conditions. In this paper, we firstly give a synoptic overview for the state-of-art of spaceborne SAR technology in cultural heritage applications. Then, the unique performance of SAR compared with optical approaches, including subsurface imaging and interferometry, is objectively exploited and assessed using simulations and case studies. Simulations indicated that long wavelength SAR is promising in the detection of relics with an extended geometric dimension, particularly when the performance of tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) in subsurface imaging is optimized. However, case studies proved that interferometic SAR (InSAR) is useful for landscape archaeology by producing digital elevation models as well as for risk monitoring and preventive diagnosis of cultural properties using motion indicators. This study showed the potentialities of spaceborne SAR applications in cultural heritage, with particular reference to TomoSAR and differential TomoSAR (D-TomoSAR).

AB  - In this paper, used MODIS satellite image (MOD13) for monitoring the progress of flood in Mekong River Basin and testing the flood forecasting method for the Mekong Delta in flooding stage of 2015. The results showed that (80% reliability): MODIS image can be used to monitor the progress of flood in large areas of the Mekong River Basin. There was a close relationship between enhanced vegetation index EVI, land surface water index LSWI with growth status of plants and surface water of the flood. Risk flood maps during the flood season of the study area were established as the basis for developing the flood forecasting method applied to the Mekong Delta. With accuracy about 91%, this flood forecast method opened a new direction for researching about environmental disasters using the resource of satellite image at low cost. Therefore, it should use these images for monitoring the process, forecasting flood capability and other related fields in combination with other types of vegetation indices.

AB  - Kangding Airport, Sichuan, China located on the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has been developed in rugged terrain. The airport environment is characterized by high filling of earth materials, high frequencies and intensities of seismic activities, and high altitude. The understanding of potential risk of the 3-high airport assessed by the surface deformation is of vital importance. In this study, the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) and Quasi Persistent Scatterer (QPS) techniques were used and proven to be effective to quantify the long-term surface deformation of the airport. The deformation was highly correlated with the local geological settings and annual climate cycle.

AB  - This paper presents a new building indicator based on the multi-angle images, the angular difference feature (ADF), which characterizes angular properties from high-resolution ZY-3 multi-view images. The method for detecting buildings based on ADF consists of two main steps: ADF feature extraction and a post-processing step to refine the results by simultaneously incorporating the spectral and geometrical information. Experiments are conducted with three ZY-3 images acquired over Chinese cities. The proposed ADF achieves promising building detection performance over both highly dense urban areas and suburban areas, with an overall accuracy of better than 89% for all the three data sets.

TI  - Trend forecast based approach for cropland change detection using Lansat-derived time-series metrics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on cropland changes is critical for understanding greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, food safety, and human welfare. Traditional bi-temporal change detection methods using remotely sensed imagery may generate pseudochanges due to phenological differences and interference factors. In this study, we develop the Trend Forecast-based change detection approach (TFCD) using Landsat-derived time-series metrics to eliminate pseudochanges caused by phenological differences. Assuming that time-series images could be modelled and analysed, the time-series model would have a high capacity for revealing trends and temporal patterns. The spectral variability of cropland has strong seasonal dynamics, which shows short-period regular changes and long-term dynamic trends. Therefore, multi-harmonic model is used to describe the trend and temporal patterns of cropland over time. Then, the differences between model predicted and observed trajectory are used to detect the change areas. Finally, the change types are determined using the model coefficients. The effectiveness of this method was verified using a stack of (25 images) Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Operational Land Imager images from two years (2014 and 2015). The results indicated that TFCD correctly detected true changes, with 95.79% overall accuracy and a Kappa coefficient of 0.751, and that the method was superior to the traditional methods.

TI  - Using geochemical data for prospecting target areas by the sequential maximum angle convex cone method in the Manzhouli area, China
T2  - GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Prospecting target areas generally involves a comprehensive analysis of the geological prospecting criteria or the use of mathematical methods to extract comprehensive prospecting information to compare with the known ore deposits. Geochemical survey data have played an important role for prospecting target areas. However, most target areas are large, their locations are not specific, and the data are mostly based on the main ore-forming elements and ignore the contribution of other geochemical elements. This study rasterizes geochemical data at a scale of 1:200,000 in the Manzhouli area and prepares a geochemical image atlas with a spatial resolution of 1 km using the hyperspectral remote sensing data processing method. The sequential maximum angle convex cone (SMACC) spectral tool is used to identify favorable regions of rock formation, to classify enrichment zones of metallogenic elements in combination with the mineralization intensity of the main ore-forming elements on the surface, and to generate an ore prospecting target area classification map. Our results show that some of the areas known to have ore deposits, including the Wunugetushan, Babayi, and Badaguan copper molybdenum deposits in the Manzhouli area, fall into the potential target area, which demonstrates the accuracy of our proposed method in prospecting target areas. Therefore, this method can be used to accurately identify ore targets based on comprehensive geochemical data.

AB  - More and more researchers are using remote sensing technology to measure real-world, on-road automobile emissions of nitric oxide (NO), one of the most important and frequently studied pollutants. Partnered with the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New Zealand, we aim to establish a robust NO emission factor prediction model using remote sensing data to forecast future emissions. This model can be extremely useful to local transport authorities for monitoring urban pollution levels and validating the effectiveness of existing traffic control policies. We have conducted this research using real-world data that were collected over a 10-year span between 2005 and 2015. The experimental results have shown that the vehicle emission patterns are continuously changing and the relevance of remote sensing data for future predictions decays as they get older.We propose a 3-step machine learning approach to establish this model. Most notably we use quantile regression forest (a variation of random forest) as the base algorithm and use random forest's variable importance measure to validate and interpret the features. The model yields error rates that compare favourably to linear model based recursive partitioning and the original random forest model.

AB  - In this study, the Sentinel-2A Bottom Of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance imageries over Beijing area from Dec 2016 to Nov 2017 were generated by the Sen2Cor processor and evaluated using the AERONET measurements and the 6SV code. The result shows a poor correlation between the Sen2Cor retrieved AOT and the ground data with R = 0.289 possibly because of the limitation of the AOT algorithm. The errors of Sen2Cor retrieved AOT and water vapor pressure have a great effect on the BOA reflectance and spectral indices such as NDVI. The highest relative uncertainty of the Sen2Cor BOA reflectance is 37.76% for B01 and the lowest correlation is 0.859 for B09. The result also shows that a high-accuracy atmospheric correction is still crucial and urgent for the Sentinel-2A data.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Retrieval and Result Analysis Based on Landsat Imagery in Dianchi basin

AB  - Surface temperature is an important indicator for the global environment analysis, and remote sensing technology has been widely used for surface temperature retrieval. At present, the main algorithms for surface temperature retrieval include: Radiance Transfer Equation (RTE), Mono-window Algorithm (MWA), Sub-pixel Decomposition Techniques. However, these algorithms' comparative analyses are insufficient. In this paper, according to the above limitation, the Dianchi Lake Basin as study area and Landsat-5/7/8 satellite remote sensing images as the main date sources, the three algorithms are used to complete surface temperature retrieval and analyze the differences. Finally, the retrieved results' accuracies of different algorithms were verified using land surface temperature of daytime (LTD) data. The results showed that: (1) The correlation coefficient of the three algorithms retrieved results with LTD were both higher than 0.75. The similarity coefficient between the retrieved land surface temperature results of three algorithms were greater than 0.98, both of them could represent the spatial distribution of surface temperature and the differences of different underlying surfaces. (2) The correlation between the results of the radiance transfer equation method and LTD reached 0.804 (Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS), which was suitable for high-precision surface temperature analysis. (3) The mono-window method used atmospheric transmittance and atmospheric average temperature to participate in the calculation, which could retrieve the surface temperature quickly and effectively. (4) The emissivity modulation (EM) method could retrieve the surface temperature effectively by adjusting the emissivity, and the correlation coefficient between its results with the LTD data reached 0.8003 for Landsat-8 OLI / TIRS image. The emissivity modulation method only needs to calculate the surface emissivity before it can retrieve the surface temperature with known parameters. It's suitable for the surface temperature retrieval using remote sensing data before 2000 years and the automatic surface temperature extraction of large-scale remote sensing data.

AB  - At present, high spatial resolution remote sensing images have been widely applied in the ground objects classification. However, the information extraction of typical opencast mining areas by using high spatial resolution remote sensing images is less studied. The open-pit Nonoc nickel mine is one of the largest laterites nickel ore in Philippines. In this paper, based on the data resource of high spatial resolution remote sensing images, we used the method of object-oriented classification with hierarchical multi-scale segmentation to extract ground object information in the Nonoc nickel mining areas. The qualitatively and quantitatively relative analysis between single scale and hierarchical multi-scale identification results shows that hierarchical multi-scale segmentation has better effect and the highest precise, and the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient are 92.73% and 0.9024 respectively. Consequently the hierarchical multi-scale segmentation method is more suitable to be applied to the information extraction of open-pit laterites nickel mining areas.

AB  - Background: Analysis of a large cohort of business travelers will help clinicians focus on frequent and serious illnesses. We aimed to describe travel-related health problems in business travelers.Methods: GeoSentinel Surveillance Network consists of 64 travel and tropical medicine clinics in 29 countries; descriptive analysis was performed on ill business travelers, defined as persons traveling for work, evaluated after international travel 1 January 1997 through 31 December 2014.Results: Among 12 203 business travelers seen 1997-2014 (14 045 eligible diagnoses), the majority (97%) were adults aged 20-64 years; most (74%) reported from Western Europe or North America; two-thirds were male. Most (86%) were outpatients. Fewer than half (45%) reported a pre-travel healthcare encounter. Frequent regions of exposure were sub-Saharan Africa (37%), Southeast Asia (15%) and South Central Asia (14%). The most frequent diagnoses were malaria (9%), acute unspecified diarrhea (8%), viral syndrome (6%), acute bacterial diarrhea (5%) and chronic diarrhea (4%). Species was reported for 973 (90%) of 1079 patients with malaria, predominantly Plasmodium falciparum acquired in sub-Saharan Africa. Of 584 (54%) with malaria chemoprophylaxis information, 92% took none or incomplete courses. Thirteen deaths were reported, over half of which were due to malaria; others succumbed to pneumonia, typhoid fever, rabies, melioidosis and pyogenic abscess.Conclusions: Diarrheal illness was a major cause of morbidity. Malaria contributed substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly among business travelers to sub-Saharan Africa. Underuse or non-use of chemoprophylaxis contributed to malaria cases. Deaths in business travelers could be reduced by improving adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis and targeted vaccination for vaccine-preventable diseases. Pre-travel advice is indicated for business travelers and is currently under-utilized and needs improvement.

AB  - The eastern coastal region of China (ECR) has pioneered the nation in urbanization processes and economic development. The support vector machine (SVM) method was used to extract urban areas in ECR from DMSP-OLS night time lights and SPOT vegetation (VGT) images for the period of 1998-2010. Spatial-temporal urban areas changes were revealed using dynamic degree model, urbanization intensification index and the centriod shift model. The grey relational analysis was adopted to indentify the most influenced social-economic factors of urban expansion and the artificial neural network (ANN-BP) model was used to explore their relationship. Results showed that the average annual growth rate of urban sprawl in ECR was about 13.31 %, and the lowest value of 8.11% was found in 2007. Urban expansion of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan region (Jing-Jin-Ji) and the Pearl River Delta characterized from the center to surrounding areas, whereas the urban land development of the Yangtze River Delta showed a connecting pattern. During 2007-2010, the rate of urban expansion was 11237km(2) per year, and the urban sprawl intensity reached the peak value of 2.565. The urban development center gradually shifted to the northeast in Beijing, while the urban land moved towards southwest in Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta. Urban expansion was closely related to the soci-economic factors including GDP, fiscal revenue, construction output, total fixed asset investment and annual per capita disposable income of urban residents derived from gray correlation model. The simulated urban area by BP neural network model had high correlation with actual values.

AB  - Particulate Matter, representing fine particles with diameters smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM 2.5), are considered to be harmful for both public health and environment. This paper estimated PM 2.5 concentrations in British Columbia (BC), Canada from February to August 2017 in order to compare PM 2.5 levels before and after wildfires by using ground-level PM 2.5 measurements, 3 km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) products and the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model. Additional meteorological data was also utilized to perfect the model. The results showed that the variation of AOD highly represents the distribution of PM 2.5, and PM 2.5 concentrations in July and August were much higher than previous month, which indicated that there was a rapid increase in PM 2.5 levels after the wildfires. In addition, the results also demonstrated that the 3 km MODIS AOD products have high accuracy on providing spatial information when estimating PM 2.5 levels.

AB  - The recent emergence of spaceborne Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) represents a major breakthrough in understanding, monitoring and quantifying global carbon cycle variability and change. However, the existing spaceborne SIF products are typically noisy, coarse and sparse in both time and space coverage, thus are not suitable for regional carbon cycle studies. In this study, we are taking advantage of the complementary characteristics of the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME-2) SIF and MODIS observations of terrestrial ecosystems to downscale the coarse-resolution SIF products into finer spatial and temporal resolutions, using an innovative Ensemble Kalman Filter and parameter estimation with Adaptive Spatial Average scheme (ASA-EnKF) data assimilation technique. We used a simplified version of the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE), level-2 GOME-2 ungridded SIF product to develop a high-quality/ resolution (i.e., 1km, hourly, gap-free) SIF dataset, over the Western United States. This paper demonstrates some preliminary result of our work.

AB  - The effective extraction of continuous features of marine remote sensing image is the key to the processing of marine target recognition. Since many of the existing data mining algorithms can only deal with discrete attributes, it is necessary to convert continuous features into discrete features to adapt to these intelligent algorithms. In addition, most of the current discretization algorithms do not consider the mutual exclusion of attributes as well as that of breakpoints within an attribute when selecting breakpoints, and cannot guarantee the indistinguishable relation of decision table. So, it is not suitable for dealing with remote sensing data with multiple features obviously. Aiming at these problems, a feature preprocessing framework of remote sensing image for marine targets recognition is proposed in this paper. In the frame design of the whole preprocessing algorithm, the equivalent relationship model of information entropy is introduced to perform a series of comparison operations and loop controls, so as to obtain the optimal discretization interval number. Finally, simulation analysis is conducted on the high-resolution remote sensing image data collected in the port areas of South China Sea. The experiment shows that the framework proposed in this paper achieves excellent results in terms of interval number, accuracy, running time, and effectively detects the vessels targets at sea. Therefore, the proposed framework can be very well applied to the discretization of remote sensing image features for marine targets recognition.

AB  - The water-leaving radiance(L-w) and remote sensing reflectance(R-rs) are not only the main apparent optic properties (AOPs) of water but also the basic parameters of ocean water color remote sensing. In order to realize the measurement of water-leaving radiance and remote sensing reflectance in the spectrum with the range from 300 nm to 900 nm, the high precision of the sea-surface radiance, the sky radiance and the sea-surface incident irradiance should be first obtained. The radiometer is composed of the measurement unit, control unit and tracking unit. The measurement unit is the core of the radiometer. Comparing with the previous tunnel radiometer, the measurement unit of the automatic observation radiometer is designed. In order to collect the spectral images of the incident slit into a plane, the radiometer uses flat-field concave grating for diffraction spectroscopy. And the linear array detector can detect the intensity signals of each spectrum simultaneously on the same plane. At the same time, in order to guarantee 10 degrees field of view, the radiometer is equipped with the lens. It is also required to ensure the spectral observation principal plane make 135 degrees with the principal plane so that it can avoid the influence of solar flares. In addition, the instrument shell adopts multi-layer coating treatment to avoid the erosion of the instrument structure parts by sea water and foggy sea atmosphere. After the spectrometer is installed, spectral calibration is done in the laboratory. The full width at half maximum of the radiometer is less than 4nm and the spectrum completely covers from 300nm to 900nm. The development of radiometer fills the gap of the automatic measurement of water-leaving radiance in China. It can inspect and correct satellite data and remote sensing products, and provide continuous and reliable on-site observation data for satellite remote sensing radiation calibration and product authenticity inspection.

TI  - Adaptive Window-Based Constrained Energy Minimization for Detection of Newly Grown Tree Leaves
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf maturation from initiation to senescence is a phenological event of plants that results from the influences of temperature and water availability on physiological activities during a life cycle. Detection of newly grown leaves (NGL) is therefore useful for the diagnosis of tree growth, tree stress, and even climatic change. This paper applies Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM), which is a hyperspectral target detection technique to spot grown leaves in a UAV multispectral image. According to the proportion of NGL in different regions, this paper proposes three innovative CEM based detectors: Subset CEM, Sliding Window-based CEM (SW CEM), and Adaptive Sliding Window-based CEM (AWS CEM). AWS CEM can especially adjust the window size according to the proportion of NGL around the current pixel. The results show that AWS CEM improves the accuracy of NGL detection and also reduces the false alarm rate. In addition, the results of the supervised target detection depend on the appropriate signature. In this case, we propose the Optimal Signature Generation Process (OSGP) to extract the optimal signature. The experimental results illustrate that OSGP can effectively improve the stability and the detection rate.

AB  - Target detection and classification are important applications for polarimetric SAR (PolSAR). Advanced deep learning techniques represented by deep convolutional neural network (CNN) have been utilized to enhance the application performance. One current challenge is how to adapt deep CNN model for PolSAR target detection and classification with limited training samples while keeping good generalization performance. This work attempts to contribute to this problem. The core idea is to incorporate expert knowledge of target scattering mechanism interpretation and polarimetric feature mining to assist deep CNN model training and improve the final application performance. A polarimetric-feature-driven deep CNN detection and classification scheme is established. Both classical polarimetric features and hidden polarimetric features in the rotation domain are used to drive the proposed deep CNN model. Comparison studies validate the efficiency and superiority of the proposal. For ship detection application, two methods respectively driven by classical polarimetric features and the selected polarimetric features show relatively good performances, with detection probabilities over 90.8% for Radarsat-2 data. Considering the overall detection and false-alarm probabilities, the proposed polarimetricfeature-driven CNN approach achieves even better performance. For land cover classification, the proposed method achieves the state of the art classification accuracy for the benchmark AIRSAR data. Meanwhile, the convergence speed from the proposed polarimetric-feature-driven CNN approach is about 2.3 times faster than the normal CNN method. For multi-temporal UAVSAR datasets, the proposed scheme achieves comparably high classification accuracy as the normal CNN method for train-used temporal data, while for train-not-used data it obtains average 4.86% higher overall accuracy than the normal CNN method.

AB  - Damage extents and damage levels of destructed urban areas are essentially important information for rescue planning after a large-scale natural disaster. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide quick response and huge area monitoring to mitigate the further loss. Automatic and accurate mapping of urban damage levels with SAR is still challenging. Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) has the better potential to understand urban damage conditions from the viewpoint of scattering mechanism investigation. Polarimetric coherence is an important source for PolSAR data investigation. The variation of polarimetric coherence in the rotation domain along the radar line of sight contains rich hidden information which relates to target orientation diversity effect. This work focuses on the hidden signature exploration of co-polarization coherence in the rotation domain for urban damage investigation. A damage index is proposed based on the interpretation tool of co-polarization coherence pattern and an urban damage level mapping approach are established. Experimental studies are carried out for the study case of the great 3.11 East Japan earthquake and tsunami using multi-temporal ALOS/ PALSAR PolSAR data. Comparison studies validate the efficiency of the developed mapping approach.

AB  - More than 3800 landslide locations have been reported in the area near the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) along the Yangtze River in China, which poses a serious threat to the socioeconomic stability of the region. An efficient and accurate method of generating landslide susceptibility maps is very important to mitigate the loss of lives and properties caused by these landslides. In this paper, a deep belief network (DBN) with datasets developed via a geographic information system (GIS) and remotely sensed data was used to create a landslide spatial susceptibility map for the TGR region on the Yangtze River in Zigui County. The landslide inventory map was initially constructed using field surveys, aerial photographs, and a literature search of historical landslide records. The twelve causative factors were evaluated in different ways: elevation, topographic slope, topographic aspect, curvature, distance from drainage, distance from road, schedule performance index and topographic wetness index were derived from a digital topographical map at 1:10,000 scale; engineering petrofabric, slope structure and distance from faults were obtained from a geological map at 1: 50,000 scale; normalized difference vegetation index were generated from CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite) data. All the causative factors were resampled to a grid cell size of 10 * 10 m by using the grid analysis function of ArcGIS software. Initially, 30% of the landslides pixels and equal number of non-landslides pixels were randomly selected as training data. Then these twelve factors were used as the input to DBN. By integrating the twelve factor maps in the GIS via pixel-based computing, the landslide spatial susceptibility map was obtained. Then the study area was reclassified into four categories of landslide susceptibility: high, moderate, low, and very low by using natural breaks classification methods. Approximately 13.6% of the study area was identified as severe susceptibility, and moderate, low, very low susceptibility zones covered 1.3%, 1.4%, and 83.7% of the study area, respectively. To show the performance of the DBN, the results were then compared with a logistic regression model (LRM) by using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The area under the ROC curve was 0.949 for the DBN and 0.859 for the LRM. The results showed that, the DBN proposed in this study outperforms the LSM. Based on the efficiency and accuracy of DBN, the proposed approach can be employed for rapid response to natural hazards in the Three Gorges area.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of omitting axillary lymph node dissection in early breast cancer patients with sentinel-node metastases: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: This systemic meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of omitting axillary lymph node dissection in early stage of breast cancer (T1-2) with positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) and without palpable lymphadenopathy. Methods: All available literature of randomized controlled trials (RCT) and cohort studies was pooled from Cochrane library, PubMed, Medline, OVID, Springer Linker, Science Direct, EBSCO. Relevant references were also manually retrieved. The primary outcome was efficacy, including overall survival, disease-free survival, local recurrence. The secondary outcome was safety, including the lymphedema, neuropathy, and dysfunction of arm movement. The meta-analysis was performed by Stata 12.0. Results: Five RCTs and three cohort studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in this meta-analysis. It was found that when compared with no axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) group, ALND did not significantly improve the OS (hazard ratio (HR)=1.01, 95% CI: 0.96 similar to 1.07, P= 0.662), DFS (HR= 0.96, 95% CI: 0.80 similar to 1.15, P=0.644) and local recurrence (OR=2.32, 95% CI: 0.91 similar to 5.89, P=0.78). However, subgroup analysis based on the status of SLN showed that patients with macrometastasis of SLN (defined as tumor deposits> 2 mm) had a higher recurrence rate (OR= 5.96, 95% CI: 1.33 similar to 26.70, P=0.02). The incidence of postoperative complications including lymphedema, sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy and infection in the no-ALND group was significantly lower than that in the ALND group (P<0.05 or 0.01). Conclusion: ALND could be omitted in patients with T1-2 primary breast cancer and without palpable lymphadenopathy.

TI  - Monitoring of post-fire forest regeneration under different restoration treatments based on ALOS/PALSAR data
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-fire forest regeneration is crucial to forest management. Three different restoration treatments including natural regeneration (NR), artificial regeneration (AR), and artificial promotion (AP), were adopted in the Greater Hinggan Mountain area of China after a serious fire occurred on May 6, 1987. NR is a control treatment where recovery occurs naturally without intervention, AR comprises salvage logging followed by planting, while AP includes regeneration by removing dead trees, weeding, and tidying to promote seed germination. In this study, the objective was to detect and compare the effects of the three restoration treatments using radar indices derived from ALOS/PALSAR data. Four time-series SAR images were pre-processed to acquire the backscattering coefficients. Then the coefficients in both HH and HV polarization were examined and two radar vegetation indices were derived and evaluated, based on which, the post-fire forest dynamics under different restoration treatments were detected and compared. The results showed that the forests under NR presented a completely different recovery trajectory compared to those under the other two treatments. This difference could be characterized by both the backscattering intensity in HH and HV polarization and two radar indices. This study indicated the effects of different restoration treatments, as well as demonstrated the applicability and efficiency of radar remote sensing techniques in forest monitoring and management.

TI  - A Review of Fine-Scale Land Use and Land Cover Classification in Open-Pit Mining Areas by Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Over recent decades, fine-scale land use and land cover classification in open-pit mine areas (LCCMA) has become very important for understanding the influence of mining activities on the regional geo-environment, and for environmental impact assessment procedure. This research reviews advances in fine-scale LCCMA from the following aspects. Firstly, it analyzes and proposes classification thematic resolution for LCCMA. Secondly, remote sensing data sources, features, feature selection methods, and classification algorithms for LCCMA are summarized. Thirdly, three major factors that affect LCCMA are discussed: significant three-dimensional terrain features, strong LCCMA feature variability, and homogeneity of spectral-spatial features. Correspondingly, three key scientific issues that limit the accuracy of LCCMA are presented. Finally, several future research directions are discussed: (1) unitization of new sensors, particularly those with stereo survey ability; (2) procurement of sensitive features by new sensors and combinations of sensitive features using novel feature selection methods; (3) development of robust and self-adjusted classification algorithms, such as ensemble learning and deep learning for LCCMA; and (4) application of fine-scale mining information for regularity and management of mines.

TI  - Assessing Different Feature Sets' Effects on Land Cover Classification in Complex Surface-Mined Landscapes by ZiYuan-3 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification (LCC) in complex surface-mined landscapes has become very important for understanding the influence of mining activities on the regional geo-environment. There are three characteristics of complex surface-mined areas limiting LCC: significant three-dimensional terrain, strong temporal-spatial variability of surface cover, and spectral-spatial homogeneity. Thus, determining effective feature sets are very important as input dataset to improve detailed extent of classification schemes and classification accuracy. In this study, data such as various feature sets derived from ZiYuan-3 stereo satellite imagery, a feature subset resulting from a feature selection (FS) procedure, training data polygons, and test sample sets were firstly obtained; then, feature sets' effects on classification accuracy was assessed based on different feature set combination schemes, a FS procedure, and random forest algorithm. The following conclusions were drawn. (1) The importance of feature set could be divided into three grades: the vegetation index (VI), principal component bands (PCs), mean filters (Mean), standard deviation filters (StDev), texture measures (Textures), and topographic variables (TVs) were important; the Gaussian low-pass filters (GLP) was just positive; and none were useless. The descending order of their importance was TVs, StDev, Textures, Mean, PCs, VI, and GLP. (2) TVs and StDev both significantly outperformed VI, PCs, GLP, and Mean; Mean outperformed GLP; all other pairs of feature sets had no difference. In general, the study assessed different feature sets' effects on LCC in complex surface-mined landscapes.

TI  - Classification of PolSAR Images Using Multilayer Autoencoders and a Self-Paced Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a novel polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification method based on multilayer autoencoders and self-paced learning (SPL) is proposed. The multilayer autoencoders network is used to learn the features, which convert raw data into more abstract expressions. Then, softmax regression is applied to produce the predicted probability distributions over all the classes of each pixel. When we optimize the multilayer autoencoders network, self-paced learning is used to accelerate the learning convergence and achieve a stronger generalization capability. Under this learning paradigm, the network learns the easier samples first and gradually involves more difficult samples in the training process. The proposed method achieves the overall classification accuracies of 94.73%, 94.82% and 78.12% on the Flevoland dataset from AIRSAR, Flevoland dataset from RADARSAT-2 and Yellow River delta dataset, respectively. Such results are comparable with other state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - The extension of impervious surface serves as a key indicator of urbanization and environmental quality. This paper explores the integrated use of Landsat imagery and nighttime light (NTL) imagery for impervious surface mapping. An optical and NTL based spectral mixture analysis (ON_SMA) at sub-pixel level is proposed where local endmembers are used and adaptive endmember sets are selected based on the information provided by both sensors. Results illustrate that comparing with optical based spectral mixture analysis, the proposed approach yields effective improvement in impervious surface detection due to the contribution of the NTL data. The findings highlight the potential of combining optical and NTL data for earth observation, which provide opportunities for new applications.

TI  - Chinese satellite photogrammetry without ground control points based on a public DEM using an efficient and robust DEM matching method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Photogrammetry based on high-resolution satellite image can acquire geospatial information within a large area rapidly and timely, but its geopositioning accuracy is highly dependent on ground control points. Under the background of global mapping, a public digital elevation model (DEM) assisted Chinese satellite image geopositioning scheme was proposed to realize satellite photogrammetry without ground control points. To make full use of public DEM advantages of consistent and high accuracy, public DEM was regarded as reference data and matched with the DEM extracted from image, and then the determined transformation parameters were applied to correct direct georeferencing results in object space. A fast least Z-difference method combined with least trimmed squares estimator was proposed to achieve DEM matching, which can not only automatically select corresponding point determination model, but also self-adaptively detect and eliminate difference between DEMs. Multi-groups of comparative experiments using Mapping Satellite-1 and ZiYuan-3 surveying satellite images were designed. Experimental results show that the DEM assisted geopositioning scheme exploits advantages of reference DEM, which can greatly improve the accuracy of photogrammetry without ground control points to a relatively high level. The geopositioning accuracy of image is largely determined by, but not confined to, the accuracy of reference DEM, but it is slightly affected by the resolution of reference DEM. If target DEM resolution is relatively high, the geopositioning accuracy of a single image assisted by Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM can satisfy the accuracy requirements of 1: 50,000 scale mapping perfectly. This scheme also has good robustness and high computational efficiency.

TI  - A Unifying Approach to Classifying Wetlands in the Ontonagon River Basin, Michigan, Using Multi-temporal Landsat-8 OLI Imagery
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial information is critical to the assessment and protection of wetlands in the context of human intervention and global climate change. However, it is challenging to map and monitor wetland vegetation classes with satisfactory results because of their highly seasonal dynamics, spatial heterogeneity, and spectral similarity. This paper examines the effectiveness of various classification approaches commonly employed in wetland mapping, including the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), classification and regression tree (CART) and other remote sensing indices, by using multi-temporal Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) spectral data and end-member fraction data as well as terrain data. These different mapping approaches were compared in the Ontonagon River drainage basin in upper Michigan, USA, where easily-confused wetland types such as forested wetland, palustrine scrub/shrub wetland, and palustrine emergent wetland are extensively distributed. The results show that multi-temporal data sets can reduce the classification omission caused by the highly seasonal dynamic of wetlands. The spatial heterogeneity can partly be characterized by using end-member fraction maps. Classification of the fraction maps had better results than that using the original spectral data, which implies that the selection of data inputs could be more important than the selection of classifiers. While each algorithm has its own capability of discriminating specific wetland types, CART showed relatively better classification results than the others due to its compatibility and lack of assumptions about data normal distribution. Finally, the authors developed a decision tree method (called DTM), which adopted the satisfactory resultant classification of specific wetland types using MLC and SVM classification, to update the wetland map of Ontonagon River Basin with acceptable accuracy (overall accuracy of 89% and kappa coefficients of 0.89).

TI  - Detecting irrigation extent, frequency, and timing in a heterogeneous arid agricultural region using MODIS time series, Landsat imagery, and ancillary data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping irrigated area, frequency, timing, and amount is important for sustainable management of water resources in semi-arid and arid regions. Various studies exist on the mapping of irrigation using remote sensing and census statistics, but they mainly focus on the mapping of irrigation extent without taking frequency and timing into account. In this study, we proposed a new approach to extract irrigation attributes including irrigation extent, frequency and timing using multi-source data moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat, and ancillary data. A time-series dataset with 30-m spatial resolution was generated by fusing 480-m time-series MODIS and Landsat imagery. We used the greenness index (the ratio of NIR and green spectral bands) to detect irrigation events during the first half of the growing season. Rainfall events were assumed as water supplement events along with irrigation events. The number of water supplement stages were then recorded cumulatively when a water supplement event was detected using a threshold-based model. To estimate the possible dates of each water supplement stage, Gaussian process regression and linear regression models were applied. The new framework was applied to the Hexi Corridor in northwestern China, an intensively irrigated region with a semi-arid climate. Results show that the overall accuracy of water supplement stage using the proposed method is 87%. Validation of the number of water supplement stages and possible dates of water supply by GRP model with a "strict" (or "loose") assessment method shows an overall accuracy of 55% (94%) and 59% (89%), respectively. The good accuracy of the additional independent validations for different years and sites demonstrates the robustness of the proposed method, suggesting the general applicability to other regions. Overall, this research demonstrates that the proposed method is promising in detecting irrigation attributes such as frequency and timing which have not been explored in previous research.

AB  - Along with very high-resolution satellites were launched frequently, such as the satellite WorldView-3, panchromatic and multispectral remote-sensing images can be acquired easily. However, it is still an interesting and challenging task to fuse and classify these images. In general, panchromatic image has a high spatial resolution, but with only one spectral band. Multispectral image usually has four or eight bands, but the spatial resolution is four times smaller than panchromatic image. In this paper, an unsupervised feature extraction framework is proposed, which combines multispectral (MS) image and panchromatic (PAN) image into convolution neural network (CNN). There is an image-to-image mapping, learning from the input source (i.e., MS) to the output source (i.e., PAN). Then, by integrating the hidden layer of deep CNN, the extracted features represent MS and PAN data. The experimental results of two practical remote sensing data sets show the validity of the framework.

AB  - In this article, we develop two methods for unsupervised change detection in multitemporal remote sensing images based on Dempster-Shafer's theory of evidence (DST). In most unsupervised change detection methods, the probability of difference image is assumed to be characterized by mixture models, whose parameters are estimated by the expectation maximization (EM) method. However, the main drawback of the EM method is that it does not consider spatial contextual information, which may entail rather noisy detection results with numerous spurious alarms. To remedy this, we firstly develop an evidence theory based EM method (EEM) which incorporates spatial contextual information in EM by iteratively fusing the belief assignments of neighboring pixels to the central pixel. Secondly, an evidential labeling method in the sense of maximizing a posteriori probability (MAP) is proposed in order to further enhance the detection result. It first uses the parameters estimated by EEM to initialize the class labels of a difference image. Then it iteratively fuses class conditional information and spatial contextual information, and updates labels and class parameters. Finally it converges to a fixed state which gives the detection result. A simulated image set and two real remote sensing data sets are used to evaluate the two evidential change detection methods. Experimental results show that the new evidential methods are comparable to other prevalent methods in terms of total error rate.

CP  - International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing (ICALIP)
CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Tropical cyclone (TC) intensity estimation is vital to disastrous weather forecasting. In this paper, the task is approached as a classification problem, regarding the cyclone intensity levels as the class labels. Multispectral Imagery (MSI) captured by a recently launched satellite, No. 4 meteorological satellite (FY-4) of China, is used as the raw data for classification. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a machine learning framework with three major parts: useable band determination, band-wise classification and fusion. The framework is compatible with arbitrary classifiers for the band-wise classification. Since some band images acquired during night hours contain little useful information, a selector is designed and placed before each band classifier. Moreover, majority voting, a very efficient method, is employed to fuse the band-wise classification results. Experiments demonstrate that Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), each in turn used as the band-wise classifiers, can yield high accuracy in labelling the TC intensity. The results also show the usefulness of the FY-4 data and the potentials of machine learning for automatic and accurate TC intensity estimation.

AB  - Background: The accurate measurement of particulate matter (PM) provides a crucial basis for health impact assessment and pollution management and control. However, monitoring stations of air pollution are limited worldwide. Recently, some researchers have attempted to estimate the levels of PM based on remote sensing data, but the methods still need to be validated and further improved.Objectives: This study aimed to develop a new model, to estimate daily ground-level PM2.5 concentrations using the fused aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer and meteorological information.Methods: We combined generalized additive mixed-effects model with the log-linked Gaussian error distribution and non-linear exposure-lag-response model for AOD and meteorological measures, to estimate daily ground level PM2.5 concentrations in 2014-2015 in Guangzhou, China.Results: The PM2.5 concentration was significantly associated with AOD and meteorological measures. Compared to the log-linear model, the non-linear exposure-lag-response model had better model performance with a higher temporal (spatial) cross-validation R-square (0.81 (0.81) vs 0.67 (0.67)), and a smaller mean absolute percentage error (17.65% (16.90%) vs 21.22% (21.01%)). AOD explained about 15% variations of PM2.5 in the mixed-effect model. The planetary-boundary-layer-height-revised AOD and relative-humidity-revised PM2.5 did not significantly improve the model performance.Conclusion: Considering the non-linear exposure-lag-response association between PM2.5 and AOD and meteorological factors can significantly increase the modelling ability to estimate PM2.5 concentrations.

AB  - Up-to-date spatial information on ground movements and land use is useful for emergency management of coastal regions. Time series InSAR techniques have proven to be effective tools for providing the former; however, InSAR results alone cannot be used to characterize the relationship between movements and land use. The focus of this study is to evaluate the potential to use high resolution radar satellite imagery for monitoring urban land subsidence associated with the construction of new building in Canadian coastal cities. To do this, we propose to integrate InSAR and polarimetric SAR information for deformation analysis. The methodology included multidimensional small baseline subset (MSBAS) InSAR analysis, polarimetric SAR change detection, and integration of the coherence, deformation, and polarimetric information for identifying the urban surface movements related to new buildings. The study was conducted in the Vancouver region, BC using RADARSAT-2 satellite data of ultra-fine mode and fine-quad mode acquired during 2010-2016. Results demonstrated that the integration of polarimetric and InSAR data permitted identification of ground movement, and the association of these movements to the new constructions in the urban environment. Several locations have been experiencing subsidence at a rate of up to 10cm/year, and horizontal motion of 5cm/year.

AB  - Soil salinization(1) is one of the major land degradation problems, which result in a serious threat to agricultural production and ecological environment. How to monitor soil salinization is of great significance to the management of saline-alkali soil. Salinealkali soil is estimated quantificationally at regional scale using fully-polarimetric SAR. Based on the monitoring data of salinealkali soil SAR in study area, the four-polarization data in Radarsat-2 image was analyzed, and entropy, anti-entropy, and average scattering angle were extracted to characterize the scattering mechanism. Based on H/a plane space, combined with Wishart unsupervised classification method, the type of observed scattering media is estimated from the physical interpretation of basic scattering mechanism, and the soil salinization information in the study area is extracted. The classification accuracy obtained by using the Wishart classification is compared with the traditional classification algorithm. It is found that the fully polarized SAR image has an irreplaceable advantage in the information extraction of salinealkali land.

TI  - A disaggregation approach for estimating high spatial resolution broadband emissivity for bare soils from Landsat surface reflectance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution land surface broadband emissivity (BBE) is not only useful for surface energy balance studies at local scales, but also can bridge the gap between existing coarser resolution BBE products and point-based field measurements. This study proposes a disaggregation approach that utilizes the established BBE-reflectance relationship for estimating high spatial resolution BBE for bare soils from Landsat surface reflectance data. The disaggregated BBE is compared to the BBE calculated from spatial-temporal matched Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance Radiometer emissivity product. Comparison results show that better agreement is achieved over relative homogeneous areas, but deteriorated over heterogeneous and cloud-contaminated areas. In addition, field-measured emissivity data over large homogeneous desert were also used to validate the disaggregated BBE, and the bias is 0.005. The comparison and validation results indicated that the disaggregation approach can obtain high spatial resolution BBE with better accuracy for homogeneous area.

TI  - Mapping oil palm extent in Malaysia using ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The extent of oil palm plantations has increased rapidly in Malaysia over the past few decades. To evaluate ecological effects and economic values, it is important to produce an accurate oil palm map for Malaysia. The Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) on the Advance Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) is useful in land-cover mapping in tropical regions under all-weather conditions. In this study, PALSAR-2 images from 2015 were used for oil palm mapping with maximum likelihood classifier (MLC)-based supervised classification. The processed PALSAR-2 data were resampled to multiple coarser resolutions (50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000m), and then used to investigate the effect of speckle in oil palm mapping. Both independent testing samples and inventories from the Malaysia Palm Oil Board (MPOB) were used to evaluate the mapping accuracy. The oil palm mapping result indicates 50-500m to be a good resolution for either retaining spatial details or reducing speckle noise of PALSAR-2 images. Among which, the best overall mapping accuracies and average oil palm accuracies reached 94.50% and 89.78%, respectively. Moreover, the oil palm area derived from the 100-m resolution map is 6.14 million hectares (Mha), which is the closest to the official MPOB inventories (8.87% overestimation).

AB  - In recent decades, palm oil, which forms one of the world's major bulk feedstock and oil crops, has been cultivated at an increasing scale to meet new demand. Oil palm expansion has driven not only socio-economic development but also serious ecological problems and environmental pollution through deforestation and fires to clear the forests. Uneconomic oil palm plantations can influence the balance of regional ecosystems and the carbon cycle. Many countries report national statistics on the area of oil palm, but few document the extent and locations of oil palm plantations. In this study, we produce and make available oil palm maps that include 15 countries with more than 10,000ha of planted oil palms. Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture (PALSAR-2) images and high-resolution (<2.5m) images in Google Earth were used to produce oil palm maps by supervised classification and visual interpretation. Two independent verification systems were used to evaluate map accuracy. The characteristics of oil palm plantations distribution and their environment suitability including terrain and climate conditions of the global oil palm planted regions are also discussed. The results indicate that the total area of oil palm in global in 2016 was estimated to be 29.49 million hectares (Mha) although the mapping result showed a good correlation with other records, but relatively large uncertainty in Africa. Most oil palm trees grow in warm (24-29.5 degrees C), wet conditions (1000-4000mm p.a. of precipitation), flat terrain (slope less than 8 degrees), and low elevation (0-800m); however, these growing conditions are slightly different in different continents.

AB  - In recent years, with the development of mobile location services and cloud computing technology, the collection and processing of mobile location information has become a reality. The mass database which is composed of mobile location data has promoted the development of the research on mobile location data. It is very important for us to understand the spatial distribution and temporal characteristics of moving patterns and identify the mechanism of motion formation, predict the future development of sports through trajectory clustering analysis. At present, trajectory clustering research mainly focuses on the spatial position changes of moving objects. Temporal constraints in spatial and temporal clustering are generally auxiliary information, but do not really participate in clustering. In this paper, a clustering algorithm for trajectory data based on spatiotemporal pattern is proposed. First, the curve edge detection method is used to extract the trajectory feature points. Then the trajectory is divided into sub track segments according to the trajectory feature points. Finally, the density based clustering algorithm is applied to cluster according to the temporal and spatial similarity between sub trajectories. The Hot spot analysis experimental based on Chengdu taxi GPS track data results show that the similarity measurement based on spatiotemporal features can get better clustering results because of both the spatial and temporal characteristics of the trajectory.

M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas in Nigeria are important ecosystems for carbon storage. The aim of this study was to estimate and map tree aboveground biomass (TAGB) and carbon (TAGC) within a tropical forest in Nigeria. Stepwise regression analysis was implemented to develop models for predicting TAGB in the forest stand, by integrating field TAGB data with Landsat 8 OLI data. Spectral variables used in the analysis include spectral bands, vegetation indices, tasseled cap indices and principal components. Model validation was performed using independent sample plots. The results showed that incorporating more than one category of spectral variables improved the prediction of TAGB. The best-fit model was applied to map the spatial distribution of TAGB and TAGC. The TAGC was estimated as 52.3% of TAGB, based on the average carbon content of tree species derived in this study. Average TAGB and TAGC estimates for the forest stand were 373.1 +/- 165.4 t ha(-1) and 194 +/- 82.7 t ha(-1), respectively. Reliable estimates of TAGB and TAGC for the forest reserve were obtained. This study provides important information required to manage the forest stand for optimal carbon sequestration.

AB  - R&E (Research and Education) program has been emphasized since it can improve student’s scientific thinking, problem solving ability, and creativity, with providing diverse opportunities for scientific research experiences that are difficult to access in this curriculum. In this study, we reconstructed a method of calculating high resolution sea surface temperature data in the coastal region around Korea using satellite data, and developed it into a R&E program for science-gifted students. In order to calculate the high resolution sea surface temperature data in the seas around Gyeonggi Bay and to understand the spatio-temporal distribution, 9 Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (Operational Land Imager and Thermal InfraRed Sensor) satellite data were collected from December 21, 2013 to November 30, 2017. To understand the accurate sea surface temperature distribution, land area was masked by using SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data, tidal flat was detected by applying the land use classification algorithm, and cloud was removed by applying a threshold to visible wavelength band of Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite. High resolution sea surface temperature data in the seas around Gyeonggi Bay was calculated by applying MCSST (Multi-Channel Sea Surface Temperature) to preprocessed Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite data. In order to develop the R&E program that can be used practically, we simplified the research process and developed learning worksheets suitable for each research stage so that students can perform the research process step by step. We conducted R&E program for students of science and gifted students from June 24, 2017 to January 13, 2018 and confirmed the applicability of R&E program based on satellite data.

AB  - The paper presents the vegetation thematic classification of the Burla banded pine forest carried on using "Canopus-V" remote sensing data and the supervised classification technique by a spectral angle mapper. Areas of selected elements have been assessed: 1. Pine forests, 2. Birch forests; 3. Meadows; 4. Anthropogenic objects (roads, etc.); 5. Agricultural lands; 6. Water objects. Sites of anthropogenic disturbed forests are identified according to remote sensing data. The results show that the data obtained in the classification by a spectral angle can be used to compile geobotanical maps, but due to low spectral resolution of Canopus-V satellite data, it is not always possible to classify individual objects validlys.

TI  - NEW WORLD OUTLOOK IN THE LIGHT OF THE WESTERNIZATION OF PETER I
T2  - MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The reign of Peter I paradoxically combined both the apogee of the might of the old patrimonial state and the accelerated westernization of the country. The article briefly analyzes some of the factors that strengthened the state patrimonial system: the consequences of the decree on the Unified Heritage of 1714 and the expansion of serfdom due to the appearance of new categories of serfs.To a greater extent, the article is devoted to the study of accelerated Westernization in Russia under Peter the Great. It resulted in the curtailment of the patrimonial way of life in Russia.The article focuses on the emergence of a new worldview doctrine. It considers various forms through which the formation of new understandings of social structures, culture, system of power and life in general took place. Such new practices as uttering panegyrics in honor of the monarch and his policies, public celebration of military victories (the organization of the so-called << Triumphs >>) and the church reforms greatly contributed to the formation of the new worldview. One of the vivid figures exemplifying it was Theophan Prokopovich.In the first quarter of the 18th century westernization came to Russia directly from Western Europe. It removed all barriers to direct communication between Russians and foreigners, discredited the old ecclesiastical postulate that all Western Christians were "heretics", paved the way for the beginning of internal modernization as well as for the tragic fate of the socio-cultural split in Russia between the upper educated social strata and the bulk of the Russian population that remained in the Middle Ages.

AB  - The main trends and prospects of development of nuclear medicine, problems and possible ways of their solution are considered in the article. The main scientific directions in the development of radiopharmaceuticals for the diagnosis and radionuclide therapy of malignant tumors (radiopharmaceuticals that can accumulate in tissues surrounding the tumor; radiopharmaceuticals that can accumulate on the membranes of tumor cells, radiopharmaceuticals that can accumulate in tumor cells, radiopharmaceuticals for sentinel lymph nodes detection). It is shown that the current trends in the development of nuclear medicine are closely related to theranostics (therapy + diagnostics) using radiopharmaceuticals obtained on the basis of a target compound labeled with different isotopes intended for diagnosis or therapy. In nuclear medicine, such tandems are used to individualize and plan of radionuclide therapy. The results of our own research on the development of radiopharmaceuticals for tumor imaging and detection of sentinel lymph nodes are presented. The functional utility of radiopharmaceuticals and the prospects of their clinical use are shown.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spotted fever group rickettsioses (SFGRs), such as African tick bite fever (ATBF), are among the most commonly diagnosed diseases for ill travelers returning from southern Africa. We summarized demographic, clinical, and diagnostic features of imported SFGR cases in U.S. travelers returning from Africa who had laboratory specimens submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Diagnosis of SFGR was performed by indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay, immunohistochemical staining, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or culture. Cases were defined as probable SFGR, confirmed SFGR, or confirmed ATBF. Clinical and epidemiological categorical variables were described as counts and proportions; continuous variables were described using geometric-mean titers, median, and range. One hundred and twenty-seven patients satisfied laboratory criteria for confirmed or probable SFGR. Fever was the most common symptom (N = 88; 69%), followed by >= 1 eschars (N = 70; 55%). Paired serums were submitted for 36 patients (28%); 12 patients (33%) had nonreactive initial serum sample but converted to a titer >= 64 with the convalescent sample. Twenty-seven patients (21%) had infection with Rickettsia africae based on PCR analysis of eschar swab (N = 8) or biopsy (N = 23). Fifteen patients had eschar biopsy or swab samples and serum sample(s) submitted together; 9 (60%) had PCR-positive eschar results and nonreactive acute serology. Health-care providers should consider SFGR when evaluating patients for a febrile illness with eschar and compatible foreign travel history. Polymerase chain reaction testing of eschar biopsies or swabs provides a confirmed diagnosis in early stages of disease; eschar swabs or biopsies are an underutilized diagnostic technique.

TI  - IMPACT OF CORE-SELF EVALUATION AND JOB SATISFACTION ON TURNOVER INTENTIONS: A STUDY OF INDIAN RETAIL SECTOR
T2  - ORGANIZATIONS AND MARKETS IN EMERGING ECONOMIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Attrition is the major problem in the Indian Retail Industry which experienced the attrition rate of 19.4% in FY 2016 according to KPMG Annual Compensation Trends Survey 2017-18. The focus of these organizations is to reduce turnover by focusing on the underlying factors leading to turnover intentions and actual turnover. The present study was conducted to explore the effect of job satisfaction and core self-evaluation on turnover intentions. The purpose of the study was also to see if core self-evaluation (CSE) moderates the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intentions. The study was conducted using structured questionnaires for measuring the above-mentioned variables. The sample of the study was 347 salespersons from various retail organizations working in Delhi and NCR. Hierarchical multiple regression showed that both job satisfaction and CSE were negatively related to turnover intentions. Also, CSE was found to moderate the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intentions such that the relationship was stronger for the employees with low core self-evaluation. The present study has important implications for policy makers in the retail sector. Managers should use strategies to increase job satisfaction in order to curb high attrition in this sector. They must be aware of the moderating role played by personality attributes in the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intentions.

AB  - Based on the analysis of the identity management mechanism of OpenStack cloud platform security component Keystone, this paper proposes an OpenStack identity management enhancement scheme to solve the problem that its identity authentication mechanism is too simple and not open enough. The program uses the open security management interface provided by open source security component FreeIPA to add a security component Sentinel in OpenStack. Sentinel implements external user authentication, internal host-service management, and access control in OpenStack by calling the FreeIPA security interface. The effectiveness of Sentinel's authentication to external users is demonstrated by testing the OpenStack platform for external users.

TI  - Assessment of Nigeriasat-1 satellite data for urban land use/land cover analysis using object-based image analysis in Abuja, Nigeria
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the usefulness of Nigeriasat-1 satellite data for urban land cover analysis by comparing it with Landsat and SPOT data. The data-sets for Abuja were classified with pixel- and object-based methods. While the pixel-based method was classified with the spectral properties of the images, the object-based approach included an extra layer of land use cadastre data. The classification accuracy results for OBIA show that Landsat 7 ETM, Nigeriasat-1 SLIM and SPOT 5 HRG had overall accuracies of 92, 89 and 96%, respectively, while the classification accuracy for pixel-based classification were 88% for Landsat 7 ETM, 63% for Nigeriasat-1 SLIM and 89% for SPOT 5 HRG. The results indicate that given the right classification tools, the analysis of Nigeriasat-1 data can be compared with Landsat and SPOT data which are widely used for urban land use and land cover analysis.

AB  - This study aims to map built-up areas using SAR data provided by the Sentinel-1 mission. The proposed algorithm exploits several features offered by the satellite mission such as: high revisit time, dual-polarization data and Interferometric SAR coherence. The algorithm is based on an adaptive parametric thresholding methodology that identifies pixels with high backscattering values in both VV and VH channels corresponding to built-up areas. The Interferometric SAR coherence allows discriminating false alarms caused by other land cover classes characterized by high backscattering values which are not coherent in time (e.g. certain types of vegetated areas). Both the intensity in VV and VH, as well as coherence features are obtained by averaging multi-temporal SAR series. This allows reducing the speckle without any loss in spatial resolution. The algorithm has been tested on Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide Swath data from five different test sites located in semiarid and arid regions in the Mediterranean region and Northern Africa.

AB  - As of today, SAR imagery represents the most commonly used data source for remote sensing-based flood mapping. The data are characterized by a good sensitivity to water and are available day and night, regardless of cloud cover. Many studies have demonstrated that SAR systems are suitable tools for flood mapping on bare soils and scarcely vegetated areas. In spite of the progress in the development of Near Real Time SAR based flood mapping algorithms, the detection of inundation in urban areas still represents a critical issue.Here we propose a methodology for identifying floods that heavily affected the city of Houston (Texas) during the 2017 hurricane season. Our approach takes advantage of the Interferometric SAR coherence feature to detect the presence of floodwater in urbanized areas. In particular, data provided by the Sentinel-1 mission in both, Strip Map and Interferometric Wide Swath modes, have been used, with a geometric resolution of 5m and 20m, respectively. The algorithm takes fully advantage of the Sentinel-1 mission's repeat cycle of six days, thereby providing an unprecedented possibility to develop an automatic, high frequency flood mapping application that is suitable for complex environments. The test of the algorithm for the Houston case study showed promising results for mapping flood in urban areas.

TI  - Temporal variations in snow albedo at glaciated upper elevation zone of an Eastern Himalayan river basin
T2  - HIMALAYAN CRYOSPHERE: PAST AND PRESENT
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences
CL  - INDIA
AB  - Snow albedo is an important climate parameter as it governs the amount of solar energy absorbed by the snow and can be considered a major contributor to the surface radiation budget. The present study deals with the estimation of temporal variation of snow albedo at the upper elevation zone of glaciated Mago Basin of Arunachal Pradesh in eastern Himalaya. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Daily Snow Products (MOD10A1 and MYD10A1) at 500 m spatial resolution were used. Both the MODIS data for ten years (2003-13) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) digital elevation model (DEM) of the study area were downloaded from NASA DAAC of NSIDC. The percentage area under different snow types (dry snow, wet snow, firn and ice) was determined by masking the upper elevation zone of the DEM into the albedo images. The average monthly slopes show a decreasing trend in area (%) of dry snow and wet snow and an increasing trend for firn and ice. Dry snow and wet snow cover percentages were observed to be decreasing, whereas firn and ice cover showed an increasing trend for most of the months. Firn dominated the type of snow, followed by ice then wet snow; the smallest area (%) was that of dry snow for the study period.

TI  - Comparative Lexical-semantic Analysis and Translation of Colour Terms
T2  - CLASIC SI MODERN IN CERCETAREA FILOLOGICA ROMANEASCA ACTUALA
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 16th International Symposium of Institute-of-Romanian-Philology on Classical and Modern in the present Romanian Philological Research
CL  - Iasi, ROMANIA
AB  - The present article is aimed at highlighting the importance of the lexical-semantic comparative analysis in translation studies in general and its application to the translation of colour terms in particular. It is a well-known fact that colour words are a vast field of research which allows numerous approaches to their study. As far as the translation of colour terms is concerned, this subject has proved to be extremely fruitful, being also applicable to the real practice of rendering a text in another language. According to one of the most widely spread and accepted opinions in the field of translation studies, establishing interlingual correspondences between two lexemes denoting colour not infrequently requires not only consulting bilingual dictionaries (which often prove to even confuse and disorient the translator), but also an attentive and meticulous analysis of the respective units in the two languages. We strongly believe that such analysis presupposes, first and foremost, consulting explicative monolingual dictionaries - the sources which not only comprehensively present the semantics of a word and its collocations, but also allow observing the lexeme under discussion with the eyes of a native, from his point of view, otherwise stated, as a part of his worldview. Therefore, our study will try to present convincing evidence of the necessity of the application of comparative lexical-semantic analysis in the process of translation. With a view to fulfilling this task, we are going to confront the passages from artistic texts (both original and translated ones) which contain colour terms in the English, Russian, Italian and Romanian languages, bringing to the fore the divergencies that appear as a result of not only linguistic, but also cultural transfer and highlighting the way the comparative lexical-semantic analysis could eliminate - at least partially - these discrepancies.

TI  - Disaggregation of Landsat-8 Thermal Data Using Guided SWIR Imagery on the Scene of a Wildfire
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal data products derived from remotely sensed data play significant roles as key parameters for biophysical phenomena. However, a trade-off between spatial and spectral resolutions has existed in thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing systems, with the end product being the limited resolution of the TIR sensor. In order to treat this problem, various disaggregation methods of TIR data, based on the indices from visible and near-infrared (VNIR), have been developed to sharpen the coarser spatial resolution of TIR data. Although these methods were reported to exhibit sufficient performance in each study, preservation of thermal variation in the original TIR data is still difficult, especially in fire areas due to the distortion of the VNIR reflectance by the impact of smoke. To solve this issue, this study proposes an efficient and improved disaggregation algorithm of TIR imagery on wildfire areas using guided shortwave infrared (SWIR) band imagery via a guided image filter (GF). Radiometric characteristics of SWIR wavelengths could preserve spatially high frequency temperature components in flaming combustion, and the GF preserved thermal variation of the original TIR data in the disaggregated result. The proposed algorithm was evaluated using Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) and thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) images on wildfire areas, and compared with other algorithms based on a vegetation index (VI) originating from VNIR. In quantitative analysis, the proposed disaggregation method yielded the best values of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (CC), erreur relative globale adimensionelle de synthese (ERGAS), and universal image quality index (UIQI). Furthermore, unlike in other methods, the disaggregated temperature map in the proposed method reflected the thermal variation of wildfire in visual analysis. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm was successfully applied to the TIR data, especially to wildfire areas in terms of quantitative and visual assessments.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 28-km diameter Tunnunik impact structure in northern Victoria Island, Arctic Canada, was mapped using ASTER, Landsat 8, RADARSAT-2 polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and Quickbird data. Multispectral analysis was accomplished through band ratios, MNF transform, and spectral matching algorithms, from which 4 distinct spectral units were defined. Polarimetric SAR decompositions also showed different scattering mechanisms for these 4 units indicating different surface roughness properties. These multispectral and polarimetric SAR observations were combined with detailed surface textures and morphological features as visible in very high-resolution Quickbird imagery (61cm/pixel). Remote sensing parameters and their thresholds for characterizing each unit were implemented into a decision-tree algorithm and a remote predictive geological map was produced. Subsequent field and follow-up laboratory investigations enabled the ground-truthing of these predictions. The geological units were defined as follows: (i) (smooth) fluvioglacial deposits, (ii) (moderately rough) chert-bearing dolostone, (iii) (rough) dolostone, and (iv) (rough) dolostone covered by silicified surfaces. The rough surfaces characterized by multiple scattering in the polarimetric SAR decomposition correspond to the occurrences of weathered carbonate rocks, which are relatively resistant to weathering and form blocky surfaces. This shows that SAR-derived surface roughness properties can greatly contribute to defining geological units by combining with lithological mapping.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Subdural hematoma (SDH) due to spontaneous rupture of intracranial aneurysm rarely occurs. The prevalence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with SDH is approximately 0.5%-10.3% of all aneurysmal SAH. We report a case of aneurysmal rupture with SDH and SAH due to arachnoid defect after aneurysm clipping. The decedent was a 51-year-old woman who underwent brain surgery for SAH a few years ago. Two days before she died, she had nausea and sentinel headache. She was alive in the morning and was found dead at 6 PM. Injuries in the external surface were not found. A fresh SDH, measured approximately 90 mL, was found in the right hemisphere. SAH was diffusely distributed at the base of the brain and the right sylvian fissure. Two aneurysmal clippings were found in the anterior communicating artery and right internal carotid artery.A ruptured de novo aneurysm was also found in the right proximal middle cerebral artery. An uncal herniation was also observed. The cause of death was SAH with SDH due to de novo intracranial aneurysm. The tearing caused by the adhesion between the aneurysm and arachnoid, high blood pressure, and massive bleeding has been thought to be the causative mechanism of aneurysmal SAH with SDH. However, in this case, the arachnoid defect was caused by aneurysmal clipping through pterional approach. This defect served as the passage between the subarachnoid and subdural spaces. The autopsy for recurrent intracranial aneurysm will increase according to the extending life expectancy of patients after aneurysmal clipping.

AB  - Seagrass beds provide habitat for invertebrate and fish species, many of which are economically important. In addition, they perform important physical functions such as trapping sediment particulates associated with dissipating wave energy, thus are helpful to maintain clear waters. We, here, generated the map of seagrass distribution using remotely sensed images to which atmospheric corrections and water column corrections had been applied. Then, the seagrass habitat distribution changes were calculated by seagrass habitat map. For this study, we selected Deukryang Bay located on the southern coast of the Korean peninsula. It is surrounded by small villages like Jinmok-ri and Ongam-ri. Zostera marina dominated at the bay, small amounts of Z. caulescens and Halophila nipponica are also distributed in this area. The results showed that image classifications to which the water column correction had been applied produced improved accuracies in all the classification algorithms we had employed. The object-based classification algorithm showed the highest accuracy, but it is effective method for the high spatial resolution remotely sensed images, consequently not suitable for monitoring changes of the long-term base. Thus, we applied the Mahalanobis distance method which had been known to suitable for medium spatial resolution images like Landsat. This study revealed that seagrass beds in the study area showed similar pattern of distribution during recent 20 years.

AB  - We study turbulent oceanic flows in the context of ocean color. Observations of the submesoscale processes with scales of O(1km) and O(1day) has been difficult from a satellite because spatial and temporal sampling frequencies of satellite data do not typically meet the range of submesoscale oceanic processes. The advent of geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) that has high spatio-temporal resolutions (hourly observation with 500-m ground sampling distance) enables us to observe scalar and velocity fields in the submesoscale range near the Korean Peninsula. This motivates us to use the GOCI to study how submesoscale processes interact with pseudo-passive tracers such as phytoplankton, suspended sediment, and floating algae (e.g. Sargassum). The surface current in the East/ Japan sea is derived from the spatial and temporal changes in chlorophyll-a concentration using the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) method. The procedures that generate surface velocity field and some applications that utilize the velocity field for the study of submesoscale turbulence over the oceanic surface are introduced.

AB  - As an object, design takes on an existential significance that compose our environment. In addition, the developments and changes in science, technology, and design are recognized as forms of worldview that have important practical significance. As such, if design or objects are converted to “presence-at-hand” (vorhandenheit) as mentioned by Martin Heidegger(1889-1976), then its use has expired, terminating its relationship with the user. That is, the qualification, necessity, and utility as “presence-at-hand” are lost, becoming redundant beings and ultimately disposed. Such result comes about in the process of understanding design in terms of market economy and as a source of wealth. This is why introspection is required to develop designed for people and the society.In general, introspection refers to the act of evaluating and interpreting new realities and experiences with a basis on the existing cognitive structure, with the ultimate goal of deducing a new understanding. As such, Chapter 2 reviews related academic literature to understand the negative aspects of inherent in design in the contemporary era. Going further, Chapter 3 studies a possibility of converting the negative aspects discussed in the previous chapter into positive factors. As a result, the current study looks at the potential of introspective design as a way of overcoming the negative aspects of design, in the hopes that this process will serve as an opportunity to acknowledge that design is a meaningful physical object.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the compensation effect on the other joints by inducing stiff-knee and equinus attachment by using one side lower limb brace to normal people during gait. Ten subjects were participated in the experiment(age: 26.0±6.3 yrs, height: 175.5±5.3 cm, weight: 69.1±6.1 kg). There were three condition of gait attaching position using brace(free gait, stiffe-knee gait, equinus gait). The study method adopted 3D analysis with six cameras and ground reaction force with one force-plates. The results were as follows; In angular displacement of right hip joint, equinus gait showed more flexion than other gait in RHC, LTO, RMS, RTO, LMS, and RHC1. In angular displacement of left hip joint, equinus gait showed more flexion than free gait in RHC and RHC1, and equinus gait showed more flexion than other gait in LTO, RMS, LHC, RTO and LMS.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the causes of Korean churches which are being criticized by losing good influence and propose measures to overcome this situation. The essence of the crisis in Korean churches is that the Bible is not a standard for leading the Christian life and one of the causes is the inefficient Bible study. The Bible study in the church was conducted in a way that did not teach the principles of the Bible. As a result, it does not help the Congregation to think deeply based on the principle of gospel(the double Commendments of Love) and form a Christian worldview.The study emphasizes that Learner-Centered Learning should be introduced into the Bible study as a way to form a mature Christian worldview. The Learner-Centered Learning method can be divided into Problem-Based Learning method and Debate/Discussion Learning method. Problem-Based Learning is a Learning method that allows the Learner to learn the principle that triggers each  action rather than the specific actions in the divers context. Debate/Discussion Learning is a learning method that extends learners’ understanding through the active participation and one of the best examples of this method is Havruta which is the Jewish learning practice.The study argues that Bible teaching material production and biblical studies are effective in forming a Christian worldview in order to utilize the Havruta method for Learner-Centered Bible study. The Bible study applied in the church suggests the possibility that Congregation pursue a healthy Christian worldview and transform their real lives.

TI  - An assessment of satellite-based agricultural water productivity over the Indian region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The preliminary analysis of agricultural water productivity (AWP) over India using satellite data were investigated through productivity mapping, water use (actual evapotranspiration (ETa)/effective rainfall (R-eff) mapping and water productivity mapping. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data was used for generating agricultural land cover (MCD12Q1 at 500m), gross primary productivity (GPP; MOD17A2 at 1km), and ETa (MOD16A2 at 1km). R-eff was estimated at 10km using the United States Department of Agriculture soil conservation service method from daily National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center rainfall data. Six years' (2007-2012) data were analysed from June to October. The seasonal AWP and rainwater productivity (RWP) were estimated using the ratios of seasonal GPP (kg C m(-2)) and water use (mm) maps. The average AWP and RWP ranges from 1.10-1.30kg Cm-3 and 0.94-1.0kg C m(-3), respectively, with no significant annual variability but a wide spatial variability over India. The highest AWP was observed in northern India (1.22-1.80kg C m(-3)) and lowest in western India (0.81-1.0kg C m(-3)). Large variations in AWP (0.69-1.80 kg C m(-3)) were observed in Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, northeastern states (except Assam), Kerala, and Uttaranchal. The low GPP of these areas (0.0013-0.13kg C m(-2)) with low seasonal total ETa (<101mm) and R-eff (<72mm) making the AWP high that do not correspond to high productivity but possible water stress. Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Karnataka showed low AWP (0.73-1.13kg C m(-3)) despite having high ETa (261-558mm) and high R-eff (287-469mm), indicating significant scope for improving productivity. The highest RWP was observed in northern parts and Indo-Gangetic plains (0.80-1.6kg C m(-3)). The 6 years' analysis reveals the status of AWP, leading to appropriate interventions to better manage land and water resources, which have great importance in global food security analysis.

TI  - The ontological law of Tawhid contra "<i>Shari'ah</i>-compliance' in Islamic portfolio finance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study/paper is the generalized ontological law of monotheism (unity of knowledge) and its functioning in the financial world system is summarized and contrasted with the recent conception of shari'ah-compliance. Thereby, some specific rulings of shari'ah-compliance in Islamic finance are critically annulled. The principal problem of the inability of shari'ah-compliance in the formalism of rate-setting and debt cancellation is pointed out in analytical ways. The alternative valuation models in the light of the Tawhidi ontological law are formalized. Many important issues are examined in analytical and Tawhidi authentic ways of Islamic law contra to shari'ah-compliance.Design/methodology/approach The epistemological approach commencing from the Tawhidi ontological law is used as the premise of developing analytical formalism to counter the irrelevant rulings done by the field of shari'ah compliance. Thereby, endogenous moral and ethical foundations are studied in deriving analytical finance models of asset valuation, rate-determination and debt cancellation.Findings Substantive analytical results are derived for intellection in the area of the primal ontological law of Tawhid that negates many of the rulings framed up in shari'ah-compliance area of Islamic law. These results can guide financial academia, practitioners and policymakers.Research limitations/implications The paper can be expanded subsequently to the area of analytical Islamic finance in general by further investigating the Modigliani and Miller theorem on optimal debt-equity structure of corporate finance. An introduction to this study is provided in this paper as a starting point of dealing with the debt problem of shari'ah-compliance.Practical implications The paper presents important guidance as input for the rulings of shari'ah-compliance idea held by shari'ah advisory boards and similar institutions presently operating at the financial level.Social implications The paper presents a subtle transformation of the social and financial order in the light of the Tawhidi ontological law quite differently from the way that shari'ah-compliance envisions.Originality/value The theoretical and projected applied perspectives in analytical finance presented in this paper provide a methodological worldview for all areas of social finance with ethical consciousness. Such analytical approach is much needed today in the reconstruction of global finance in the scale of ethics and away from the sole focus on capital market efficiency.

TI  - <i>Tawhidi</i> Islamic economics in reference to the methodology arising from the Qur'an and the Sunnah
T2  - ISRA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC FINANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to lay down the methodological structure of the epistemology of tawhid (Oneness of Allah). In this paper, the meaning of tawhid also refers to the monotheistic unity of knowledge (consilience) in the cast of its organic pairing by circular causation relations between the moral and material possibilities. The paper thereby raises the critique of mainstream economic reasoning and its imitation by existing Islamic economics. Consequently, by the ontological, epistemological and phenomenological foundation of tawhidi methodological worldview, an altogether new socio-scientific reasoning in generality and economic reasoning in particular is introduced.Design/methodology/approach - The socio-scientific methodological reasoning of unity of knowledge according to the tawhidi methodological worldview is introduced contrary to the inept rational choice postulates of mainstream economic reasoning and its imitation by existing notions of Islamic economics. The method of instructing students in the light of this approach according to Tawhidi Islamic Economics (TIE) is introduced from the existing literature.Findings - The existing nature of mainstream economics and its imitation by Islamic economics is critically deconstructed and replaced by the true epistemological, ontological and phenomenological perspectives of TIE in the world of learning. Some inner properties of such a methodological study of TIE are laid bare for further investigation.Originality/value - This is the first paper of its kind in this journal to expound the original and most creative methodological worldview that Islamic economics must bear. This is the foundation of the development of the true stance of Islamic economics and finance.

AB  - Management of software information is difficult for various reasons. First, software typically cannot be reduced to a single object: information about software is an aggregate of software code, APIs, documentation, installations guides, tutorials, user interfaces, test data, dependencies on hardware and other software, etc. Moreover, secondary information about software, especially use cases and experience with employing the software, is important to communicate. Second, typically named software, which we term here a 'software product', is taken to stand for all versions of the software which can have different features and properties and may produced different results from the same input data. Software production is a dynamic process and software development is, increasingly, widely distributed. Therefore GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and other platforms for sharing are used. Information about software is alos provided in different locations, on websites, repositories, portals, etc. Each resource provides information about software from a particular point of view, but the information is often not linked together. Therefore swMATH has developed a conception which covers portals and a search engines for mathematical software, persistent and citable landing pages for specific software, and a method for software archiving. Based on the publication-based approach, swMATH collects and analyses semi-automatically the existing information about mathematical software found on the Web and makes it available in a user-oriented way. In the talk, we discuss recent extensions of the swMATH conception. We focus on the connection between the swMATH landing pages and different repositories for software.

AB  - The regular acquisition of Earth Observations by remote sensing satellites provides long-term Satellite Image Time Series (SITS). Land surface spectral variability provides the capacity for the assessment of Land Use/Cover Change (LUCC) information through SITS. As the reduction of deforestation rates is a matter of global concern, we selected a test area in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest to assess LUCC information through long-term SITS. Top of Atmosphere reflectance images acquired from Landsat satellites between 1984 and 2017 were downloaded. A filtering process was carried out through the analysis of cloud and shadow masks. A total of 279 images were used to build a long-term Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) SITS for every pixel. Images from across 7 years were used to identify SITS for the classes No Change, Anthropic Change, and Natural Change in order to define reference SITS. The Fast-Dynamic Time Warping (FastDTW) algorithm was used to compute the similarity between the reference SITS and the SITS to be labeled. The K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm was applied to classify the SITS based on the similarity measurements. Two different values of the FastDTW radius parameter were used to build two LUCC maps. The overall accuracies of the LUCC maps were 58.06% and 55.02%, for the radius parameter of one and 20, respectively. It was observed that atmospheric effects, clouds, cloud shadows, smoke, among other noisy agents, can modify the real SITS shape. As a result, the use of raw SITS can lead to a reduction in the accuracy of LUCC maps. Furthermore, high cloud coverage in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest results in high-frequency irregularity in the SITS, which further reduces the accuracy of the LUCC maps. However, the study showed that the long-term NDVI SITS can describe land cover types and the classes defined despite the constraints mentioned.

In this work, the general approaches to monitoring surface soil moisture for Tibet area were developed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and ground observations. The result shows that MODIS Vegetation Supply Water Index (VSWI) and band-7 reflectance are significantly correlated with ground measured soil moisture and MODIS band 7 is a simple and more effective method to monitor soil moisture in Tibet with higher spatial resolution at 500m in comparison with VSWI at 1000m resolution.

AB  - Sun glint, the specular reflection of light from water surfaces, is a serious confounding factor for remote sensing of bathymetric measurements and benthic habitat mapping. In remote sensing of water color and water temperature, image saturation is one of the main noises of water color satellite images due to the influence of solar reflection. Therefore, sun glint correction is an important part of marine satellite image preprocessing. The existing high resolution satellite image flare elimination algorithm exploit the high absorption of water at NIR wavelengths and the consequence that the water-leaving radiance for these bands can be assumed negligible. Since the Fresnel reflectance of water is only weakly dependent on wavelength the strengths of the glint signal at visible and NIR wavelengths will vary in the same way, so the NIR signal can be used to indicate the amount of glint at visible wavelengths. In this paper, the WorldView-2 satellite 8 band remote sensing image is selected as the research area in the South China Sea region. The effects and differences of four kinds of solar flare elimination algorithms are compared. The main research contents and conclusions are as follows: firstly, four kinds of lighting elimination algorithms are introduced, including the method of: (1) Hedley et al.; (2) Lyzenga et al. (3) fixed coefficient; (4) coordinate axis rotation. Then, the radiometric calibration of the satellite images in the study area is carried out, and different algorithms are used to correct the solar flare. Finally, the results of the algorithms are compared and analyzed. The results show that the four lighting elimination algorithms have good visual effects. The bright spots in the original image decrease with the wave fluctuation, and the texture features that are originally covered under water can be revealed. In addition, the radiance value curve before and after the solar flare correction is analyzed. It is found that the values of each wave band after correction are basically reduced, the overall fluctuation of the curve is reduced, and the high frequency change decreases. Compared with other methods, the method of coordinate axis rotation has the best correction effect.

AB  - The radiometric performance of the reflective solar bands (RSBs) of NOAA-20 VIIRS, recently launched on 18 November 2017, is evaluated through an intercomparison with Aqua MODIS. The analysis adapts a "nadir-only" refinement of the simultaneous nadir overpass (SNO) to generate comparison time series for assessment of the on-orbit calibration of NOAA-20 VIIRS RSBs using the official sensor data records (SDRs). The comparison result reveals an unstable and varying early radiometric performance upward of 5%. SNPP VIIRS, the precursor VIIRS, is also used to generate a comparison time series against Aqua MODIS. The result shows that NOAA-20 VIIRS RSBs have a 2 to 8% radiometric deficit relative to SNPP VIIRS RSBs.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent abundance of moderate-to-high spatial resolution satellite imagery has facilitated land-cover map production. However, in cloud-prone areas, building high-resolution land-cover maps is still challenging due to infrequent satellite revisits and lack of cloud-free data. We propose a classification method for cloud-persistent areas with high temporal dynamics of land-cover types. First, compositing techniques are employed to create dense time-series composite images from all available Landsat 8 images. Then, spectral-temporal features are extracted to train an ensemble of five supervised classifiers. The resulting composite images are clear with at least 99.78% cloud-free pixels and are 20.47% better than their original images on average. We classify seven land classes, including paddy rice, cropland, grass/shrub, trees, bare land, impervious area, and waterbody over Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2016. Using a time series of composites significantly improves the classification performance with 10.03% higher overall accuracy (OA) compared to single composite classifications. Additionally, using time series of composites and the ensemble technique, which combines the best of five experimented classifiers (eXtreme Gradient Boosting, logistic regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel - SVM-RBF and Linear kernel - SVM-Linear, multilayer perceptron), performed best with 84% OA and 0.79 kappa coefficient.

AB  - This research examines the image of Koshchei in Russian folklore. The goal of this research is to clarify what kind of character Koshchei is, where he comes from and what kind of characteristics his realm shows. Ultimately this research attempts to define how these characteristics of Koshchei reflect the similarities and differences between the Russian folkloristic worldview and the Korean one. For this purpose this research compares and analyzes Russian folktales such as “Koshchei the Immortal,” “The Frog Princess,” “The Three Underground Kingdoms,” “Maria Morevna” and the Korean folktale “The Legend of Eliminating the Great Thief of the Underworld.” In these folktales, the male protagonist, in order to retrieve the abducted female protagonist, travels to an underground realm or another world, goes through numerous adventures, rescues the female protagonist and returns to his own world. In most of the abduction tales the male protagonist is the sole hero. However, in the Koshchei stories of Russia and in the Great Thief of the Underworld story in Korea, the male protagonist needs the female protagonist’s help in order to discover the secret to kill the monster. The Russian Koshchei tales reflect the mythical worldview of the ancient Slavs and the origin of Koshchei as a fallen god. Among various, structurally similar abduction tales, the Koshchei story stands out because of its unique mythical roots.

AB  - As an ecological barrier between the Badain Jaran Desert and Tengger Desert, Qingtu Lake plays an important role in maintaining the local ecological environment. Since 2010, animal artificial water transport to Qingtu Lake has caused changes in local vegetation communities, which is of great ecological significance for promoting regional vegetation restoration. In this study, Landsat satellite remote sensing images from 2010 to 2017 were used to compare the water surface area, vegetation coverage, and spatial patterns of Phragmites australis communities before and after ecological water transport. The results showed that the water surface area increased rapidly until 2016, and the growth rate of the last two years decreased. There was a slight increase in total regional vegetation coverage, which mainly occurred in the water area due to the substantial growth in P. australis. Therefore, artificial ecological water transport promoted the growth in vegetation around the lake, especially the aquatic vegetation, such as P. australis. However, the original desert vegetation in the study area may have been reduced due to submergence.

TI  - Seasonality of the vertical distribution of chlorophyll-a in the sublatitudinal zones of the Antarctic part of the Atlantic according to direct and remote sensing data
T2  - Trudy VNIRO
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the results of the analysis of 469 chlorophyll a profiles obtained from the buoys of the project Biogeochemical-Argo from May 7, 2015 to May 14, 2018 in the Drake Passage and the open part of the Scotia Sea between 53-65 degrees S, 40-70 degrees W. Profiles led to standard horizons. It was noted that during the period under review it became possible to trace the dynamics of seasonal changes in the concentration of chlorophyll-a in four sublatitudinal zones. In the area under consideration, phytoplankton reached its highest development in December, in the SFZ (Secondary frontal zone) the maximum values reached 4.11 mg/m(3), the lowest concentration of chlorophyll-a was observed in August, while the lowest values of the maximum were also observed in the SFZ and were 0.16 mg/m(3). According to the dynamics of the variability of the curves of chlorophyll values, the similarity between the SASM (sub-antarctic surface water mass) and SPFZ (South polar frontal zone) zones and between AZ (Antarctic zone) and SFZ is highlighted. In the areas of SASM and SPFZ, the range of values of the chlorophyll-a maximum during the year was less (0.22-3.45 mg/m(3)) than in the southern regions, the second peak was in May. AZ and SFZ had similar pronounced seasonal differences, the values of chlorophyll content in the maximum zone ranged from 0.09-8.02 mg/m(3), the second peak was observed in February. Surface maxima were observed in 33.9% of cases, mainly in the winter period in the area of the SASM. The difference between the surface values and the values in the layer of the maximum in the winter period for all zones was 5-12%, in the summer period in the SASM and AZ reached 48%. As a trend, an increase in the average maximum depth from February (37 m) to October (15.5 m) was observed.

CL  - Coimbra, PORTUGAL
AB  - Biomass burnings (including forest, grassland, peatland and agricultural fires) have important impacts on global terrestrial and atmospheric systems, affecting land cover, surface albedo, and the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, chemically reactive species and aerosols. Several products have been generated in the last years to estimate total burned area, but uncertainties remain, particularly those associated to small and low intensity fires. Impact of climate and societal changes modify traditional fire regimes, extending fire seasons, increasing fire severity or introducing fire in sensitive areas.The Fire_cci project of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative aims to generate consistent time series of burned area products to assess the extent of biomass burnings, as well as their spatial and temporal characteristics. Fire impacts on atmospheric and terrestrial processes are assessed, including modifications of vegetation patterns and biomass availability. The global burned area products of the Fire_cci program currently available are derived from MERIS FRS and MODIS 250m sensors and cover the period from 2001 to 2016.These global burned area products are complemented with a small-fire database generated from medium resolution sensors (Sentinel-2 and Sentinel 1) for the African continent. BA algorithms for new Sentinel-3 sensors (OLCI and SLSTR) are also being developed. Validation of the global products is based on a statistical sampling design of 1200 Landsat scenes.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Geographically Weighted Inverse Regression (3GWR) Model for Satellite Derived Bathymetry Using Sentinel-2 Observations
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current trends of development of satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) models rely on applying calibration techniques including analytical approaches, neuro-fuzzy systems, regression optimization and others. In most of the cases, the SDB models are calibrated and verified for test sites, that provide favorable conditions for the remote derivation of bathymetry such as high water clarity, homogenous bottom type, low amount of sediment in the water and other factors. In this paper, a novel 3-dimensional geographical weighted regression (3GWR) SDB technique is presented, it binds together methods already presented in other studies, the geographically weighted local regression (GWR) model, with depth dependent inverse optimization. The proposed SDB model was calibrated and verified on a relatively difficult test site of the South Baltic near-shore areas with the use of multispectral observations acquired by a recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite observation system. By conducted experiments, it was shown that the proposed SDB model is capable of obtaining satisfactory results of RMSE ranging from 0.88 to 1.23[m] depending on the observation and can derive bathymetry for depths up to 12m. It was also shown, that the proposed approach may be used operationally, for instance, in the continuous assessment of temporal bathymetry changes, for areas important in the context of ensuring local maritime safety.

CL  - Milan, ITALY
AB  - In this paper a set of spectral indices, some of them novel, is suggested in order to effectively process multispectral images, from the NASA and ESA missions Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, for fire monitoring. The processing aims at extract common products, useful to detect active fires and evaluate the position and extension of the burned areas. The use of open data in comparison with other paid solutions is to remark because of great interest to public and private end users.The thresholding of the proposed indices produces satisfactory results in terms of classification accuracy. Moreover, the joint use of images from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, by increasing the overall availability of data, allows also to overcome some limitations on time delivery and high frequency observation, requirements that instead are goodly matched through the use of lower resolution multispectral images such as those from MODIS and VIIRS satellites.The proposed indices have been successfully tested on Vesuvius, that was devastated by terrible fires on the of 11th July 2017. Respect to other works of the same authors on this topic, the performance of the suggested indices are here more deeply investigated, comparing them to alternative products.

AB  - The influenza Sentinel surveillance system is a source of valuable data about the dynamics of epidemic seasons in Poland. During the epidemic season 2016/2017, more than 1,000 samples were examined, of which 48% were positive for influenza diagnosis. The predominance of influenza A/H3N2/was confirmed. Influenza B viruses were noted in only 1% of the samples tested. After the analysis in age groups, the highest number of positive samples was observed in the group of 26-44 years. Infections caused by influenza-like viruses were confirmed only in 3% of cases. The Sentinel surveillance system makes it possible to evaluate the spread of the influenza virus in each epidemic season.

AB  - During the last years, the world of free/open source geospatial data and software has seen a rapid growth. This development lead to an abundance of spatial data, mapping and understanding the features and phenomena found on the surface of the Earth, became easier. Worldwide natural hazards like floods are a constant threat to build up environment or agricultural areas. Due to their negative impact on different social and economic aspects, the need to monitor and map these phenomena has become mandatory. One of the most used methodologies in the assessment of flooded areas is the use of remote sensing. With the recent developments in this field, especially in the microwave wavelength data acquisition, the monitoring, mapping and modeling of these catastrophic events can be done in a more rapid and precise way. The optimal solution for monitoring and mapping flooded areas is the use of radar data (SAR). The development of ESA Sentinel-1 mission, which will provide free data (radar with 10 m spatial resolution and a revision time of 5 days in constellation mode), set a new milestone in the flood hazard and risk assessment. This paper proposes a methodology for mapping flood events using open source data Sentinel-1 provided by ESA (European Space Agency) and SNAP, an open source ESA software architecture.

TI  - GORKY AND "THE GOSPEL OF THE NEW FAITH"
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - M. Gorky's position towards defining the socialist realism is complex and in order to understand it correctly one must analyse his intellectual, political and literary evolution as a whole. Gorky felt "the need to enrich both the economical and socio-political aspects of Marxism with morally-ethical and philosophically-religious meaning" and was exhilarated by his deep belief in man. His understanding of Marxism happened via his perception of Nietzsche and therefore his views were based on romantic, Nietzschean worldview. During his visit to the United States Gorky for the first time defined socialism as the future religion of humanity that will free the world of poverty and the reign of wealth. Gorky would remain faithful to these ideas his whole life. It was no accident that Gorky chose his article "The disintegration of Personality" printed in 1909 in the "Essays on the Philosophy of Collectivism" collection, which was refused by Lenin for including the dangerous ideas of Bogdanov and later in 1934 fully accepted by Stalin, for his speech at the First Soviet Writers' Congress. Here the religion of humanity, redeemed by the mysticism of labor, emerges again. This idea captivated him during his friendship with Lunacharsky. In order to fit in the new Party ideology Gorky didn't have to reorganize himself. He sees no anarchistic threat in the peasantry controlled by Stalin's policy, like in 1917, but rather a possibility of long-awaited difficult cultural redemption. The idea of socialist industrialization of Russia was more appealing to Gorky than Lenin's idea of the revolution. Socialist realism, as writes Cesare De Michelis has many points in common with the Russian religious tradition. In this context, the Gorky's speech on the first Soviet Writers' Congress, which "instead of complying with Lenin's ideology was based on "heresy", heavily criticized by Lenin before, "the God Building", was a reflection of traditional Russian religiousness that Joseph Vissarionovich (Stalin), former trainee priest, understood perfectly. During the First Soviet Writers' Congress it became obvious that the idea of "God-building", developed in the novel "Confession", was reborn in Gorky's speech, although in a clouded but still recognizable way. The publicist success of the speech led to its incorrect understanding. Speaking about Gorky as "the founder of socialist realism" without referencing to the evolution of his literary and artistic position would be an unforgivable simplification that can distort the real picture.

TI  - Figurative 'eye' expressions in the conceptualization of emotions and personality traits in Slovak
T2  - JEZIKOSLOVLJE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores metonymic and metaphoric expressions with the lexeme 'eye' and provides empirical evidence from the Slovak language about the close interaction between the physiological and cultural aspects of the embodied mind. Our study, relying on data collected from several Slovak dictionaries, demonstrates the importance of the organ of sight in the conceptualization of various emotions (anger, happiness, sadness, love, hate, envy, surprise, and fear) and personality traits (honesty, greed, and hostility), all considered to be essential parts of the Slovak linguistic worldview. The identification of specific metonymic and/or metaphorical mappings has shed more light on the emergence and motivation of particular figurative expressions in Slovak. In the investigation of the linguistic data, the traditional Lakovian approach was used alongside the more recent anthropologically-oriented methodological approaches of Polish and Russian schools of cognitive semantics. Both contemporary and etymological meanings of multilayered emotion concepts were analyzed, and their hierarchical organization was presented in an associativesemantic network. It has been shown that there are no obvious boundaries between the concepts - rather the opposite, as the network illustrates their internal continuity. By revealing the complexities of the creation of new meanings via associations, this paper contributes towards a deeper understanding of the relationship between figurative language, culture, and human thought.

AB  - This article examines the changing framework for producing satellite weather data in the United States since the 2000s, from a government function to one increasingly carried out by the private sector. It explores the controversial attempts to commercialize the production of a particular data source (atmospheric profiles obtained with radio occultation) from the perspective of executives of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), members of Congress, atmospheric and climate scientists, and the private sector. It addresses their opposing arguments by focusing, in particular, on the stresses and pressures within NOAA and its resistance to acquiring such data from commercial providers. In so doing, the article discusses the connections between commercial activities and meteorology and, more generally, the relations between science and commerce.

AB  - In the article the novel implementation of bias correction and data assimilation using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) were presented. These methods applied as a pre-processor suitable for integration into the conceptual rainfall-runoff HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning) model were assessed for hydrological modelling based on seasonal hydrographs. The enhanced HBV model was able to generate an ensemble (interval) hydrographs and averaged streamflow simulation. The proposed system, which was constructed to examine the possibility of employing EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) data (e.g., precipitation and soil moisture), was shown to be useful in improving model updating and forecasting. Data from the Sola River mountain part of southern Poland, was used. A bias correction algorithm for a distribution derived transformation method was also developed by exploring Generalized Exponential (GE) theoretical distributions, along with Gamma (GA) and Weibull (WE) distributions on the different data used in this study. In order to remove biases in the ensemble of soil moisture the bias correction within the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF-BC) was used as a post-processing technique. In terms of the precipitation and soil moisture satellite outputs, the EnKF-BC pre-processed HBV models significantly improved the accuracy of the simulated hydrographs in the summer season, while the positive effect of the corrected satellite precipitation was seen in the winter.

AB  - Rice is the single most important crop for food security in Asia. Knowledge about the distribution of rice fields is also relevant in the context of greenhouse-relevant methane emissions, disease transmission, and water resource management. Copernicus Sentinel-1 provides the first openly available archive of C-band SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data at high spatial and temporal resolution. We developed one of the first methods that shows the potential of this data for accurate and timely mapping of rice-growing areas. We used superpixel segmentation to create spatially averaged backscatter time series, which is robust to speckle and reduces the amount of data to process. This method has been applied to six study sites in different rice-growing regions of the world and achieved an average overall accuracy of 0.83.

AB  - We have entered an era in which we are threatened simultaneously by a revivified cold war and the ongoing calamity of climate change. I argue in this article that now is a good time to revisit J. G. Ballard's 1962 novel The Drowned World. In its intertextual landscape, we find two real ruined cities (Hiroshima and New Orleans) that symbolize our two concurrent human-made eschatological threats. And revisiting The Drowned World now offers a timely reminder of the dangers of an anthropocentric worldview. Furthermore, this postapocalyptic story presents at least two ethically sound responses to the human-made crises we are complicit in creating. The Drowned World remains as relevant now as when it was written more than half a century ago.

AB  - Livestock productivity is likely to be adversely affected by climate change mainly in terms of feed supply variations. Principal livestock food resources in Zambia and Malawi are grass areas, but very few data are available for supply management and amount estimation. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the procedure adopted for preliminary estimations of grassland biomass retrieval and grass growth cycle identification over a wide area between the Lukulu District and the Mongu District, West Zambia, for the period 1996-2016. The procedure takes advantage of remote sensing observations from multiple sensors and neural networks. The preliminary results obtained are in accordance with the expectations and the seasonal variation is clearly visible in the growth cycles.

TI  - S2check: a tool for quality control of sentinel-2 products
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With more than 4 TB of data acquired every day, the Sentinel 2 mission poses new challenges for quality control (QC). To support the QC operations of Sentinel 2, a dedicated tool has been developed for improved efficiency and traceability of analyses. This tool aims at helping visual inspection by human operators through automatic product retrieval, generation of quicklook images and production of quality indicators.The article describes the product sampling strategy used to select products suitable for quality control checks. Then we present the methodology used to generate quicklooks, compute relative and multi-spectral co-registration performance. The final step is the production of end-to-end service performance indicators.Lessons learnt from the first year of operation of this tool are presented regarding detected product anomalies and measured performance trends.

TI  - "Orangeism, A Great Protestant Crusade": The Nativist Legacy of the Orange Order in the Northeastern Borderlands
T2  - AMERICAN REVIEW OF CANADIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Orange Order was central to Canadian nativism throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Formed in 1795 by Protestants who feared the specter of Catholic influence and political involvement in Irish society, the Order protected British authority in Ireland. Its advocacy for British loyalism and Protestant hegemony made it attractive to the growing populace in Anglophone British North America following the American Revolution. The chronological focus of this article will be in the 1920s and 1930s, a period of nativist upsurge decades after the violent heyday of the Order documented in works like Scott See's Riots in New Brunswick: Orange Nativism and Social Violence in the 1840s. It will explore the Orange Order's legacy in New Brunswick, demonstrating its longevity as an anti-Catholic organization and its role in fostering the social acceptance of nativist ideology in the Northeastern borderlands long after the violent 1840s. It will present the Order as an ideological advocate for an ethno-religious strain of identity that espoused Anglo-Saxon Protestant hegemony across the Northeast and collaborated with establishment politicians and fellow nativist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan to enforce this hegemonic worldview in New Brunswick.

AB  - Bathymetry, as a key parameter for evaluation of available resources of renewable marine energy, can be extracted from high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar images acquired by Sentinel-1. In this paper, the high repetitiveness of these acquisitions is used to improve the accuracy of bathymetric maps extracted from SAR images. A method to extract wavelengths from the free surface elevations was developed, through experiments made using a phase-resolving wave propagation model (Boussinesq Ocean & Surf Zone model). It makes use of several different swell conditions propagating over the same bathymetry. The retrieved bathymetry is established by averaging the different bathymetric maps, obtained from different swell conditions. It allows obtaining a Root Mean Square Error of order 4.5 m for depths 10 m to 50 m.Twenty SAR images on a particular region have been processed using this methodology. The extraction of wavelengths and peak periods on each image led to a first estimation of the bathymetric data of this specific region compared to an actual bathymetric map with a 20 m spatial resolution. All these maps have been averaged to create a final bathymetric map with a 50 m spatial resolution and a vertical accuracy given by the RMSE over the entire domain of study of about 2.6 m. These preliminary results are encouraging. Future tracks are proposed for improving these results.

TI  - Ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast - Long term results from a twenty-year cohort.
T2  - Cancer treatment and research communications
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Long-term survival is excellent in ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS); whether or not we are over-treating DCIS has been a major public concern. This study aims at reviewing the long-term survival outcome of DCIS and identifying adverse prognosticators for DCIS.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients treated for DCIS between 1st January 1997 and 31st December 2016 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the adverse factors for surgical margin involvement and local recurrence RESULTS: 3042 female patients were treated for breast cancer over the 20-year study period, of which 203 (6.7%) had DCIS in final pathology. The median age of diagnosis was 53 year-old (Range 30-85). 57 (28.1%) were detected by screening mammogram, 101 had breast mass on presentation. 132 (65%) patients received mastectomy and the remaining received breast conserving surgery (BCS); Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 86 (42.4%) patients. 19 (9.4%) patients had positive resection margin, 18 were re-operated for clear resection margin. Multivariate analysis found that high grade DCIS is the only independent risk factors for margin involvement (HR 2.55, 95% CI 1.02-6.42). After median follow-up of 106 months (6-223 months), the overall survival was 97%. 4 (2%) patients developed local recurrence. Multivariate analysis found that positive surgical margin is the only independent factor of local recurrence (HR 9.58, 95% CI 1.43-64.18).CONCLUSION: High grade DCIS is associated with increased risk of surgical margin involvement which is in turn an independent factor of local recurrence.

AB  - With a continuous increase in multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, leading to enable mapping applications for Earth environmental observation, the number of algorithms for detection of different types of terrain changes has greatly expanded. In this paper, a SAR image change detection method based on normalized compression distance (NCD) is proposed. The procedure mainly consists in dividing two time series images in patches, computing a collection of similarities corresponding to each pair of patches and generating the change map with a histogram-based threshold. The experimental results were computed using 2 Sentinel 1A images over the city of Bucharest, Romania and 2 TerraSAR-X images over the Elbe River and its surrounding area, Germany.

AB  - from pr: #121 commits from: @prisae review from: @lheagy Expand plot_3d_slicer Addresses #116 . Bug fix First, it contains a minor bug-fix in the scrolling behavior (last element in each direction was not acceptable, only noticeable in small grids). vType Included all non-vector vType's: CC, Ex, Ey, Ez, Fx, Fy, Fz. view Included all view's except vec (real [default]; imag; abs; tested them all, seems to be fine). Name-clash There is a problem with the view-parameter, which I stupidly used to switch the x-y-axis. I changed the previous view-parameter to axis (hence axis='xy' or 'yx'). It is better to change this than to have different parameters as, for instance, in plotSlice. I added a switch for backwards-compatibility (if view in ['xy', 'yx'] =[greater than] it sets axis = view; view = 'real'). Copyright: Open Access

AB  - Internal waves in the ocean occur in stably stratified fluids when a water parcel is vertically displaced by some external forcing and is restored by buoyancy forces. A specific case of such internal waves is internal tides and their associated currents. These currents can be significant in areas where internal waves degenerate into nonlinear solitary waves, known as solitons.Solitons are potentially hazardous for offshore engineering constructions, such as oil/gas pipelines and floating platforms. The most efficient mechanism of soliton generation is the tidal energy conversion from barotropic to baroclinic component over large-scale oceanic bottom obstructions (shelf breaks, seamounts, canyons and ridges).In this paper, a methodology is provided to compute diagnostics and prognostics for soliton generation and propagation, including the associated currents. The methodology comprises a diagnostic tool which, through the use of a set of theoretical and empirical formulations, selects areas where solitons are likely to occur. These theoretical and empirical formulations include the computation of the integral body force (1), the linear wave theory to compute the phase speed and the empirical model proposed by (2). After the selection procedure, the tool provides initial and boundary conditions for non hydrostatic numerical models. The numerical models run in 2D-V configuration (vertical slices) with horizontal and vertical resolutions ranging from 50 to 200 m and 5 to 10 m, respectively. Examples are provided for an open ocean location over the Mascarene Plateau in the Indian Ocean. Validation of diagnostics and prognostics are provided against ADCP and satellite data.

AB  - Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms are the most common form of harmful algal blooms in freshwater systems throughout the world. However, in situ sampling of cyanobacteria in inland lakes is limited both spatially and temporally. Satellite data has proven to be an effective tool to monitor cyanobacteria in freshwater lakes across the United States. This study uses data from the European Space Agency MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument to provide a national overview of the percentage of lakes experiencing a cyanobacterial bloom on a weekly basis for 2008-2011 and 2017. A total of 2,370 lakes across the contiguous United States were included in the analysis. Bloom percentage was calculated for nine United States climate regions to examine regional patterns. Changes in cyanobacterial bloom percentage followed the well-known temporal pattern of freshwater blooms. The percentage of lakes experiencing a bloom increased throughout the year, reached a peak around October, and decreased through the winter. Wintertime data, particularly in the northern latitude regions, was consistently limited due to snow and ice cover. With the exception of the Southeast and South climate regions, regional patterns mimicked patterns found at the national scale. The Southeast and South regions exhibited an unexpected pattern as cyanobacterial bloom percentage peaked in the winter rather than the summer. Several environmental factors and potential satellite limitations can possibly explain these findings. Results from this research can help establish a baseline of annual occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in inland lakes across the United States.

AB  - Coastline extraction is a fundamental work for coastal resource management and coastal environmental protection. Today, by using digital image processing techniques, coastline extraction can be done with remote sensing imagery systems. In this study, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imagery (OLI) data have been the main data source due to free access and sufficient spatial resolution for coast line extraction. This research is focused on determining the coastline length and measuring land area by using Landsat 8 OLI satellite image for Bodrum Peninsula, Turkey. Three commonly used methods have been applied in order to determine sea-land boundary line and its length, and area of the study area. The Automatic Water Extraction Index (AWEI), Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) unsupervised classification technique and on screen digitizing method was chosen for identification of coastal boundaries. Results of coastline length and land areas of Bodrum by using AWEI, ISODATA and on-screen digitizing are compared with each other. This study shows that with using optimal threshold value, AWEI can be used for coast line extraction method with coherently for Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery. The overall results show that coastline extraction from satellite imagery can be done with sufficient accuracy using spectral water indices instead of time consuming on-screen digitizing.

AB  - Background: Schemas to identify bleeding-related hospitalizations in claims data differ in billing codes used and coding positions allowed. We assessed agreement across bleeding-related hospitalization coding schemas for claims analyses of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients on oral anticoagulation (OAC).Hypothesis: We hypothesized that prior coding schemas used to identify bleeding-related hospitalizations in claim database studies would provide varying levels of agreement in incidence rates.Methods: Within MarketScan data, we identified adults, newly started on OAC for NVAF from January 2012 to June 2015. Billing code schemas developed by Cunningham et al., the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Mini-Sentinel program, and Yao et al. were used to identify bleeding-related hospitalizations as a surrogate for major bleeding. Bleeds were subcategorized as intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), gastrointestinal (GI), or other. Schema agreement was assessed by comparing incidence, rates of events/100 person-years (PYs), and Cohen's kappa statistic.Results: We identified 151 738 new- users of OAC with NVAF (CHA2DS2-VASc score = 3, [interquartile range = 2-4] and median HAS-BLED score = 3 [interquartile range = 2-3]). The Cunningham, FDA Mini-Sentinel, and Yao schemas identified any bleeding-related hospitalizations in 1.87% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.81-1.94), 2.65% (95% CI: 2.57-2.74), and 4.66% (95% CI: 4.55-4.76) of patients (corresponding rates = 3.45, 4.90, and 8.65 events/100 PYs). Kappa agreement across schemas was weak-to-moderate (kappa = 0.47-0.66) for any bleeding hospitalization. Near-perfect agreement (kappa = 0.99) was observed with the FDA Mini-Sentinel and Yao schemas for ICH-related hospitalizations, but agreement was weak when comparing Cunningham to FDA Mini-Sentinel or Yao (kappa = 0.52-0.53). FDA Mini-Sentinel and Yao agreement was moderate (kappa = 0.62) for GI bleeding, but agreement was weak when comparing Cunningham to FDA Mini-Sentinel or Yao (kappa= 0.44-0.56). For other bleeds, agreement across schemas was minimal (kappa = 0.14-0.38).Conclusions: We observed varying levels of agreement among 3 bleeding-related hospitalizations schemas in NVAF patients.

TI  - Satellite-based salt marsh elevation, vegetation height, and species composition mapping using the superspectral WorldView-3 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high resolution (VHR) space-borne data are needed to finely and continuously map salt marshes. The WorldView-3 (WV-3) sensor leverages one panchromatic, eight optical, and eight shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands at 0.31, 1.24, and 7.5m pixel size, respectively. Although eight optical bands have been previously pansharpened, no attempt to use the 16-band superspectral data set at VHR (0.31m) has been yet reviewed. Here, we propose to reliably pan-sharpen the 16 WV-3 predictors so as to model (artificial neural network, ANN) salt marsh elevation and vegetation height and classify species composition at VHR using calibration/validation handheld vegetation height, airborne lidar elevation, and drone blue-green-red (BGR) responses. Three models have been created over a megatidal bay (Beaussais Bay, Brittany, France) provided with mud flats, salt marshes, and polders. VHR-screened WV-3 bands very satisfactorily predicted salt marsh elevation and vegetation height responses (r=0.86, R-2=0.71, root mean square error (RMSE)=0.33m and r=0.88, R-2=0.77, RMSE=5.72 cm, respectively). The WV-3 superspectral data set outperformed the eight-band multispectral and four-band traditional data sets to classify 15 salt marsh habitats (OA=95.47, 82.33, and 69.27%, respectively). Adding WV-3-based salt marsh elevation and vegetation height augmented the 15-class classification of the superspectral and traditional data sets (OA=97.60 and 77.47%, respectively), but not for the multispectral one (OA=81.93%).

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability of Arctic Soil Moisture Detected from High-Resolution RADARSAT-2 SAR Data
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Various methods are used to determine soil moisture information from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, but none specific to High Arctic regions and their unique physical characteristics. This research presents a method for determining, at high spatial and temporal resolutions, surface soil moisture and its changes through time in the Canadian high Arctic. An artificial neural network (ANN) is implemented using input variables derived from RADARSAT-2 SAR data and previously modelled surface roughness information. The model is applied to SAR data collected at various incidence angles and acquisition dates across two study sites on Melville Island, Nunavut. The model results in absolute soil moisture errors of approximately 15% (r(2) = 0.46) for the primary study sites and 12% (r(2) = 0.26) for the verification study area. The ANN model is accurate for modelling (i) the spatial distribution of soil moisture and (ii) the changes in moisture through time across the study areas, two characteristics that are very important for inputs to hydrologic or climate models. In addition, the models appear to be scalable when applied at coarser spatial resolutions, showing potential for large-area mapping or modelling.

AB  - Improving seasonal influenza forecasting combining official data sources with web search and social media is a recent research topic which can enhance situational awareness of healthcare organizations when monitoring the outbreak of seasonal flu. In this paper, a prediction model based on autoregression that combines data coming from official influenza surveillance system, with data from web search and social media regarding influenza is proposed. The model is evaluated on the two influenza seasons 2016-2017 and 2017-2018, restricted to Italy. The results show that by using Web-based social data, like Google search queries and tweets, we can obtain accurate weekly influenza predictions up to four weeks in advance. The proposed approach improves real-time influenza forecast compared to traditional surveillance systems based on data from sentinel doctors: the prediction error is reduced up to 47%, while the Pearson's correlation is improved of about 24%.

AB  - In this paper we summarize the results of an experiment aiming to compare soil moisture estimates obtained by Sentinel-1 interferometric data with in-situ measurements. The study area, located close to Lisbon in Companhia das Lezirias, Portugal is characterized by a flat topography, large agricultural areas and sparse vegetation. In a test site, four soil moisture sensors were deployed and soil moisture was measured (at a depth of 5 cm) for a period of 7 months in an hourly basis. For the same interval of time and with a temporal resolution of 6 days C-band Sentinel-1 SAR images were interferometrically processed and coherence, phase and phase triplet images were derived. The in-situ soil moisture measurements have been used to predict the analytical interferometric phases, coherences and phase triplets and compared with the measured interferometric phases in both VV and VH polarimetric channels. As a further analysis, a regression analysis of in-situ soil moisture measurement and Sentinel-1 backscattering images has been carried out.

CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - In this work we study the problem of mapping soil moisture by means of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. A test site has been set in Companhia das Lezirias, close to Lisbon, Portugal. The main advantage of using SAR images is their capability to map soil moisture at a very high spatial resolution. This opens interesting perspectives for agricultural applications, where soil moisture can abruptly change across field boundaries depending on the agricultural practices. The study area is characterized by flat topography, large agricultural areas and sparse vegetation. Five sensors have been deployed in a test area to measure soil moisture with a sampling time of one hour for a period of seven months. In-situ measurements are compared with the results obtained by processing 33 C-band Sentinel-1 images using the SAR interferometry technique. The aim of the study is to analyze the relation between the interferometric phase and time varying soil moisture. The main advantage of SAR interferometry with respect to the use of radar cross-section is that the information about soil moisture can be recovered using a reduced number of in-situ measurements. In particular, we combine three interferograms obtained from three SAR images, acquired over the same area at different times, to derive maps of bi-coherence and phase triplet. This last quantity allows to disentangle the phase contribution due to soil moisture from those related to microwave propagation in atmosphere and terrain displacements. Results are compared to those obtained using the interferometric phase and coherence to emphasize the importance to split the effects due to propagation (e.g. atmosphere) from those related to volume scattering.

TI  - Primary extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma with adenofibroma of the breast: a case report and literatures review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Primary extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) of the breast has been rarely reported. In the present study, the clinical feature, imaging result, pathology, treatment and prognosis of a patient with primary EMC and adenofibroma of the breast were analyzed. A 50-year-old menopausal woman presented at hospital with complaints of the masses in her breasts. Breast ultrasound revealed several masses were found in bilateral breasts. The largest one located at lower outer quadrant in right breast with a clear boundary, irregular shape, uneven echo and blood flow signals, which was 3.3 cm in diameter. Mammography showed multiple nodules were found in bilateral breasts, and most of the boundaries were clear. The largest mass located in the outer quadrant measured 3.0 cm x 3.1 cm in the right breast. After sufficient preparation, the patient received mastectomy in right breast and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Microscopic examination confirmed the largest tumor located in the lower outer quadrant of the right breast was EMC and the tumors in the right outer and upper quadrant were adenofibroma with calcification. The nipple and lymph nodes were not involved. Immunohistochemical staining indicated the EMC were positive for vimentin, S-100 protein, P53 (+ 80%), Ki67 (+ 40%), and focal positive for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, but negative for cytokeratin 5/6, cytokeratin-H, cytokeratin-L, P63, calponin, smooth muscle actin, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Post operation, the patient did not receive any other treatment and followed up for 18 months, no tumor recurrence and distant metastasis was found.

M3  - Article
AB  - In an earlier contribution on the use of the term `worldview' in various theological discourses I commented on the confusing connotations attached to the term in neo-Calvinism, the sociology of knowledge, African theology, 'science and theology' and 'religion and ecology'. 1 This contribution builds on that earlier one by raising the question whether the category of 'worldviews' can perhaps help to hold together the categories of evolution and religion - while doing justice also to an ecological awareness. 2 The conclusion is a negative one, namely that this is unlikely, given the conceptual confusion over what a 'worldview' entails. Nevertheless, it at least indicates the terrain where contestation takes place.

TI  - Skin Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the trunk and limbs: Role of Sentinel Node Biopsy in its staging
T2  - REVISTA COLOMBIANA DE CANCEROLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is associated with a more aggressive biological behaviour in the presence of risk factors. High risk SCC may present with lymph node metastasis in 21% of patients, with the consequent reduction in overall survival. The physical examination lymph nodes can have a false-negative rate between 15% and 39%, thus requiring the need to find new diagnostic tool allows a more precise evaluation of lymph node involvement. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been reported in case series of patients with head and neck SCC, and genital SCC, but there are few case reports about skin SCC of the trunk and extremities. The aim of this review is to describe the indications and feasibility of using sentinel lymph node biopsy to assess lymph node status in patients with skin SCC of trunk and limbs.

T2  - REVESCO-REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS COOPERATIVOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's indigenous population suffers poverty and exclusion, and there is little literature that addresses the economic component from its worldview; particularly in Latin America from the perspective of good living. The objectives of this article are to determine the economic elements of Sumak Kawsay as an alternative to development, and the contributions of indigenous entrepreneurship to their community through a qualitative approach in the Ecuadorian Amazon. We build our results based on information obtained through 22 semistructured interviews in the context of the cooperative of 850 families from the Kallari community, dedicated mainly to the production, marketing and export of organic cocoa and fine aroma chocolate. Participation, food sovereignty and the fight against poverty are the result of the joint work of Kallari, which serves as a guide for other indigenous communities to strengthen their organizations with periphery-center approaches. The study concludes with the importance of the sustainability of the project, calling the attention to the governments on the importance of the political participation of the indigenous communities in the construction of public policies focused on the specific needs of their territories.

AB  - This article presents an experiment in which multi-temporal interferometric coherence calculated from 6-days Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B image pairs and backscatter intensity sigma degrees are jointly used for the extraction of built-up areas in the framework of the symbolic machine learning classification. The results obtained with the proposed approach confirm the enhanced capabilities of discriminating built-up areas when using coherence information in comparison to two available global human settlement layers derived: (1) from Landsat optical data and (2) from Sentinel-1 ground range detected data and based on backscatter intensity s degrees only. The experiment carried out in The Netherlands Randstad area is expected to be indicative of the results obtainable for urban areas having similar structures and types of built-up.

AB  - In this study, typhoon monitoring is addressed using X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery collected by the German TerraSAR-X mission and the Italian COSMO-SkyMed constellation during the typhoon Megi. Geometrical features, rain rate, and wind speed associated with the typhoon are retrieved by the SAR data set. One of the key benefits of the X-band observations relies in their sensitivity to rain that can be exploited to provide an estimate of geometrical features and rain rate by analyzing attenuation bands present in the SAR data. In addition, wind speed is retrieved using a rain-free model based on two geophysical model functions (GMFs) and experimental results show that the nonlinear relationship between normalized radar cross section and wind speed provided by one of the GMFs can be exploited to provide a rough estimate of high wind speeds.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - In this study, the azimuth cut-off approach, which is typically adopted to estimate wind speed from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery collected under nominal wind conditions, is discussed with respect to high wind regime cases. First, the key roles played by the pixel spacing, the size of the boxes used to partition the SAR imagery and the image texture (homogeneity) are discussed in terms of their effects on the azimuth cut-off (lambda c) estimation. Then, the reliability of the lambda c estimation is analyzed by measuring the distance between the measured and fitted autocorrelation functions (ACFs). This analysis shows that it is of paramount importance to filter unfeasible/unreliable lambda c values. To identify those values in an objective way a criterion is proposed that is based on the chi 2 test performed over a large dataset of Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. The effectiveness of the chi 2 test is verified by correlating the accepted estimates against auxiliary significant wave height data.

TI  - Surgical Management of Breast Cancer Treated with Neoadjuvant Therapy
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) allows downstaging in some cases of breast cancer. By consequence, it may enable a more conservative surgical approach or make surgery possible in cases ineligible for surgery before NAT. In this article, we review the evidence and management recommendations for optimal surgical treatment in this setting. (C) 2018 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg

AB  - This paper proposes a new approach to estimate Global Solar Radiation based on the use of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) technique combined with satellite data and a clear-sky model. Our study area is the radiometric station of Toledo, Spain. In order to train the Neural Network proposed, one complete year of hourly global solar radiation data (from the 1st of May 2013 to the 30th of April 2014) is used as the target of the experiments, and different input variables are considered: a cloud index, a clear-sky solar radiation model and several reflectivity values from Meteosat visible images. To assess the results obtained by the ELM we have selected as a reference a physical-based method which considers the relation between a clear-sky index and a cloud cover index. Then a measure of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (r(2)) is obtained to evaluate the performance of the suggested methodology against the reference model. We show the improvement of the results obtained by the ELM with respect to those obtained by the physical-based method considered.

TI  - The burden of influenza A and B in Mexico from the year 2010 to 2013: An observational, retrospective, database study, on records from the Directorate General of Epidemiology database
T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite vaccination programs, influenza still represents a significant disease burden in Mexico. We conducted an observational, retrospective analysis to better understand the epidemiological situation of the influenza virus in Mexico. Analysis of the seasonal patterns of influenza A and B were based on the Directorate General of Epidemiology dataset of influenza-like illness(ILI), and severe acute respiratory infection(SARI) that were recorded between January 2010 and December 2013. Our objectives were 1) to describe influenza A and B activity, by age group, and subtype and, 2) to analyze the number of laboratory-confirmed cases presenting with ILI by influenza type, the regional distribution of influenza, and its clinical features. Three periods of influenza activity were captured: August 2010-January 2011, December 2011-March 2012, and October 2012-March 2013. Cases were reported throughout Mexico, with 50.3% (n = 10,320) of cases found in 18-49 year olds. Over the entire capture period, a total of 76,085 ILI/SARI episodes had swab samples analyzed for influenza, 27% were positive. During the same period, influenza A cases were higher in the 18-49 years old, and influenza B cases in both 5-17 and 18-49 age groups. Peak activity occurred in January 2012 (n = 4,159) and December 2012 (n = 348) for influenza A and B respectively. This analysis confirms that influenza is an important respiratory pathogen for children and adults in Mexico despite vaccination recommendations. School-age children and adolescents were more prone to influenza B infection; while younger adults were susceptible to both influenza A and B viruses. Over the seasons, influenza A and B co-circulated.

AB  - Rice plays an important role in Italy and particularly in Piemonte Region (NW Italy). It heavily impacts on waters resources determining critical situations related to irrigation management. This work, stimulated by the Agriculture Department of Piemonte Region Administration, tries to point out the potentialities of freely available satellite data to describe both agronomic and water dynamics of rice during its phenological season. SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) measurements from Sentinel-1 mission, proved to be effective in describing water dynamics and structure variations of crop. Temporal profiles of the SAR back scattered signal (sigma degrees) were used to describe submersion phases and structural changes of crops. Differently, optical data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 missions, were jointly used to monitor crop health and water content after plants emersion. Spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, GRVI) time series were used for this purpose. Results, for the 2016 year, demonstrate that this integrated approach can well describe the main rice crop agronomic phases.

TI  - TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF LAND USE AND COVER OF RURAL SETTLEMENT FAZENDA DO SALTO - BARRA MANSA, RJ
T2  - GEO UERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural settlements are created to serve the population that needs to settle in a certain area, aiming to find an alternative for their subsistence and survival. The occupation of areas may interfere with the coverage of the soil initially established. The objective of this work was to perform the spatial-temporal analysis of land use and occupation, by means of a supervised classification, considering the period from 1999 to 2016, in Fazenda do Salto Settlement. ArcGIS 10.2.2 and Landsat7 (ETM + sensor) and Landsat 8 (OLI sensor) images were used to elaborate the land cover map and use, with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. Five classes of land cover and use were defined: Forest, Pasture, Degraded Pasture, Burned Pasture and Water. The supervised classification of the images was done through the Maximum Likelihood classifier. The Degraded Pasture class presented an increase in the history of land use and cover, related to the type of inadequate and incipient management adopted in the settlement area. The maintenance of land cover and use for the Pasture class is due to the main activity in the area of the settlement that is the cattle raising

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry is a powerful and consolidated technology to detect and monitor slow ground surface movements. However, information extraction and interpretation from big sets of InSAR deformation measurement is still a complex and demanding task. In this paper, we present a new approach for automatic analysis and detection deformations anomalous in the spatial or the temporal dimension. The method takes in input InSAR deformation measurements. In the spatial dimension, in order to reduce the dataset size, we utilize a hierarchical clustering method to obtain convergence points which are more trustful, and then to detect spatially inhomogeneous deformations. In the temporal dimension, we use a signal processing method to decompose the input into two main components: regular periodic deformations and piecewise linear deformations. After removing the periodic component, the PS velocity variation in each identified homogeneous period is analyzed to detect anomalous velocity trends and accelerations. We have tested the method on different cases, and we report the results obtained on PS measurements from high-resolution X-band COSMO-SkyMed data on some sites in China. The proposed method appears very promising, as confirmed from the in-field survey, in enabling the detection of deformation anomalies that could cause building or infrastructure stability problems, and in some cases could bring to collapses and potential disasters.

TI  - Intraoperative assessment of sentinel lymph nodes in early-stage breast cancer
T2  - ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY AND EMBRYOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The assessment of axillary lymph node (ALN) status provides heavily weighing prognostic indicators in deciding on breast carcinoma treatment. In the 6th and 7th editions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual are evaluated the nodal metastases based on size and taking into account the number of metastatic cells. According to these Manuals, a positive node is equated to metastasis whose size reaches at least 0.2 mm or amounting to more than 200 tumor cells. The clinical significance and the therapeutic optimum of the presence of a minimal nodal involvement after axillary sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) biopsy remain controversial. The need for further axillary treatment (ALN dissection or axillary radiation) in clinical N0 patients with early-stage breast carcinoma and SLNs metastases remains unclear. In all likelihood, the delivery of the regular adjuvant treatment in association with systemic treatment and radiation therapy results in survival rates similar to axillary treatment completion. This review also presents several assessment methods related to the SLNs at the surgical stage, such as cytological, histological, immunohistochemical and molecular diagnostic techniques, evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of each of them. More studies including larger groups of breast patients are needed to confirm which of them is the most reliable method for the evaluation of the SLNs.

AB  - As both possible adjuncts to institutional atmospheric chemistry remote sensing missions (e.g. Sentinel 5) and as state of the art instruments in their own right, TNO has developed an all reflective instrument design to cover UV to SWIR wavelengths. An initial breadboard development (Spectrolite) has been designed to target urban atmospheric pollution with a design for a high spatial (1x1 km(2)) at 700km altitude, and similar radiometric detection capability as current instruments. The Spectrolite instrument has been flown in an airborne campaign (Aromapex, April 2016) and, given limitations in COTS elements used, has demonstrated the performance to confirm that this design approach will achieve the expected performance for an in orbit instrument. The success of Spectrolite leads the way for other future instruments aimed at applications for land and water remote sensing.

TI  - Determining the False-Negative Rate Using Fluorescence Image-Assisted Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Despite the advances in cutaneous melanoma management, the false-negative rates (FNRs) of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) are still high. These rates are dependent not only on the technique but also on definitional terms and percentage of head/neck melanoma (highest false-negative SLNB). Fluorescence imaging technology is well acquainted in plastic surgery and other specialties. Having demonstrated that fluorescence-assisted SLNB is effective in melanoma, we are interested in determining its FNR.Methods: We obtained institutional review board approval to follow up prospectively all patients with cutaneous melanoma who underwent radioisotope/fluorescence-assisted SLNB with the intent to capture 100 negative SLNB patients. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria; (2) an SLNB report; (3) at least 24 months of follow-up in the negative SLNB group. The outcome variables were FNR and adjusted FNR of SLNB, considering the criterion standard of assessing the accuracy of SNLB. The FNR was defined as the proportion of patients with false-negative SLNB to patients with true-positive and false-negative SLNB [false negative/(false negative + true positive)]. Adjusted FNR refers to the previously described false-negative SLNB, but in the absence of local/in-transit recurrence or distant metastases. Furthermore, false-negative incidence (false-negative/negative SLNB patients) was also calculated. Length of follow-up was date of surgery to the date of last follow-up/death.Results: A total of 125 participants, with 52.0% being male and 48.0% being female, were included. One hundred patients had an SLNB negative for metastases, whereas the rest had positive SLNB results. Median follow-up time of the cohort and that of the negative SLNB group were 36.7 (2.6-58.5) and 37.9 (24.0-58.5) months, respectively. A relatively high number (24.8%) of head/neck melanoma were included. We identified 2 cases of false-negative SLNB, with one having intransit metastases. Thus, the FNR and adjusted FNR were 7.4% and 3.7%, respectively. The false-negative incidence and adjusted false-negative incidence were 2.0% and 1.0%, respectively.Conclusions: This is the first prospective study examining the FNR of fluorescence-assisted SLNB for patients with cutaneous melanoma. Our study reveals that this technique has one of the lowest FNRs published, especially considering the large percentage of participants with head/neck melanoma involved.

T2  - MESTO A DEJINY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pentapolitana was a league of the five most important royal free cities in Upper Hungary. Epigraphic monuments created to represent individuals or the urban community were important components of the extensive architecture, as well as various movable or immovable artifacts. Monumental but also simple spontaneous inscriptions often express the worldview of the community or the individual. They also point to the influences of the surrounding or remote countries from which the creators or recipients of inscriptions originated, helping modern observers to understand the cultural relationships between various regions. This article focuses on the content of medieval urban epigraphs and their urban character, discussing their contribution to our knowledge of the history of these five cities from a political and cultural point of view.

TI  - Enhanced pre-operative axillary staging using intradermal microbubbles and contrast-enhanced ultrasound to detect and biopsy sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer: a potential replacement for axillary surgery
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To compare the experience of four UK Centres in the use of intradermal microbubbles and contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to pre-operatively identify and biopsy sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in patients with breast cancer.Methods: In all centres, breast cancer patients had a microbubble/CEUS SLN core biopsy prior to axillary surgery and patients in Centres 1 and 2 had a normal greyscale axillary ultrasound. Data were collected between 2010 and 2016; 1361 from Centre 1 (prospective, sequential), 376 from Centre 2 (retrospective, sequential), 121 from Centre 3 (retrospective, selected) and 48 from Centre 4 (prospective, selected).Results: SLN were successfully core biopsied in 80% (Centre 1), 79.6% (Centre 2), 77.5% (Centre 3) and 88% (Centre 4). The sensitivities to identify all SLN metastases were 46.9% [95% confidence intervals (CI) (39.4-55.1)], 52.5% [95% CI (39.1-65.7)], 46.4% [95% CI (27.5-66.1)] and 45.5% [95% CI (16.7-76.6)], respectively. The specificities were 99.7% [95% CI (I98.9-100)], 98.1% [95% CI (94.5-99.6)], 100% [95% CI (93.2-100%)] and 96.3% [95% CI (81-99.9)], respectively. The negative predictive values were 87.0% [95% CI (84.3-89.3)], 84.5% [95% CI (78.4-89.5)], 86.9% [95% CI (82.4-90.3)] and 86.2% [95% CI (78.4-91.5)], respectively. At Centres 1 and 2, 12/730 (1.6%) and 7/181 (4%), respectively, of patients with a benign microbubble/CEUS SLN core biopsy had two or more lymph node (LN) macrometastases found at the end of primary surgical treatment.Conclusion: The identification and biopsy of SLN using CEUS is a reproducible technique.Advances in knowledge: In the era of axillary conservation, microbubble/CEUS SLN core biopsy has the potential to succeed surgical staging of the axilla.

TI  - Processing of acceleration and dive data on-board satellite relay tags to investigate diving and foraging behaviour in free-ranging marine predators
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Biologging technologies are changing the way in which the marine environment is observed and monitored. However, because device retrieval is typically required to access the high-resolution data they collect, their use is generally restricted to those animals that predictably return to land. Data abstraction and transmission techniques aim to address this, although currently these are limited in scope and do not incorporate, for example, acceleration measurements which can quantify animal behaviours and movement patterns over fine-scales. In this study, we present a new method for the collection, abstraction and transmission of accelerometer data from free-ranging marine predators via the Argos satellite system. We test run the technique on 20 juvenile southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina from the Kerguelen Islands during their first months at sea following weaning. Using retrieved archival data from nine individuals that returned to the colony, we compare and validate abstracted transmissions against outputs from established accelerometer processing procedures. Abstracted transmissions included estimates, across five segments of a dive profile, of time spent in prey catch attempt (PrCA) behaviours, swimming effort and pitch. These were then summarised and compared to archival outputs across three dive phases: descent, bottom and ascent. Correlations between the two datasets were variable but generally good (dependent on dive phase, marginal R-2 values of between .45 and .6 to>.9) and consistent between individuals. Transmitted estimates of PrCA behaviours and swimming effort were positively biased to those from archival processing. Data from this study represent some of the first remotely transmitted quantifications from accelerometers. The methods presented and analysed can be used to provide novel insight towards the behaviours and movements of free-ranging marine predators, such as juvenile southern elephant seals, from whom logger retrieval is challenging. Future applications could however benefit from some adaption, particularly to reduce positive bias in transmitted PrCA behaviours and swimming effort, for which this study provides useful insight.

TI  - Advantages of intraoperative implant for interstitial brachytherapy for accelerated partial breast irradiation either frail patients with early-stage disease or in locally recurrent breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY BRACHYTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To describe the intraoperative multicatheter implantation technique for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivered with high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT). Secondarily, to evaluate outcomes and toxicity in a series of 83 patients treated with this technique at our institution.Material and methods: Retrospective analysis of a series of patients treated with HDR-BT APBI after intraoperative multicatheter interstitial implant between November 2006 and June 2017 at our institution. We assessed cosmesis, toxicity, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS).Results: Eighty-three patients were included: 59 patients (71.1%) with primary early-stage breast cancer and 24 (28.9%) with locally recurrent breast cancer. Tumorectomy was performed in all cases, with intraoperative tumor margin assessment and sentinel node biopsy. Median age was 82 years (range, 44-92). The total prescribed dose was 32 Gy (8 treatment fractions) in 60 patients (72.3%), and 34 Gy (10 fractions) in 23 patients (27.7%). Median follow-up was 40 months (range, 1-136 months). Three-year OS and DFS in the recurrent and primary cancer groups were 87% vs. 89%, and 96 % vs. 97.8%, respectively. Five patients died from non-cancer related causes. No local relapses were observed. Rates of acute and late toxicity were low in both groups. The cosmesis was good or excellent in most of patients treated for primary disease; in patients who underwent salvage brachytherapy for local recurrence, cosmesis was good in 49 patients and fair in 6.Conclusions: This technique, although time-consuming, achieves good local disease control with a satisfactory toxicity profile in both early-stage and local recurrent breast cancer patients. It may be especially suitable for frail patients.

TI  - Wait Times for Melanoma Surgery: Is There an Association with Overall Survival?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wait times for access to care have been of increasing interest to public health care officials, health care providers, and the public. There is a paucity of data determining whether extended wait times for melanoma surgery influence patient outcomes. This study measured the association of wait times to surgical treatment with overall survival in patients with melanoma.Population-based health administrative databases were used to identify all Ontario adults diagnosed with melanoma between 2004 and 2011, time to various treatment modalities, and death dates. Proportional hazards modeling using time-dependent covariates was used to determine the adjusted association of time from melanoma diagnosis to various post-diagnostic surgical interventions with overall survival.A total of 2573 patients were included. The 5-year overall survival was 81.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 79.1-83.0]. Of all patients, 82.9% underwent a wide local excision (WLE) with a median wait time of 43 days [interquartile range (IQR) 24-64], 29.1% underwent a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) with a median wait time of 59 days (IQR 41-81), and 35.0% underwent a lymph node dissection (LND) with a median wait time of 63 days (IQR 43-91). After adjusting for age, sex, rural residence, and risk of mortality from comorbidities, wait times to WLE [hazard ratio (HR) 0.97; 95% CI 0.87-1.08; p = 0.62], SNB [HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.68-1.59; p = 0.86], and LND [HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.89-1.11; p = 0.92] were not associated with overall survival.Overall survival for patients with melanoma was not influenced by wait times to WLE, SNB, and LND.

AB  - This essay meets at the crossroads of religion and literature, insofar as it concerns the extent to which fictional characters can articulate religious viewpoints. The subject here is D. H. Lawrence's Women in Love with particular focus on the novel's main character, Rupert Birkin. This essay argues that Birkin's particular worldview, and the source of the strangeness with which it is encountered, is due to its location outside Judeo-Christian frameworks and inside a fundamentally "Gnostic" one. To prove this argument, I first adumbrate essential features of the Gnostic myth and then proceed to show how Birkin both reflects and departs from them.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Remote sensing has become an essential component of the geosciences (the study of Earth and its system components). Remote sensing measurements are almost always energies measured in selected parts of the electro-magnetic spectrum. That is, the geophysical variable of interest is only observed indirectly; a forward model relates the energies to the variable(s) of interest and other elements of the state. The first derivative of that forward model with respect to the state is known as the Jacobian. In this chapter, we review the importance of the Jacobian to inferring the state, and we use it to diagnose which state elements may be difficult to estimate. We develop the Statistical Significance Filter and flag those state elements that consistently fail to get through the filter.

AB  - This study aimed at creating a classification for complex territory of morphologically and structurally, and evaluating the correlation of classes identified with spectral information and indices determined. To analyze the classification of the territory, unsupervised method was used based on the ISODATA algorithm. From the analysis of satellite images LANDSAT 8, have resulting the dates for spectral bands R, G, B and NIR, based on which were determined NDVI, NDWI and NDBI indices, with normal distribution. Correlation analysis identified a close relationship distribution for NDVI and NDBI indices (r = 0.857; R-2 = 0.734; p<< 0.001) and for NDVI and NDWI indices as well (r = 0.991; R-2 = 0.982; p<< 0.001). Based on unsupervised analysis have resulted 7 classes, which showed a very high positive correlation with NDVI and NDWI indices.

TI  - First Record of West Nile Virus Specific Seroconversion in Dogs From Eastern Romania.
T2  - Bulletin of University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca Veterinary Medicine
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) infection causes diseases that vary in intensity from asymptomatic to fatal encephalitis in humans and animals. The etiological agent is a Flavivirus belonging to Japanesse Encephalitis complex. This zoonotic virus is maintained in nature in an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and birds as amplifying hosts. Except birds, a wide variety of animals develop seroconversion caused by infection, and previous studies indicated that dogs may be considered as sentinel for WNV. The importance of studying this virus is caused by its zoonotic character, limited possibilities of active surveillance and real-time alertness of the infection's presence in the human and animal populations. The aim of the study was to demonstrate and estimate the seroconversion in dogs within an area with confirmed cases in humans and animals. A total number of 76 serum samples were evaluated for the presence of specific anti WNV antibodies using a commercial competitive ELISA kit, for the detection of anti-pr-E antibodies (ID Screen West Nile Competition Multi-species). The results indicated specific antibodies in 32 (42.1%) out of 76 samples tested. Positive results were recorded in all four counties from which samples were collected. Our preliminary results proved the circulation of WNV in dogs in areas where the infection was previously reported in animals and humans.

AB  - Accurate identification of tropical tree species is critical for studies of forest habitat, composition, biomass, and ultimately a better understanding of the role trees play in climate variability through carbon uptake. The aim of this study was to derive an accurate classification of a tropical forest study site in Costa Rica using high-resolution imagery. A series of corrections for look and view angle, and the utilization of the DigitalGlobe atmospheric compensation procedure (AComp) provided the study with an accurate surface reflectivity dataset from WorldView-3 imagery. A rule-set object-oriented classification schema defined trees in the study area using ENVI-defined tree canopies through a segmentation of the multispectral image. The results show that select WorldView-3 bands, and WorldView-3-specific vegetation indices, can produce an accurate species-level tree classification in a complex tropical forest.

TI  - Validating the use of metre-scale multi-spectral satellite image data for identifying tropical forest tree species
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying and mapping tropical trees at the species level from space can support an improved assessment of forest composition, forest carbon uptake, tree species distribution and preferred habitat as well as a better understanding of the response of forests to climate change. In this study, the development of a validated data and image-processing schema demonstrated the capability of current metre-scale satellite technology (WorldView-3) to identify specific tree species within an unmanaged tropical forest. The experimental site, La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, provided access for field validation and spectral data acquisition of individual tree canopies from established canopy towers. It is also a representative biome of diverse lowland Atlantic tropical forests in Central America. The process defined in this paper calibrated and corrected field-acquired ASD field spectra for ten tree species and corrected WorldView-3 image data for viewing and illumination geometry. In addition, assessments of three current atmospheric compensation methods for correcting recent WorldView-3 satellite imagery established the most accurate compensation process for a tropical forest setting. Corrected reflectance in the satellite data matched the spectrometer data to +/- 0.25% for visible bands and +/- 0.5% for near-infrared bands. This study shows that spectral data from the satellite and field spectrometer data are nearly equivalent when applying the appropriate atmospheric compensation, band response emulation, and viewing correction processes established in this study.

AB  - The Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), launched in October 1978, was the first satellite-borne, visible imager developed for the purpose of investigating ocean color. The results showed that many ocean products can be generated from the remote sensing reflectance, the primary output of ocean color sensors, including chlorophyll, diffuse attenuation coefficient, particulate inorganic and organic carbon. water clarity, and sediment concentrations. Due to atmospheric absorption and scattering fewer than 10% of the photons reflected by the ocean reach space to be captured by orbiting ocean color sensors. The error budget for ocean color sensors is small and the calibration of these sensors is important for applications of the data. In order to generate useful ocean products, wavelengths around 412, 443, 488, 551, and 600 nanometers are suggested. Additional wavelengths in the shortwave infrared are required for quality atmospheric corrections.At present, the Naval Research Laboratory acquires data from five ocean color sensors. The Automated Processing System was developed to process, calibrate, and validate these sensors. Using in-situ data from the deep ocean Marine Optical Buoy and NASA's Aerosol Robotic Network of ocean color sensors at various coastal locations, the satellite data are compared and calibrated. Additionally, the data from each satellite are compared to insure that data generated are consistent. The latter allows compositing sensor data from different satellites to generate quality weekly composites. Recently acquired morning coverage provides the capability for better cloud removal and daily compositing as well as showing potential ocean feature movement over a three hour period.

TI  - Is Regression after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Different in Sentinel and Non-sentinel Nodes?
T2  - PATHOLOGY & ONCOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor draining sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are the sites of selective changes as compared to non-SLNs. They show features of tumor-reactive lymphadenopathy, including increased total number of functional blood vessels, but a relative immunosuppressed status has also been described in them. We explored the hypothesis of a selective regression or non-regression in SLNs versus non-SLNs in 142 patients with 110 estrogen receptor-positive and 32 estrogen receptor-negative tumors undergoing both SLN biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant therapy by assessing the tumoral (metastatic) and regression statuses of SLNs and non-SLNs separately. Of the 89 cases with signs of nodal regression, 22 cases (25%) were in favor of a selective non-regression in SLNs, 18 cases (20%) were supportive of a selective and more pronounced regression in the SLNs and the remaining showed equal degrees of regression or non-regression in SLNs and non-SLNs. The results indicate that there is no obvious difference in the degree of regressive histological changes shown by SLNs and NSLNs. Therefore, this phenomenon may not be a major contributor to the higher false negative rate of SLN biopsy after neoadjuvant treatment.

T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical Dry Forest deciduousness is a behavioral response to climate conditions that determines ecosystem-level carbon uptake, energy flux, and habitat conditions. It is regulated by factors related to stand age, and landscape scale variability in deciduous phenology may affect ecosystem functioning in forests throughout the tropics. This study determines whether observed phenological differences are explainable by forest age in the southern Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, where forest clearing for shifting cultivation has created a mosaic of forest stands of varying age. Matched-pair statistical tests compare neighboring forest pixels of different age class (12-22years versus 22+ years) and detect significant differences in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)-derived metrics related to the timing and intensity of deciduousness during three dry seasons (2008-2011). In all seasons, young forests exhibit significantly more intense deciduousness, measured as total seasonal change of EVI normalized by annual maximum EVI (p<0.001), and larger normalized EVI change during successive dry season months relative to start-of-dry-season EVI (p<0.001), than neighboring older forests subject to similar environmental conditions.

Basically, we adapted a dense fully convolutional net to deal with stacks of multitemporal data. The proposed approach was tested upon a public dataset comprising two Sentinel-1A sequences from a tropical region in South America. We took as baseline a dense convolutional network designed for patch classification. Thematic and spatial accuracy, as well as the computational load were evaluated experimentally. The proposed architecture matched the baseline in terms of recognition rates and proved to be very efficient computationally in the inference phase.

TI  - A satellite remote-sensing multi-index approach to discriminate pelagic <i>Sargassum</i> in the waters of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the need for quantitative information on the spatiotemporal distribution of floating macroalgae, particularly the two species of genus Sargassum, has grown because of blooms of these species in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Remote sensing is one of the most frequently used tools to assess pelagic Sargassum distribution. The purpose of this study was to implement a methodological approach to detect floating algae in an efficient and replicable manner at a moderate cost. We analyzed Landsat 8 imagery, from which we calculated four vegetation indices and one floating-algae index to implement a supervised classification, together with the bands 2 and 5, using the Random Forest algorithm. The analysis was performed monthly from 2014 to 2015 for the northeastern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, with a total of 91 analyzed images. The quantitative performance metrics of the classifier (overall, Kappa and Tau) were greater than 80%, whereas bands 2 and 5 as well as the atmospherically resistant vegetation index made the greatest contributions to the classifications. During summer 2015, more than 4,000ha of Sargassum coverage per image were observed, which was substantially greater than that over the rest of the period. This approach constitutes a transferable alternative for the systematic detection of Sargassum, which enables a quantitative semi-automated time series comparison.

AB  - This work focus on terrain deformation monitoring by means of C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1A/B imagery exploiting the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique. The deformation monitoring strategy described in this article is related to a specific monitoring scenario where a relatively small urban area is potentially affected by deformation and its surroundings are stable. In the case study considered in this work, the scenario corresponds to an area of potential subsidence induced by underground water pumping covering an area of interest with a radius of approximately 1 km. The proposed monitoring strategy takes advantage of the specific scenario at hand and, in particular, of the availability of stable areas in the vicinity of the area potentially affected by ground deformation, to estimate the Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS), i.e. signal propagation delay caused by the Earth's atmosphere, in an attempt to minimize the underestimation of the deformation rate.

AB  - A good knowledge of the quality of the satellite soil moisture products is of great importance for their application and improvement. This paper examines the performance of eight satellite-based soil moisture products, including the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) passive Level 3 (L3), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnees SMOS (CATDS) L3, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) L3, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) AMSR2 L3, the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) L3, the Chinese Fengyun-3B (FY3B) L2 soil moisture products at a coarse resolution of similar to 0.25 degrees, and the newly released SMAP enhanced passive L3 and JAXA AMSR2 L3 soil moisture products at a medium resolution of similar to 0.1 degrees. The ground soil moisture used for validation were collected from two well-calibrated and dense networks, including the Little Washita Watershed (LWW) network in the United States and the REMEDHUS network in Spain, each with different land cover. The results show that the SMAP passive soil moisture product outperformed the other products in the LWW network region, with an unbiased root mean square (ubRMSE) of 0.027 m(3) m(-3), whereas the FY3B soil moisture performed the best in the REMEDHUS network region, with an ubRMSE of 0.025 m(3) m(-3). The JAXA product performed much better at 0.25 degrees than at 0.1 degrees, but at both resolutions it underestimated soil moisture most of the time (bias < -0.05 m(3) m(-3)). The SMAP-enhanced passive soil moisture product captured the temporal variation of ground measurements well, with a correlation coefficient larger than 0.8, and was generally superior to the JAXA product. The LPRM showed much larger amplitude and temporal variation than the ground soil moisture, with a wet bias larger than 0.09 m(3) m(-3). The underestimation of surface temperature may have contributed to the general dry bias found in the SMAP (-0.018 m(3) m(-3) for LWW and 0.016 m(3) m(-3) for REMEDHUS) and SMOS (-0.004 m(3) m(-3) for LWW and -0.012 m(3) m(-3) for REMEDHUS) soil moisture products. The ESA CCI product showed satisfactory performance with acceptable error metrics (ubRMSE < 0.045 m(3) m(-3)), revealing the effectiveness of merging active and passive soil moisture products. The good performance of SMAP and FY3B demonstrates the potential in integrating them into the existing long-term ESA CCI product, in order to form a more reliable and useful product.

TI  - Protein and DNA evidences of HCMV infection in primary breast cancer tissues and metastatic sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - CANCER BIOMARKERS
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women worldwide. There are evidences that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is associated with several malignant tumors. This study aims to investigate the infection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in a large sample of breast cancer patients, and conduct a correlation analysis of clinical and pathological factors, to provide evidence for whether HCMV infection is associated with breast cancer development, progression and metastasis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 438 tissue samples (including breast cancer tissue, paracancerous tissue and sentinel lymph node [SLN] tissue) obtained from 146 patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer and intraoperatively underwent unilateral axillary SLN biopsy at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from June 2013 to June 2014 were included into this study. These tissue samples were divided into two groups: SLN positive group and SLN negative group. The clinical information is collated and numbered. Normal breast tissues of 40 patients with cyclomastopathy were taken as controls. The expressions of HCMV immediate-early (IE) and late antigen (LA) proteins of breast cancer tissues, paracancerous tissues, SLN tissues and normal breast tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and HCMV infection of the samples was graded according to the percentage of the positive cells, and HCMV IE2 mRNA expression was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The clinical data were collated and statistically analyzed.RESULTS: HCMV IE and LA proteins were highly expressed in all breast cancer tissue samples. IE proteins were detected in 47.9% (70/146) of paracancerous tissue samples, and LA proteins were detected in 53.4% (78/146) of paracancerous tissue samples. IE and LA proteins were expressed in 92.6% of metastatic SLN samples (62/68) and in most of the tumor cells. Inflammatory cells in 60% (42/70) of non-metastatic samples were positive for HCMV. HCMV DNA was present in 100% of breast cancer tissue samples, 50% of paracancerous tissue samples, and 91% of metastatic SLN samples; but this was not present in HCMV negative and non-metastatic SLN samples. Differences in HCMV infection, and estrogen receptor-alpha, progesterone receptor, Elston classification, Ki67 percentage, Her-2 and Luminal type and other clinical indicators were not statistically significant.CONCLUSION: HCMV infection is common in breast cancer tissues, paracancerous tissues and SLN tissues. The severity of HCMV infection varied markedly with tissue type. HCMV infection might be associated with metastasis and invasion of breast cancer. The expression of HCMV IE2 was associated to breast cancer and lymph node metastasis. The expression level of estrogen receptor-alpha was related to HCMV infection.

AB  - It has been a hot study field to extract forest structure parameter using Airborne LiDAR. Since footprints of Airborne LiDAR data are discontinuously distributed with small data coverage, therefore, it is impossible to obtain the forest structure information of continuous region using Airborne LiDAR data alone. The MODIS BRDF shape indicators contain the information regarding 3-D structure of forest and have the possibility to retrieve the structural parameters of forest. In this study, we select Howland Forest, Harvard Forest, La Selva Forest and Bartlett Forest as experimental areas, and aim to construct a canopy height estimation model from the airborne Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) data and MODIS BRDF shape indicators. Firstly, H100 canopy height was extracted from the LVIS data and the MODIS BRDF shape indicators were calculated based on MODIS data. Secondly, using the Random Forest algorithm to develop a canopy height estimation model with H100 canopy height data and MODIS BRDF shape indicators. Finally, 10-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model, and the validation results show that the MODIS BRDF shape indicators can be estimated forest canopy heights in high accuracy.

TI  - Application of a Hybrid Model Based on a Convolutional Auto-Encoder and Convolutional Neural Network in Object-Oriented Remote Sensing Classification
T2  - ALGORITHMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Variation in the format and classification requirements for remote sensing data makes establishing a standard remote sensing sample dataset difficult. As a result, few remote sensing deep neural network models have been widely accepted. We propose a hybrid deep neural network model based on a convolutional auto-encoder and a complementary convolutional neural network to solve this problem. The convolutional auto-encoder supports feature extraction and data dimension reduction of remote sensing data. The extracted features are input into the convolutional neural network and subsequently classified. Experimental results show that in the proposed model, the classification accuracy increases from 0.916 to 0.944, compared to a traditional convolutional neural network model; furthermore, the number of training runs is reduced from 40,000 to 22,000, and the number of labelled samples can be reduced by more than half, all while ensuring a classification accuracy of no less than 0.9, which suggests the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model.

AB  - Taking the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi Province as the research area, based on the MODE NDVI data after time series reconstruction, combined with the land-use status data,DEM data, and forest resources survey results, the change vector analysis method and overlay segmentation method were used to analyze the degree of change in land cover and the type of change were explored in the Qinling Mountains from 2000 to 2015. The results showed that: 1)The most significant change of the land use map unit in the Qinling Mountains in 2000-2015 was the "dedduous forest to mingled forest", "cultivated land to deciduous forest" is the second largest unit type, accounting for 46.32% and 12.74% of the changeable area respectively. The other land use types have the smallest change to the water body, accounting for less than 0.01% of the area. 2) According to the NDVI cumulative change rate and the segmentation threshold, the NDVI change vector intensity types are determined: increasing, fluctuating, decreasing and stable. The area of increasing type accounted for 35.53%, and distributed around Shangluo in the northeast of the study area, Ankang in the southwest of Hanzhong and the south of the city mainly. The fluctuating type and decreasing area accounted for 5.46% and 0.85 4 respectively. The fluctuating type was mixed among other types of changes, and the decreasing type were mainly distributed along the gentle slopes along the Luo River, Han River and Danjiang River, and around the city. The stable type has a dominant position and is distributed over a large area outside the areas of increasing, decreasing, and fluctuating, with an area ratio of 58.16% In the areas with an altitude elevation of less than 1000m in the Qinling Mountains, the NDVI change vector increase dominates. With the increase of altitude, the NDVI change vector type within the range of 1500-2700m altitude is dominated by the stable type, and the proportion of the increasing type is reduced by the altitude; In the areas with a high altitude of 2700m, the NDVI change slowly increases year by year, showing an increase in the proportion of increased pixel area. Based on the dynamic analysis of vegetation cover change intensity in mountainous regions of Qinling Mountains, this paper reveals the intensity and regularity of vegetation changes in mountainous regions, provideing a basis for rapid monitoring of large-scale land cover changes, and has practical significance for the ecological protection of the Qinling Mountains.

TI  - Three-Axis Magnetometer Calibration based on Optimal Ellipsoidal Fitting under Constraint Condition for Pedestrian Positioning System Using Foot-mounted Inertial Sensor/Magnetometer

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Indoor pedestrian positioning is a technology for indoor pedestrian to provide position information. Global Positioning System (GPS) is the most widely used positioning system in the world at present, the accuracy of GPS in the indoor environment cannot meet the requirements because the GPS signal is extremely attenuated by the architectural shelter. Hence, the indoor positioning system without GPS has become a hot spot for research. The inertial sensor is an autonomous navigation and positioning sensor, which does not rely on external information, the position information of indoor pedestrian can be obtained by calculating the data collected from inertial sensor (accelerometer and gyroscope). It is an effective method to illustrate inertial device on the foot of pedestrian, which is called a pedestrian positioning system based on foot-mounted inertial sensors. Due to the accumulative error increased with time, the positioning system based on inertial sensors cannot provide accurate position information alone during a long time. Hence, the Zero Update (ZUPT) algorithm is proposed to effectively limit the accumulative error of inertial sensor. However, the heading error is unobservable when the velocity is used as the observation, which further limits the positioning accuracy of the indoor pedestrian positioning system based on foot-mounted inertial sensor. The heading information calculated by the output from magnetometer can be an effective observation to assist the foot-mounted inertial sensor. However, magnetometer is susceptible to environmental interference magnetic field, which can reduce the accuracy of the heading information obtained from magnetometer. Hence, the magnetometer calibration is the key to improve the accuracy of observation and achieve high precision indoor pedestrian positioning based on foot-mounted inertial sensor/magnetometer. Three-axis magnetometer interference can be effective suppressed by optimal ellipsoidal fitting based on least square, the algebraic distance equation between measured value and fitted ellipsoid is establish, all magnetometer error parameters can be obtained by calculating the equation. However, the deviation of the measured value from the theoretical value reduce the rank the calculated matrix, many results are obtained rather than the optimal result. To solve this problem, three-axis magnetometer calibration based on optimal ellipsoidal fitting under constrained conditions is proposed. The magnetic interference model is established at first, which can be described by ellipsoid model, then establish the algebraic distance equation between measured value and fitted ellipsoid, the constraint condition can be obtained by constraining the three-dimensional surface to an ellipsoid.The optimal ellipsoidal fitting under the constraint condition is used to calculate magnetometer parameters and compensate the magnetic interference to improve the accuracy of the heading information obtained from magnetometer. The MTi-G710 (integrated accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, barometer, GPS receiver and Beidou receiver) produced by Xsens company is adopted to complete the actual test, which includes Offline turntable test and indoor pedestrian positioning test based on foot-mounted inertial sensor/magnetometer. The ellipsoid fitting effect based on the proposed magnetometer calibration algorithm is obtained in the offline turntable test. In the indoor pedestrian positioning test based on foot-mounted inertial sensor/magnetometer, the pedestrian movement system model and observation model are established, the result of pedestrian is obtained by the data fusion based on foot-mounted inertial sensor/magnetometer, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are verified.

AB  - In sub-Saharan Africa, little is known about the epidemiology of pandemic-prone influenza viruses in urban settings. Using data from a prospective sentinel surveillance network, we characterized the emergence, epidemiology, and transmission dynamics of 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 influenza (H1N1pdm09) in Kampala, Uganda. After virus introduction via international air travel from England in June 2009, we estimated the basic reproductive number in Kampala to be 1.06-1.13, corresponding to attack rates of 12-22%. We subsequently identified 613 cases of influenza in Kampala from 2009 to 2015, of which 191 (31.2%) were infected with H1N1pdm09. Patients infected with H1N1pdm09 were more likely to be older adult (ages 35-64) males with illness onset during rainy season months. Urban settings in sub-Saharan Africa are vulnerable to importation and intense transmission of pandemic-prone influenza viruses. Enhanced surveillance and influenza pandemic preparedness in these settings is needed.

AB  - Each of the many ethnic groups in Myanmar has its own unique worldview; however, these are all principally related, in some respects, to the three primary worldviews in Myanmar, as informed by the culture historically: animism, Buddhism, and, to a lesser extent, Hinduism.For the purposes of this article, I am defining "worldview" as:A culturally-informed, yet personal, system of thought, wherein are held existential beliefs, such as regards the existence or non-existence of a god or gods; evaluative beliefs, such as regards proper and improper expressions of social intercourse; and prescriptive beliefs, such as regards value and purpose.In light of this definition, the worldviews in Myanmar will be explored as to their existential, evaluative, and prescriptive beliefs, with a summary statement, addressing the missiological challenges, which those worldviews present, in particular, to Christian unity.

TI  - Is a clean river fun for all? Recognizing social vulnerability in watershed planning
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Watershed planning can lead to policy innovation and action toward environmental protection. However, groups often suffer from low engagement with communities that experience disparate impacts from flooding and water pollution. This can limit the capacity of watershed efforts to dismantle pernicious forms of social inequality. As a result, the benefits of environmental changes often flow to more empowered residents, short-changing the power of watershed-based planning as a tool to transform ecological, economic, and social relationships. The objectives of this paper are to assess whether the worldview of watershed planning actors are sufficiently attuned to local patterns of social vulnerability and whether locally significant patterns of social vulnerability can be adequately differentiated using conventional data sources. Drawing from 35 in-depth interviews with watershed planners and community stakeholders in the Milwaukee River Basin (WI, USA), we identify five unique definitions of social vulnerability. Watershed planners in our sample articulate a narrower range of social vulnerability definitions than other participants. All five definitions emphasize spatial and demographic characteristics consistent with existing ways of measuring social vulnerability. However, existing measures do not adequately differentiate among the spatio-temporal dynamics used to distinguish definitions. In response, we develop two new social vulnerability measures. The combination of interviews and demographic analyses in this study provides an assessment technique that can help watershed planners (a) understand the limits of their own conceptualization of social vulnerability and (b) acknowledge the importance of place-based vulnerabilities that may otherwise be obscured. We conclude by discussing how our methods can be a useful tool for identifying opportunities to disrupt social vulnerability in a watershed by evaluating how issue frames, outreach messages, and engagement tactics. The approach allows watershed planners to shift their own culture in order to consider socially vulnerable populations comprehensively. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Directional reflectance studies in support of the Radiometric Calibration Test Site (RadCaTS) at Railroad Valley
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The Radiometric Calibration Test Site (RadCaTS) is a suite of commercial and custom instruments used to make measurements of the surface reflectance and atmosphere throughout the day at Railroad Valley, Nevada. It was developed in response to the need for daily radiometric calibration data for the vast array of Earth-observing sensors on orbit, which is continuously increasing as more nations and private companies launch individual environmental satellites as well as large constellations. The current suite of instruments at RadCaTS includes five ground-viewing radiometers (GVRs), four of which view the surface in a nadir-viewing configuration. Many sensors such as those on Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 view Railroad Valley within 3 of nadir, while others such as those on Sentinel-2A and-2B, RapidEye, Aqua, Suomi NPP, and Terra can view Railroad Valley at off-nadir angles. Past efforts have shown that the surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) has minimal impact on vicarious calibration uncertainties for views <10, but the desire to use larger view angles has prompted the effort to develop a BRDF correction for data from RadCaTS. The current work investigates the application of Railroad Valley BRDF data derived from a BRF camera developed at the University of Arizona in the 1990s (but is no longer in use) to the current RadCaTS surface reflectance measurements. Also investigated are early results from directional reflectance studies using a mobile spectro-goniometer system during a round-robin field campaign in 2018. This work describes the preliminary results, the effects on current measurements, and the approach for future measurements.

AB  - The Radiometric Calibration Test Site (RadCaTS) is a suite of ground-based instruments operating at Railroad Valley, Nevada, USA. Surface reflectance and atmospheric data are collected throughout the day so that top-of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance and reflectance can be provided to satellite sensor operators. Its development arose from the need to accumulate data in the absence of ground personnel, which has become even more essential with the recent launches of very large satellite constellations. RadCaTS has been used to monitor and validate the radiometric calibration of sensors ranging from multispectral to hyperspectral, with spatial resolutions ranging from similar to 1-1000 m. The work presented here provides a description of the system as well as examples of current RadCaTS results for the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Sentinel-2A and -2B Multispectral Instrument (MSI).

AB  - The GOES-16 satellite was launched on 19 Nov 2016, and it became operational as the GOES-East satellite on 18 Dec 2017. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is one of six instruments onboard GOES-16. It has 16 spectral bands, a spatial resolution of 0.5-2.0 km, and five times the temporal coverage of the previous GOES Imager. ABI has onboard radiometric calibration capabilities that were not available on the previous Imager instrument. The Radiometric Calibration Test Site (RadCaTS) is an automated facility composed of ground-based instruments that measure the surface reflectance and atmosphere throughout the day. It was developed by the Remote Sensing Group (RSG) of the College of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona, and it is currently used to monitor such low-Earth orbit (LEO) sensors as Landsat-8 OLI, Terra and Aqua MODIS, Sentinel-2A and -2B MSI, SNPP VIIRS, and others. The successful launch of GOES-16, coupled with the improved spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics of ABI, provide a unique opportunity to intercompare results obtained from a geosynchronous sensor to those obtained from typical LEO sensors. This work describes the recent efforts of RSG to validate the radiometric calibration of ABI, and compare the results with LEO sensors using RadCaTS.

TI  - Clear cell sarcoma
T2  - ONCOLOGY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Clear cell sarcoma (CCS), also referred as to melanoma of soft tissues, is a rare malignant tumour of soft tissues. This tumour harbors the characteristic features of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and is a slowly growing, painless tumour, which then acquires an aggressive course. CCS is characterized by a translocation t(12; 22)(q13; q12), which in addition to the diagnostic implications may be important for targeted treatment in the future. CCS occurs mainly on the limbs, most often shin (in feet and ankle area) in the tendons and aponeurosis, often at a young age. CCS is characterized by high potential to develop metastases in regional lymph nodes (about 30% of cases). In the diagnostic process one should consider performing a sentinel node biopsy with possible subsequent radical lymphadenectomy in the case of metastases detection. Treatment of localized disease is limited to radical local excision with complementary radiotherapy. Due to the resistance to classical chemotherapy and the presence of characteristic molecular abnormalities, trials of molecular targeted therapies in this group of cancers are ongoing. In clinical trials, MET inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) - sunitinib and pazopanib were evaluated. CCS was also one of the subtypes of tumours evaluated in the CREATE clinical trial with crizotinib.

AB  - We present first full-resolution and large area Sentinel-1 multi-temporal InSAR analysis of the Tatra Mts. region within Slovakia as a case study on a feasibility of processing chain based on the Sentinels Application Platform (SNAP) and Stanford method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS). We utilize all Sentinel-1 data from three individual orbits, acquired from the beginning of the mission until the end of 2017. Study area was chosen to test the performance of our system over mountainous and sparsely urbanized land characteristic for strong atmospheric perturbations. Our results reveal several distinct areas of small-scale deformation phenomena, e.g. rockslides or land subsidence. InSAR displacement time series are validated via GNSS observations at the points of Slovakian permanent reference network. We conclude with the potential of proposed workflow for the future Slovakian nationwide multi-temporal InSAR processing. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

M3  - Article
AB  - Building on the availability of high revisit frequency Earth Observation satellites at medium spatial resolution (250m), this study investigates the feasibility of temporal monitoring of water bodies at a continental scale with MODIS. A 2004-2010 time series of twice-daily observations covering the whole African continent was systematically processed using a surface water detection method to derive 10-day indicators describing the location, the intra- and inter-annual variability as well as the temporal characterization of water bodies (i.e. seasonal or permanent water and maximum extent). The multispectral surface reflectance transformation in the HSV color space allows a per-pixel identification of surface water. The water aggregation time indicator provides the water occurrence for each 10-day period built from the seven years of observations. The cartographic products were successfully cross-validated with already existing maps and water products. The validation of the water body maximum extent map estimates the commission error at less than 6% and the seasonality information was also found to be consistent with the Koppen climatic classification.

TI  - The Backwater Clam (<i>Meretrix casta</i>) as a bioindicator species for monitoring the pollution of an estuarine environment by genotoxic agents
T2  - MUTATION RESEARCH-GENETIC TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MUTAGENESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The coast of Goa receives anthropogenic stress through its major rivers, which carry mining wastes, including iron and manganese ores from upstream mining sites, and petroleum hydrocarbons from shipping activities. These contaminants show seasonal variation in concentration and may be bioaccumulated by fauna inhabiting these waters. These fauna, including the bivalve molluscs, are particularly at risk due to these insults. In the present study, the use of the bacicwater clam, Meretrix casta (Chemnitz), as a bioindicator species was evaluated, comparing two sites (Vasco and Palolem) on the Goan coast. DNA damage was assessed in the gill cells using the micronucleus and comet assays; physiological condition was determined from the condition index. These values were tested for correlations with the concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons and trace metals in the whole soft tissues and with the physico-chemical parameters of water from these sites. Specimens collected from Vasco showed high incidence of micronuclei and % tail DNA and a low condition index ratio compared to those from Palolem, which correlates with the higher level of pollutants in the bivalves the former site. We believe that M. costa is a suitable species for biomonitoring studies of this type.

TI  - Satellite-based ET estimation using Landsat 8 images and SEBAL model
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - ABSTRACT Estimation of evapotranspiration is a key factor to achieve sustainable water management in irrigated agriculture because it represents water use of crops. Satellite-based estimations provide advantages compared to direct methods as lysimeters especially when the objective is to calculate evapotranspiration at a regional scale. The present study aimed to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ET) at a regional scale, using Landsat 8 - OLI/TIRS images and complementary data collected from a weather station. SEBAL model was used in South-West Parana, region composed of irrigated and dry agricultural areas, native vegetation and urban areas. Five Landsat 8 images, row 223 and path 78, DOY 336/2013, 19/2014, 35/2014, 131/2014 and 195/2014 were used, from which ET at daily scale was estimated as a residual of the surface energy balance to produce ET maps. The steps for obtain ET using SEBAL include radiometric calibration, calculation of the reflectance, surface albedo, vegetation indexes (NDVI, SAVI and LAI) and emissivity. These parameters were obtained based on the reflective bands of the orbital sensor with temperature surface estimated from thermal band. The estimated ET values in agricultural areas, native vegetation and urban areas using SEBAL algorithm were compatible with those shown in the literature and ET errors between the ET estimates from SEBAL model and Penman Monteith FAO 56 equation were less than or equal to 1.00 mm day-1.

T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil there are six well-defined biomes and the Caatinga represents 9.92% of the total area. This biome is exclusively Brazilian and very rich in biodiversity. Because it has low resistance to human interference is necessary to know the important factors in monitoring the biome. Vegetation coverage and climate are two of these factors, as they indicate the intensity of human activity and the wear caused with time. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been recently explored in the description of tree phenology. In this study we sought to associate NDVI/Landsat values to a climatic variable (phenomena El-Nino and La-Nina - NINONINA) in order to describe the phenological behavior of the Caatinga in the Parque Nacional da Serra das Capivaras in the state of Piaui/Brazil. A time series analysis was carried out, describing the intrinsic parameters of the series (Seasonality and Trends), the forecast of NDVI values using SARIMA model and co-integration between NDVI and NINONINA series. The results showed that the NDVI series presents seasonally, but does not exhibit a trend. The forecasting process presenting relatively low error at a 95% confidence interval. Finally, it was observed that the NDVI series is co-integrated with the NINONINA series.

AB  - An aim of this paper was to assess the accuracy in estimating soybean yield proposed by Doorenbos and Kassam over a region in Brazil using the evapotranspiration fraction (EF) obtained from a simplified version of the triangle model, the counties analyzed were Toledo, Vera Cruz do Oeste, Cascavel, Campo Bonito, Medianeira and Serranopolis Iguacu, in Parana state, for crop years 2002/03 to 2011/12. A high accuracy of the data was found, the model values for the parameter d1 ("d1" modified Willmott) were between 0.8 and 0.95 in most counties, whereas the root mean squared error showed that there was low variation between 149,60 to 358,60 (kg ha(-1)). This means that the average of the data from the modified model (using the remotely determined evapotranspiration fraction) were statistically equal the average of the measured soybean crop data. The remote sensing input can be used as tools in the absence of surface information, serving as input data for assisting in agrometeorological modeling in order to estimate agricultural productivity of soybean.

AB  - Earthen levees protect large areas of populated and cultivated land in the United States. Unstable slope conditions can lead to slump slides, which weaken the levees and increase the likelihood of failure during floods. Such slides could lead to further erosion and through seepage during high water events. Currently, levee inspections are performed infrequently and some of the problem areas are not visible. There is a need to develop cost-effective large-scale methods of screening levees in a timely manner. Sensing the condition of levees remotely can help levee managers to focus and prioritize their inspection and maintenance activities. This paper presents results of applying the TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture radar data to detect vulnerabilities on Francis, Mississippi river levees. In this study, texture features were computed using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and both supervised and unsupervised classifiers were tested. The supervised method tested is the SVM (support vector machine), and the unsupervised one is the RXD (Reed-Xiaoli Detector). Both algorithms achieved high accuracy detection of potential slump slides in the test area.

AB  - Operational detection and discrimination of oil spills over oceans has received considerable attention due to its impact on marine ecosystem from environmental and political points of view. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a valuable instrument for maritime pollution monitoring. The three main requirements for effective operational oil spill detection using SAR are: 1) low noise floor, 2) large area coverage, and 3) maximizing detection and discrimination of pollution and 'lookalike' features, by polarization diversity, multiple frequency, etc. In order to reconcile the advantages of fully polarimetric SAR with larger area coverage, compact polarimetry (CP) acquisitions offer a trade-off between the above mentioned requirements. The future Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) will enable the acquisition of CP SAR data in wide swath imagery, including ScanSAR modes. In this study, we investigate the potential of CP from three RCM SAR modes for oil spill detection. Results indicate that the RCM MR30 SAR mode has promising oil spill detection performance.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing has become a valuable tool for sea ice characterization. Operational sea ice monitoring usually relies on SAR data from single-or dual-polarized beam modes such as the ScanSAR mode of RADARSAT-2. However, such imagery cannot accurately discriminate certain sea ice types and open water states at all times during the year. Thus, the recently proposed compact polarimetric (CP) SAR configuration for Earth observation could be a compromised choice for operational sea ice observation. This configuration will be included in the future RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM). In this study, simulated CP SAR data of the RCM High Resolution (HR) SAR mode is evaluated for sea ice classification. Results indicate promising performance of the RCM HR mode for First Year Ice (FYI) and Multiyear Ice (MYI) classification using CP SAR data.

The aim of the project was to examine the applicability of vegetation parameters calculated from Sentinel2 and PROBA-V satellite data for crop yield prognosis. The extensive field measurements have been carried out parallel to Sentinel-2 and Proba-V satellite overpasses in order to elaborate the best relationship between satellite data and in-situ measured LAI. Finally the prognosis model based on meteorological data with the periodical input of LAI for wheat yield prognosis has been applied. Additionally classification of crops over JECAM site in Wielkopolska district was performed for 2016 and 2017 to choose the fields with wheat and with other crops for further research.

AB  - Urban land use dynamics is an important component for land use management and regional planning of the area. In this paper an attempt is made to analyze the processes of spatial and temporal change pattern in Kota City of Rajasthan, which is undergoing a fast but unplanned development. Satellite-derived urban land use maps of 1999, 2011, and 2016 and Markov model coupled with geospatial technology have been adopted to predict the spatial distribution of land use change in future. Transition among different land use types is analyzed to understand the spatial as well as temporal variability during a period of 1999-2016. Markov model performance was evaluated between the empirical urban land use map extracted from Landsat 8 (multispectral merged panchromatic) image and the simulated land use map obtained from the Markov model. Later spatial pattern changing characteristics were investigated by predicting the land use/cover changes up to 2030. Result implies the rising trend in built-up areas especially in periphery of the city with decreasing trend in agriculture land. This study suggests that this spatio-temporal model provides not only a quantitative description of changes in the past but also the estimated direction and magnitude of likely changes in the future. Hence, if the current trends exist without sustainable development measures, severe land degradation will occur that could indirectly affect the local environment of the city. Therefore, this study is helpful for local authorities to understand the complex land use system and develop guidelines as well as policies for sustainable urban expansion and ecological conservation.

Experimental dataset in the measurements of thickness and snow water equivalent consisted of two datasets from ALOS-2 PALSAR observations made in snow free conditions and in the presence of snow cover. Theoretical relations between interferometric phase difference, snow layer thickness and snow water equivalent for a given observation geometry and radar signal wavelength are presented. An essential feature of the experiment was the deployment at the test field of the reference corner reflector having stable level of radar cross section and scattered signal phase center location. Its interferometric phase difference was used as reference in calculations of the phase differences induced by snow cover on the test field. The calculations of snow depth made using theoretical relations, interferometric phase difference measurements, as well as direct measurements of snow layer thickness at the test field are in good agreement.

AB  - The passive remote sensing of Landsat images gives a great opportunity to look at the glaciers and the glacial lakes in the Himalayas and construct a time series to assess the changes which has occurred over the years. After analyzing different methods to map clean glaciers, debris covered glaciers and glacial lakes, a method combining supervised classification of the Landsat image and morphometric parameters (slope and aspect) derived from global digital elevation model (ASTER GDEM) was applied to map the glaciers and glacial lakes in the northeastern Himalayas of Nepal and bordering areas of Tibetan plateau. Furthermore, manual intervention was also done for the debris covered glaciers and glacial lakes to reduce the noises and improve the accuracy. A time series was constructed after mapping which included the years1992,1995,1998,2008 and 2015 with 1992 as the reference year. An apparent melting trend for the clean glaciers was seen with coefficient of regression of 0.56 and a loss rate of -10.54 km(2) per year for the period of 23 years (1992-2015). For the debris covered glaciers and glacial lakes, a fluctuating behavior with no trend was seen. However, a clear trend of expansion of the supraglacial lakes on top of the debris covered glaciers was seen with the regression coefficient of more than 0.9 and a rate of expansion of 0.11 km(2) per year. A total of 6 lakes in the study area were seen to be expanding significantly since 1992. Although glaciers and glacial lakes could be mapped with satisfactory results, the results could be improved by using high resolution imagery in combination with Landsat. Moreover, using radar based remote sensing to map the glaciers and glacial lakes in the Himalayas could mitigate the problem of cloud cover which was one of the major hindrances in this study.

AB  - Satellite Remote Sensing (RS) can be effectively used for the fisheries applications, including stock assessment, management of marine resources and fish harvesting. Further, there is an extensive range of fisheries related applications of RS data, including identifying marine managed areas, detection of harmful algal blooms, bycatch reduction, long term monitoring of fisheries related habitat changes and control of illegal fishing. Applications on RS related to marine fisheries sector in Sri Lanka, seem to be meager. Limited studies have been conducted on the fisheries related ecosystem damage assessment using RS after December 2004 Tsunami disaster. To fulfill the gaps of research on coastal fisheries identified, the author conducted some research on habitat changes such as monitoring of land use changes and water quality at economically important estuarine environments around Sri Lanka using multi temporal satellite imageries. In these studies, several environmental issues have been addressed such as localized eutrophication, disturbance of water circulations and sudden fish kills etc. Furthermore, since satellite RS is a useful tool that could be applied for planning marine fisheries development in Sri Lanka, the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) is currently conducting forecasting of fishing ground using satellite data for offshore/ high seas fishery, providing accurate information on large pelagic fishing grounds considering sea surface temperature and chlorophyll distribution. As illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing is a serious threat to the long-term economic and environmental sustainability of Sri Lankan oceans, RS techniques exhibit great potential for supporting to develop fisheries monitoring system around Sri Lankan waters which is timely important for control IUU fishing. VIIRS Boat Detection system of NOAA and Global Fishing Watch were discussed as the possible systems that can support the future monitoring and management of Sri Lankan marine fisheries sector. This paper summarizes the present RS related applications to the marine fishery sector of Sri Lanka. Further, it also provides guidelines for sustainable management of the sector that can result from RS, and identify existing applications which can effectively support the marine fishery management of the country.

TI  - Spectral-radiometric differentiation of non-photosynthetic vegetation and soil within Landsat and Sentinel 2 wavebands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We explore the comprehensive differentiation of non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and soil using Landsat and Sentinel 2 wavebands through a spectral library approach. NPV and soil spectra from online spectral libraries and an Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) scene were convolved to Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Sentinel 2 bands. Several spectral-radiometric measurements, including the spectral reflectance of analogous Landsat and Sentinel bands, and a suite of spectral indices were tested for the separation of NPV and soil. Reflectance of individual bands is similar between the two categories, and vegetation indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) are incapable of such differentiation. For both reference and image spectra, the normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) based on the two shortwave infrared bands of Landsat and Sentinel instruments performed best among all spectral measurements. Classification results suggest an NDTI value of 0.1 to be a general threshold for separating NPV and soil, with higher values associated with NPV. Further tests based on AVIRIS-convolved imagery show that NDTI can dichotomize NPV and soil if either fractional cover is no less than 50%.

T2  - RESOURCE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bangonghu-Nujiang metallogenic belt is considered to be Tibet's third copper belt after the Yulong and Gangdese copper belts. The Duolong gold-rich porphyry copper deposit, located in the western part of the Bangonghu-Nujiang belt was recently recognized as a superlarge prospect. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) was used to characterize the Duolong porphyry deposit alteration area, and three methods, color enhancement, band ratio transformation, and spectral angle mapping, were utilized to extract the phyllic and argillic alteration zones, which are typically considered the most important predictors of porphyry copper. Seven prospecting areas, which match mapped alteration zones, were delineated in the Duolong deposit. In addition, an ASTER image of the eastern region of the Bangonghu-Nujiang belt in the Xiongmei area was used to extract alteration information, and an area with image characteristics similar to the Duobuza and Bolong ore deposits was identified as a prospecting area. Numerous malachite outcrops were identified in the field, and both laboratory analysis and isotopic dating confirmed that the deposit had formed concurrently with the Duobuza deposit (119 Ma). Geologic mapping at the 1: 5000 scale was conducted in the area, and three types of ore-bearing rocks were identified, indicating that this area has significant potential to host ore deposits. The discovery of the Xiongmei copper mining area is significant for the Bangonghu-Nujiang belt.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - In this paper, a novel spatiotemporal fusion model based on deep learning is proposed, which handles the huge spatial resolution gap and the nonlinear mapping between the high spatial resolution (HSR) image and the corresponding high temporal resolution (HTR) image at the same imaging time. Considering the huge spatial resolution gap, a two-layer fusion strategy is adopted. In each layer, the convolutional neural network (CNN) model is employed to exploit the non-linear mapping between the HSR and HTR image and reconstruct the high-spatial and high-temporal (HSHT) resolution images. In the experiment, Landsat data is the representation of the high spatial resolution images, MODIS data is used as the corresponding low spatial resolution images. The experimental results on two different datasets clearly illustrate the superiority of the proposed model.

TI  - Effects of Climate and Land Cover Changes on Habitat for Herbivores at Mole National Park, Ghana.
T2  - West African Journal of Applied Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine climate and land cover changes in the MNP and the effect these could have on the large herbivores. Monthly temperature and rainfall data and Landsat satellite imagery from 1980 to 2013 for the Mole National Park (MNP) were acquired. Land cover classes of the imageries were validated through ground truth accuracy assessment procedure. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to model the data using time series statistics with R. The results indicated a rise in temperature that became significant after two decades and a reduction in the amount of rainfall every decade. The decade mean temperature for the period 2000-2010 (2000s) reached the highest of 27.2 [plus or minus] 0.15 [degree]C while the 1980s recorded the least of 26.7 [plus or minus] 0.25 [degree]C. The decade mean rainfall for the 1980s reached the highest of 129 [plus or minus] 9.91 mm while the least of 93.9 [plus or minus] 7.41 mm was recorded in the 2000s. There was a strong and significant negative correlation between the mean rainfall time series and the mean temperature time series for the period under review. The shrub-land occupied the largest part of the Park (about 26%) followed by the open savanna (23%) Rainfall influenced the open savanna, grass and shrub classes immediately, but the closed savanna lagged behind rainfall by five years. As forecast suggested a relatively high temperature and low rainfall, the shrub-land and grassland are likely to shrink while open and closed savanna woodland areas expand by 2020. Accordingly, there may be shrinking forage resources for the grazers and abundant forage for the browsers during the period. It is recommended to reduce the extent of burning at MNP during the forecast period to make forage sufficiently available for grazing. Regular follow up to this study could provide a guideline to securing habitats, and forage, for MNP's herbivores.

T2  - ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH 2018
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th International Conference on Forest Fire Research
CL  - Coimbra, PORTUGAL
AB  - Burned area mapping is a fundamental activity for the study of wildfires, but good quality data requires long in situ campaigns performed by specialized personnel. The use of machine learning algorithms and the availability of high-quality remote sensing data bring new opportunities to make the process more precise and expedite. This paper elicits the best combinations of features to be used in machine learning pixel-based burned area mapping, obtained by LASSO regression. The feature selection is applied to ground-truth obtained in the region of Castelo de Paiva, Portugal, in 2016.The selected number of features is 9, from an initial set of 51 features, and includes besides a new index a mix of prefire, postfire as well delta differences of spectral indices (namely dNBR). The selected features can be used with Sentinel 2, Landsat, and MODIS imagery.In parallel, the identified features have been fed to several classifiers, namely a multilayer neural network, gradient boost and extreme gradient boosting, support vector machines and K-nearest neighbour classifiers to validate the choice performed by the LASSO regression. Accuracies of 96% and kappa of 0.86, are consistently obtained for Sentinel 2 imagery, and Landsat 8 also scores very well; as expected, MODIS results in score reduction to the coarser spatial resolution. Confusion maps are presented to visualise the quality of the obtained results, as well as to pinpoint existing problems with the ground-truth.Extreme Gradient Boosting shows to combine very high classification metrics with very efficient processing, possible via the Graphics Processing Units (GPU) implementation of XGBoost. A simple processing architecture is proposed to support an automatic classification system based on the publicly available satellite imagery, supported by the benchmarks obtained in this paper. A set of Sentinel 2 granules covering Portugal can be processed in less than 10 minutes in consumer hardware, for each satellite passage.

AB  - Urban environmental management is of profound importance due to increasing urban development alongside the need to develop resilient cities and sustainable urbanization strategies. Spatial explicit urban environmental quality indices can provide policy makers and the public with valuable information for urban planning and policy formation. The aim of this study is the development of a multi-component urban environmental quality index for the metropolitan area of Thessaloniki. The approach was designed to be robust and easily transferred across cities with similar characteristics. Land Surface Temperature (LST) was estimated based on multi-seasonal Landsat-8 images, while Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) was derived from fused Sentinel-2 images and validated using WorldView-2 very high spatial resolution imagery. In addition, several geospatial layers related to atmospheric pollution, petroleum refineries, noise pollution, urban density and distance to green infrastructures were processed within GIS environment and integrated with the satellite extracted information. A multi-criteria Analytical Hierarchical Approach (AHP) was used for integrating the sub-criteria to a final urban environmental quality index using weights from expert knowledge and literature review. The results identified extended areas in the western part of the study region as well as several hot spots in the eastern part, that local planners should develop and implement actions for improving living conditions of residents. Overall, the method proved to be viable and flexible and its application can be expanded to similar Mediterranean cities.

AB  - The failure of flood-control infrastructure, such as levees, due to a natural or manmade hazard can have significant repercussions, sometimes with dramatic and unanticipated consequences on human life, property, and the country's economy. Thus, the integrity of a levee is an important issue that needs to be checked frequently. This can be achieved by long-term monitoring of the subsidence of the levee to identify potential weak sections and prioritize maintenance efforts. This paper presents the use of affordable sensing technologies, such as satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), to monitor the settlement of the New Orleans area. Data from TerraSAR-X, the German Space Agency's X-band satellite, was processed with the interferometric point target analysis technique in the gamma remote sensing software for widespread settlement monitoring. The time frame of the data is from 2009 to 2014. In situ measurements from GPS and extensometers are used to verify the remote sensing results, and a good agreement of displacement trends between the two methods was obtained. The favorable comparison increases confidence in the suitability of remote sensing techniques to monitor the long-term displacement of entire levee systems.

TI  - Considering Pluralism Through the Lens of Integral Research
T2  - PLURALISM IN AMERICAN MUSIC EDUCATION RESEARCH: ESSAYS AND NARRATIVES
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Individuals in a pluralist society are actively engaged with diversity, seek a true understanding of differences, are diligent in including varying perspectives, value engagement with one another, and are committed to ongoing, constructive dialogue (Eck, D., From diversity to pluralism. The Pluralism Project at Harvard University, (2006)). Though borrowed from writings on religious pluralism, these principles can be useful for understanding and working toward research pluralism.In this essay, I examine these pluralist principles and consider ways in which the society of music education researchers reflects pluralism. Then, I apply Lessem & Schieffer's (Integral research and innovation: transforming enterprise and society. Gower Publishing, Ltd., Farnham, GB, (2010b)) Integral Research as a framework for the type of criticism necessary for pluralist engagement. I discuss how Integral Research provides a reminder that research decisions ought to be manifestations of an individual's experience, worldview, and cultural perspective, and that the breadth of research approaches must be equitably included in a research community striving for pluralism. As I present an overview of Integral Research, I suggest examples from music education research that reflect particular features of the theory, and highlight a key aspect-that research has little meaning unless it leads directly to social improvement. I draw from Lessem & Schieffer (Integral research and innovation: transforming enterprise and society. Gower Publishing, Ltd., Farnham, GB, (2010b)) and Boyce-Tillman (Boyce-Tillman J Promoting well-being through music education. Philos. Music Educ Rev 89-98 (2000)) to argue that as researchers actively strive for a pluralist research community, we must also look inward, seeking variety and balance in the approaches that we employ. Finally, I suggest that the time is right for music education researchers to consider how our research may directly affect social change.

TI  - Dosimetric quantification of the incidental irradiation of the "true' (deep) ano-inguinal lymphatic drainage of anal cancer patients not described in conventional contouring guidelines
T2  - ACTA ONCOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The ano-inguinal lymphatic drainage (AILD) is located in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of the proximal medial thigh. Findings from fluorescence methods give us new information about anatomical conditions of the AILD. Current contouring guidelines do not advise the inclusion of the true' AILD into the clinical target volume (CTV). Aim of this work was the retrospective analysis of the incidental dose to the AILD in an anal cancer (AC) patient cohort who underwent definitive chemoradiation (CRT) therapy with Volumetric Arc Therapy - Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (VMAT-IMRT).Methods: VMAT-IMRT plans of 15 AC patients were analyzed. Based on findings from new fluorescence methods we created a new volume, the expected AILD. The examined dosimetric parameters were the minimal, maximal and mean dose and V10-V50 that were delivered to the AILD, respectively.Results: The median volume of AILD was 1047cm(3). Mean D-min, D-max and D-mean were 7.5Gy, 58.9Gy and 40.8Gy for AILD. The clinical relevant dose of 30.0 Gray covered in mean 76% of the volume of the AILD, respectively.Conclusions: Only 76% of the AILD-volume received at least an expected required treatment dose of 30Gy incidentally. Concerning the low number of loco-regional relapses in AC patients after definitive CRT one has to balance increased side effects against a rigid oncological-anatomical interpretation of the local lymphatic drainage by including the AILD into the standard CTV.

AB  - Turtles, the most threatened coastal-marine fauna, are protected through both national, and global regulations. However, many of their nesting sites have been degraded in the past years. Completing natal homing, adult females emerged at night to lay-down eggs in the upper intertidal and supra-tidal zone of sandy beach from where they hatched. This study explained coastal topology of beaches usually used for nesting sites, covering 117 km coastline at Pacitan Regency, Southern Java Sea. The shift in beach morphology through times was figured out based on Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2a satellite imagery and remote sensing (GIS methods). This was combined with in-situ data on current coastline features, slope, and tide variations.

AB  - Flood is a major threat to one of the UNESCO world heritage site of India-The Kaziranga National Park. Every year during the monsoon several hundreds of animals which include globally threatened species like single-horned Indian Rhinoceros of Kaziranga lose their lives due to the flood. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can be used to monitoring the flood than the optical remote sensors because of their capability of all-weather and time-independent operability. The microwave L band is most suitable for the flood studies because of its higher penetration capability even through the vegetation. In this study, the advantages of SAR polarimetry and Interferometry of multi-temporal L band dual-pol data of ALOS PALSAR 2 were used to characterize the flooded area and also to monitor the flood extent. The H/A/Alpha decomposition gives a better characterization of the flooded area. The separability analysis is done with a different combination of decomposition parameters and the parameters having high-class separability between water and non-water areas are selected. Polarimetric classification using Random forest classifier is done on these selected decomposition parameters to classify the study into water and non-water areas. The classified images of different months before, during and after the flood time is used to quantitatively estimate the flood extent and for time series analysis. The Interferometric SAR coherence images along with the backscatter images are used to generate the RGB composites which also gives times series information on the flood impact.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors have emerged as the preferred mode of flood monitoring due to their all-weather, all-day imaging capabilities. Current and upcoming SAR satellites provide high-resolutions and shorter revisit times, which can facilitate effective resource allocation during emergency response. However, the sensitivity of microwaves to surface roughness and the side-looking imaging geometry often result in ambiguity in flood detection. This chapter provides an overview of the challenges and opportunities associated with operational SAR-based flood mapping at multiple scales. The principles of SAR imaging are outlined with reference to flood detection problems, and the state-of-the-art solutions proposed in literature to eliminate these effects are critically discussed. Finally, a few selected case studies that demonstrate the potential of SAR-derived extents for operational flood mapping are presented.

TI  - THE POSITION OF MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN ALTAY IN THE EARLY SOVIET YEARS
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to show the results of the studding of the situation of Muslim communities in the territory of the Altai in the context of state-confessional policy in the first years of Soviet power.In connection with the intended purpose, the following tasks were set: to consider of the relationship of the government to Muslim religious education on the territory of the Altai; to nalyze the principles of the formation of the Muslim congregations in the region, studying the attitude towards them by the provincial authorities.A methodological basis of the article is the principles of historicism, objectivity and determinism, which involves a comprehensive critical analysis of historical processes underlying the legal status and functioning of Muslim communities in the Altai region in the first years of Soviet power.This article was prepared on the analysis of normative-legal acts and archival materials reflecting the peculiarities of Muslim communities in the Altai in 1918 - early 1920s. In the course of the study the authors came to the following conclusions that the policy of the state in the 1920s in relation to Muslim peoples was very complex and had contradictory character. Since 1918 the Bolsheviks government had taken the course towards consolidation of ethnic groups who lived on the territory of the state. This government policy could not neglect Muslim people who lived in Altai area. In 1920, Altai Region (Gubernia) Department for Nationalities was established. The responsibilities of the department included collection of statistical data of Altai Region's population as well as eradicating illiteracy among national minorities.In the 1920s, the government started paying special attention to the system of national education. In the early 1920s, the council for national minorities took part in educational activity of Muslim schools by appointing teachers and instructors and by inspecting educating practice. However, regardless many achievements of Muslim communities in education, the government started to abolish denominational schools in 1923. In the first years of the Soviet power the Bolsheviks were eager to demonstrate their loyalty to Muslim communities in Russia. Muslims were even allowed to participate in the World Muslim Congress in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the government declared preferential registration of religious communities that had not been registered yet. But there was an obligation to inform the local department of the State Political Directorate and militia (Soviet police service) about any performance of religious rites pointing out the exact date and place of the performance. This fact is proved by the archive documents reflecting the life of Muslim communities in Altai.In conclusion, the government policy towards people of Islam confession was rather sophisticated and contradictory in the 1920s. The laws adopted in the early Soviet years allowed to hold religious meetings and to teach the basics of Muslim dogma at school. At the same time the life of Muslim communities was strongly interfered by the government. In the mid-1920s the government adopted repressive policies aimed at eradicating the religious worldview in Muslim communities. They started to abolish religious schools; and teaching of the foundations of the Muslim religion was transferred to the mosques. Later, in 1928, teaching of Muslim dogma was completely abolished by the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union.

AB  - Independence of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from weather and sun illumination helps us in maritime surveillance like an oil spill, to identify the illegal fishery activity and unauthorized marine vessels. Detection of marine vessels is like a point target detection in coarse to moderate resolution images. Detection of point targets is adversely affects by speckle noise. Object detection in SAR images, without explicitly reducing the speckle noise is one of the challenging task. In this paper two algorithms are presented, which show how improvement in the power of point target lead us to reduced number of false alarms. The first algorithm has three parts. First part uses Grave matrix, which is a (2x2) Hermitian power matrix, generated by the multiplication of Sinclair matrix and conjugate of Sinclair matrix. Second part uses discrimination criteria to discriminate between clutter and vessels based on eigen value of the Grave matrix (G). The third part, fill the gaps by using morphological dilation. The only difference between the first and the second algorithms is that, in the second algorithm we uses Sinclair matrix (S2) instead of Grave matrix. Both the algorithms tested on two full-polarization (HH, HV, VH, VV) datasets and the results show the importance of scattering power matrix (G) as compared to scattering matrix (S2) for point target detection. The first data set is of size 498*498 captured by AlOS-1 PALSAR L-band data, covering the coastal region of Singapore. The second data set is of size 472*472, covering the coast of Vancouver acquired in C-band by Radarsat-2.

AB  - For improving security of any country, satellite images are playing vital role. Vessels detection using SAR imagery is one of the primary requirements for maritime surveillance. In this paper, the algorithm used for vessels detection has four parts. The first part includes pre-processing to reduce speckle noise, second part helps in the reduction of cross polarization by real and complex rotation of the coherency matrix, third part derives a new parameter called variation of degree of polarization (VD) and fourth one is a post processing part to connect region and fill gaps using morphological operation. The proposed algorithm is tested on ALOS PALSAR1 (space borne L band) and UAVSAR (Airborne L band) datasets and yielded promising results with a relatively few false alarms.

AB  - Mediterranean seagrasses are represented by five species, whose most representative are Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile and Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Ascherson. Spatial data analysis through remote sensing techniques is certainly a useful tool in order to understand and quantify the extent or loss of seagrass areas. Seagrass mapping and monitoring by remote sensing have been established using various optical remote sensors and mapping methods(1) . In most studies for habitat mapping, the most common satellite images used are Landsat, Ikonos, Quickbird, Pleiades, World View 2 and the recent Sentinel-2 etc.(1-2). The aim of this work is to compare the spatial accuracy of medium - resolution satellite images (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 OLI) vs. high-resolution images (MIVIS and WorldView-2) for mapping P. oceanica meadows and evaluating their conservation status. The present study was conducted in 2016 within the MPA "Capo Rizzuto" (Mediterranean Sea - Southern Ionian Sea). Remote sensing images were processed following several stages such as preprocessing phase, segmentation, supervised classification and accuracy classification assessment. Preliminary results highlighted differences in spatial and thematic accuracy between medium and very high spatial resolution images for seagrass habitat mapping.

AB  - Ijen Volcanic Complex (IVC) is located in the easternmost part of Java. This complex consist of three groups of volcanoes including the Old Ijen Caldera, Caldera Rim Volcanoes and Intra Caldera Volcanoes. The complex is expected to have geothermal system which is indicated by the occurrence of Blawan hotspring at the northern part of caldera rim and acid lake on Ijen Crater. The presence of surface manifestation is very rarely in this area The Blawan hotspring represents typical outflow of geothermal system, while the existence of extremely acid lake on Ijen Crates indicates that the area should be avoided for geothermal development. Accordingly, the location of the geothermal system is still hidden and become a challenge to be explored. In order to identify the prospect zone of Blawan-Ijen geothermal area, a landsat data analysis and magnetic survey were conducted. From the landsat analysis, volcanoes and geological structures were delineated to understand the geological condition. Besides, a magnetic survey was also carried out in 2017 for 72 stations using aproximately 1 - 1.5 km grid spacing. The magnetic anomalies were processed using reduced to pole (RTP). The negative magnetic anomalies occur over the southeast part of the study area and also in the western part of the N-S structure. The negative anomaly in the southeast area is probably associated with the hydrothermal demagnetization. This is supported by landsat imagery that shows a volcanic feature right in that area.

AB  - Ijen Volcanic Complex is part of the Quartenary volcanic front of the Sunda Arc. The arc is a subduction system as a result of the northward subduction of the Indo-Australian plate underneath the Eurasian plate. This paper presents remote sensing data analysis and gravity data interpretation to understand the geological structure and its correlation to the geothermal system. The remote sensing analysis is performed using morphostructure approach. Furthermore, the gravity survey also had been carried out in the Ijen Volcanic Complex in 2017. A total of 72 gravity stations were measured with station spacing about 1-1.5 km. The gravity anomaly was then separated into regional and residual anomaly using the first order of TSA method. A high bouguer anomaly found in the southwest area and then continued to the northeast area. The high bouguer anomaly in the southwest area is might be associated with the existence of several volcanoes such as Mt. Mlaten, Mt. Lingker, Mt. Anyar, and Mt. Pendil. Futhermore, the low bouguer anomaly that is seen in the southeast area is probably caused by the collapse of the Mt. Kukusan. Moreover, a high residual gravity anomaly in the center of the caldera is coincided with the geological structure intersection of Kawahwurung fault, Blawan fault and Kendeng-Merapi fault.

AB  - This paper presents three fully convolutional neural network architectures which perform change detection using a pair of coregistered images. Most notably, we propose two Siamese extensions of fully convolutional networks which use heuristics about the current problem to achieve the best results in our tests on two open change detection datasets, using both RGB and multispectral images. We show that our system is able to learn from scratch using annotated change detection images. Our architectures achieve better performance than previously proposed methods, while being at least 500 times faster than related systems. This work is a step towards efficient processing of data from large scale Earth observation systems such as Copernicus or Landsat.

AB  - The Copernicus Sentinel-2 program now provides multispectral images at a global scale with a high revisit rate. In this paper we explore the usage of convolutional neural networks for urban change detection using such multispectral images. We first present the new change detection dataset that was used for training the proposed networks, which will be openly available to serve as a benchmark. The Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) dataset is composed of pairs of multispectral aerial images, and the changes were manually annotated at pixel level. We then propose two architectures to detect changes, Siamese and Early Fusion, and compare the impact of using different numbers of spectral channels as inputs. These architectures are trained from scratch using the provided dataset.

AB  - Crop residues on the soil surface provide defense against erosive forces of water and wind. Quantifying crop residue cover is crucial for monitoring extent of conservation tillage practices. Current multispectral satellite sensors either lack appropriate spectral bands to reliably distinguish crop residue from soil or cannot provide global coverage. Our objective was to estimate crop residue cover in corn and soybean fields in central Iowa by combining data from two multispectral satellites - Landsat-8 and WorldView-3. Shortly after planting in 2016, we measured crop residue cover in > 45 fields using the line-point transect method. Landsat Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI) required local calibrations to account for variations in soils, crops, and moisture conditions. In contrast, WorldView-3 Shortwave Infrared Normalized Difference Residue Index (SINDRI) reliably estimated crop residue cover with minimal ground truth data. Although WorldView-3 images cannot provide global coverage, they can augment and extend ground truth observations for calibrating Landsat indices.

AB  - Plastic pollution in world oceans is estimated to have reached 270.000 tones, or 5.25 trillion pieces. This plastic is now ubiquitous, however due to ocean circulation patterns, it accumulates in the ocean gyres, creating "garbage patches". This plastic debris is colonized by microorganisms which can create unique surfactants and bio-film ecosystems. Microbial colonization is the first step towards disintegration and degradation of plastic materials: a process that releases metabolic by-products from energy synthesis. These by-products include the release of short-chain and more complex carbon molecules in the form of surfactants, which we hypothesize will affect the fluid dynamic properties of waves (change in viscosity and surface tension) and make them detectable by the SAR sensor.In this study we used Sentinel-1A and COSMO-SkyMed SAR images in selected sites of the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans, close to the ocean gyres and away from the coastal interference. Together with SAR processing we conducted contextual image analysis, using ocean geophysical products of the sea surface temperature, surface wind, chlorophyll, wave heights and wave spectrum of the ocean surface. In addition, we started lab experiments under controlled conditions to test the behaviour of microbes colonizing the two most common marine pollutants, polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics. The analysis of the SAR images had shown that a combination of surface wind speed and Langmuir cells-ocean circulation pattern is the main controlling factor in creating the distinct appearance of the surfactants, sea-slicks and microbial bio-films. The preliminary conclusion of our study is that SAR remote sensing may be able to detect plastic pollution in the open oceans and this method can be extended to other areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - We compiled available data and information on the global and regional areas (Ramsar regions), and changes in area, of 22 classes of marine or coastal and inland wetlands. From those classes for which there is information, inland natural surface wetlands (forming similar to 77% of total surface wetland extent) are dominated by non-forested peatlands, marshes and swamps on alluvial soils, with peatlands forming similar to 33% of natural inland wetlands. The smaller area of marine or coastal wetlands (similar to 10% of total wetland extent) is dominated by unvegetated tidal flats and saltmarshes. Largest areas of human-made wetlands for which there is information are rice paddy and water storage bodies, with a much smaller area of tropical oil palm and pulpwood plantations. These human-made wetlands are all increasing in area. The reported decline in global natural wetland area is occurring across almost all classes of inland and marine or coastal natural wetlands. Total global wetland area estimated from these wetland classes is between 15.2 x 10(6) and 16.2 x 10(6) km(2), similar to recent global wetland area estimates derived from remote sensing. Given the considerable data gaps for area of wetland classes, even the most recent other estimates of global wetland extent are likely to be underestimates.

AB  - The methodological aspects of participatory architectural and landscape design in interaction with methods of interactive training in the disciplines "Compositional Modeling" and "Architectural and Landscape Organization of the Territory of Residential and Public Buildings" are considered. The article substantiates the need to introduce active learning and social interaction in the process of professional and additional education of gaming technology architects with the possibility of its direct use here and now. Further, the authors speculate on participation in interactive interaction, activity games, visual fixation of the study of the historically developed language of architectural semantics, a holistic worldview and the ability to solve traditional architectural problems with actual means. The authors provide the methods for the establishment of operative feedback by means of infographic with a designation of a problem and an illustration of means of its decision, use of game prototypes involving citizens of different ages and social status in the collective processes.

M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInfluenza-associated respiratory illness was substantial during the emergence of the 2009 influenza pandemic. Estimates of influenza burden in the post-pandemic period are unavailable to guide Kenyan vaccine policy.ObjectivesTo update estimates of hospitalized and non-hospitalized influenza-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) during a post-pandemic period (2012-2014) and describe the incidence of disease by narrow age categories.MethodsWe used data from Siaya County Referral Hospital to estimate age-specific base rates of SARI. We extrapolated these base rates to other regions within the country by adjusting for regional risk factors for acute respiratory illness (ARI), regional healthcare utilization for acute respiratory illness, and the proportion of influenza-positive SARI cases in each region, so as to obtain region-specific rates.ResultsThe mean annual rate of hospitalized influenza-associated SARI among all ages was 21 (95% CI 19-23) per 100000 persons. Rates of non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI were approximately 4 times higher at 82 (95% CI 74-90) per 100000 persons. Mean annual rates of influenza-associated SARI were highest in children <2years of age with annual hospitalization rates of 147 (95% CI of 134-160) per 100000 persons and non-hospitalization rates of 469 (95% CI 426-517) per 100000 persons. For the period 2012-2014, there were between 8153 and 9751 cases of hospitalized influenza-associated SARI and 31785-38546 cases of non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI per year.ConclusionsThe highest burden of disease was observed among children <2years of age. This highlights the need for strategies to prevent influenza infections in this age group.

AB  - In the wake of the European and global spatial data infrastructures (SDI) it is important to build information systems which use and serve thematic data in compliance with the INSPIRE Directive. In the context of hydrographic data, the Directive requires EU member states to collect and share information on maritime areas divided into regions and sub-regions, as well as coastal zone management areas. These data are part of recently developed marine cadastres. According to the INSPIRE Directive the marine cadastres should be supplemented with information on the physical condition of the seas as well as on the specific natural characteristics and phenomena occurring in the seas. The latter can include dynamic information on marine pollution such as cyanobacterial blooms. The paper presents the concept of dynamic satellite-based cyanobacteria bloom detection for the purpose of its analysis in the context of marine cadastre.

AB  - Water level and distribution is very essential in almost all life aspects. Natural and artificial lakes represent a large percentage of these water bodies in Iraq. In this research the changes in water levels are observed by calculating the areas of five different lakes in five different regions and two different marshes in two different regions of the country, in a period of 12 years (2001 - 2012), archived remotely sensed images were used to determine surface areas around lakes and marshes in Iraq for the chosen years. Level of the lakes corresponding to satellite determined surface areas were retrieved from remotely sensed data. These data were collected to give explanations on lake level and surface area fluctuations. It is important to determine these areas at different water levels to know areas which are being flooded in addition to the total area inundated. The behavior of hydrological regime of these lakes during the period was assessed using an integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques which found that the total surface area of the lakes had diminished and their water volumes reduced. The study further revealed that the levels of the lakes surfaces had lowered through these years.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the geoenvironmental characteristics in the city of Vitoria da Conquista through geoprocessing, especially with the use of remote sensing and SIG, in order to present potential subsidies to environmental planning for the municipality. At the methodological level, we performed a theoretical discussion and, in parallel, the design and preparation of the project chartplotter and the empirical analysis. The geographical data used was the basis vector shapefile format and the data rasters, with images of the Landsat 8 satellite and the SRTM radar, both entered and processed in the free software of Geographic Information System QGIS, and the coordinate reference system used was the SIRGAS 2000 UTM 24S. The environments have potential and specific weaknesses that need to be considered in the process of land use and occupation, which requires a city planning that is more effective and consistent with local reality.

TI  - Fungal diversity in oil palm leaves showing symptoms of Fatal Yellowing disease
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is an excellent source of vegetable oil for biodiesel production; however, there are still some limitations for its cultivation in Brazil such as Fatal Yellowing (FY) disease. FY has been studied for many years, but its causal agent has never been determined. In Colombia and nearby countries, it was reported that the causal agent of Fatal Yellowing (Pudricion del Cogollo) is the oomycete Phytophthora palmivora, however, several authors claim that Fatal Yellowing and Pudricion del Cogollo (PC) are different diseases. The major aims of this work were to test, using molecular biology tools, Brazilian oil palm trees for the co-occurrence of the oomycete Phytophthora and FY symptoms, and to characterize the fungal diversity in FY diseased and healthy leaves by next generation sequencing. Investigation with specific primers for the genus Phytophthora showed amplification in only one of the samples. Analysis of the fungal ITS region demonstrated that, at the genus level, different groups predominated in all symptomatic samples, while Pyrenochaetopsis and unclassified fungi predominated in all asymptomatic samples. Our results show that fungal communities were not the same between samples at the same stage of the disease or among all the symptomatic samples. This is the first study that describes the evolution of the microbial community in the course of plant disease and also the first work to use high throughput next generation sequencing to evaluate the fungal community associated with leaves of oil palm trees with and without symptoms of FY.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to investigate the environmental impacts of Daitari iron-ore mines zone using Landsat TM (2000), Landsat ETM7+ (2010), Landsat8 (2015) and Landsat8 (2017) satellite data. This paper also delineates to propose a land use-land cover (LULC) classification scheme, evaluate their accuracy in different years and to detect the land cover changes from 2000 to 2017 in this mining area using digital image-processing. Supervised classification methodology using maximum likelihood technique was employed in ENVI 4.5 software. It was observed that the built up area and mining area were increased from 8.32% to 29.13% and 14.85% to 30.7% respectively between 2000 and 2017. Also the area with vegetation land was decreased by 47.16% and waste dump increased from 18.2% to 28.7% in Daitari test site area. Finally the mine waste hazard map has been prepared from the spectral characteristics of digital image analysis, laboratory assessment of different elements present at Daitari iron ore mines and getting the idea of generating various maps like contour map, aspect map, flow direction map etc. of this iron ore mines. From the Markov chain analysis, the projected LULC statistics for the year of 2020 has been calculated and the result suggested that iron ore mines area as well as the settlement area will be increased rapidly whereas, vegetation, forest land, barren land and water bodies will be decreased drastically by the year 2020 leading to severe environmental impact.

AB  - Software Defined Vehicular Network (SDVN) is a new network architecture inspired by the well-known Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET), applying the concepts of Software Defined Network (SDN). The SDVN proposes a complete data flow management by a module that controls the routing actions. However, it is necessary to verify that the security requirements are still satisfied. This paper presents Sentinel, a new defense mechanism to detect flooding attack by time series analysis of packet flow and mitigate the attack creating a flow tree to find out the source of spoofed packets. We divided the results between the detection rate of victim vehicles and the efficiency of mitigation method. The algorithm was able to mitigate the attack flow in different parameters. Sentinel reached an average mitigation rate of more than 78% in all densities scenarios.

TI  - What Is the Best Management of cN0pN1(sn) Breast Cancer Patients?
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Although the majority of breast cancer patients are clinically node-negative (cN0) at diagnosis, 15-20% will have a metastatic sentinel lymph node (SLN, pN1(sn)). While a less radical approach regarding axillary surgery in cN0 patients with a positive SLN biopsy is advocated, the limitations of 5 published trials on axillary management in pN1(sn) are discussed intensely in the literature and support the performance of ongoing validation and extension trials, especially considering the lack of data in the setting of mastectomy. As locoregional radiotherapy has a significant effect on both recurrence and survival, a standardization of locoregional radiotherapy in the situation of SLN biopsy alone in pN1(sn) patients has to be defined in the future, and de-escalation trials should embrace a truly multidisciplinary approach. This is also of utmost importance considering the fact that high-volume nodal disease requires an intensified adjuvant chemotherapy strategy to which patients omitting axillary dissection cannot be stratified. Finally, there is mounting evidence that the therapeutic role of extensive axillary surgery in low-volume nodal disease is negligible, and multidisciplinary and translational efforts must be undertaken to individualize treatment in order to gain a reasonable balance between necessary staging information and unnecessary treatment-related morbidity.

T2  - GEO UERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The existence of green areas within the urban area directly influences the improvement of environmental and social conditions. Based on this assumption, the discussions here aim to classify squares as green areas or public spaces, based on their presented functions, such as ecological function, esthetics, leisure and permeable area of 70%. Thus, with the main focus of the city of Montes Claros, the present work seeks to apply the concepts, methods and techniques that assist in the identification, classification, quantification and mapping of the city squares, defining them as green area or free space. The methodology used in the delimitation and classification of the squares was based on the literature review and the use of satellite images with high spatial resolution, as well as in the field work. It was observed that the squares considered as green areas are arranged in a heterogeneous way in the city, occupying from subdivisions with more precarious conditions to more dynamic and structured places, noting that there are still some places that do not have these areas. It is concluded that the city of Montes Claros has about ninety-six squares, of these, eighty-one were classified as free spaces because they have part or none of the functions to be designated as green area and sixteen were considered as green areas because they presented all functions.

AB  - Droughts are natural events that can cause water scarcity and can consequently have undesired political, social and environmental impacts. Since the end of 2013 the southeastern Brazil has suffered the worst drought in 55 years. This severe drought imposes water shortages for approximately 40 million people. Land use and land cover changes may drastically influence local climate, which increases the surface temperature. The aim of this work was to assess the negative impact of aforementioned drought on the vegetation health in a representative watershed in southeastern Brazil. The preliminary results showed the potential of satellite data in identify the drought periods and to classify the severity.

AB  - Google Earth Engine is a cloud computing platform for developing and hosting web applications that allows for the automatic sorting and mapping of terrestrial coverage. The objective this research is to evaluate the tool's potential for the generation of thematic maps of urban areas, using a big data plataform, with data in the cloud. The proposed methodology evaluate the CART classifier for different scales. The local scale considered the area of Rio de Janeiro city. A simplified legend (urban and non-urban) and other with greater detailing (different types of urban intensify), were tested. The main input was the Landsat TOA (Top of Atmosphere) mosaic. Potential, classification time, and results were evaluated. The main products generated were the temporal classifications, in which one can observe the expansion of urban areas and some confusion between classes. In this case editing is necessary. The rapidity in the classification and generation of products is one of the most important positive points of the analysis. The tool is very interactive and easy to handle, even by users with little experience. The urban areas delimitation and identification were promising, requiring more research on the best techniques to be adopted at each geographic scale.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mozambique introduced rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix, GSK Biologicals) in the National Immunization Program in September 2015 with the objective of reducing the burden of total diarrheal disease and specifically severe rotavirus disease. This study aimed to evaluate the early impact of rotavirus vaccine in reducing all-cause diarrhea and rotavirus-specific hospitalizations.METHODS: We analysed stool specimens collected from children under five years old, between January 2014 and June 2017 within the National Surveillance for Acute Diarrhea. We compared annual changes in rotavirus positivity, median age of children hospitalized for rotavirus and the number of all-cause for diarrheal hospitalizations. Rotavirus detection was performed using enzyme immunoassay.RESULTS: During this period, 1296 samples were collected and analyzed. Rotavirus positivity before vaccine introduction was 40.2% (39/97) in 2014 and 38.3% (225/588) in 2015, then after vaccine introduction reduced to 12.2% and 13.5% in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The median age of children hospitalized for rotavirus was 9 and 11 months in 2014 and 2015 and 10 months in 2016 and 2017. Rotavirus hospitalizations exhibited a seasonal peak prior to vaccine introduction, between June and September in 2014 and 2015, coinciding with winter period in Mozambique. After vaccine introduction, the peak was delayed until August to December in 2016 and was substantially diminished. There was a reduction in all-cause acute diarrhea hospitalizations in children aged 0-11 months after vaccine introduction.CONCLUSION: We observed a reduction in rotavirus positivity and in the number of all-cause diarrhea hospitalizations after vaccine introduction. The data suggest rotavirus vaccine is having a positive impact on the control of rotavirus diarrheal disease in Mozambique.

TI  - Operational River Discharge Forecasting with Support Vector Regression Technique Applied to Alpine Catchments: Results, Advantages, Limits and Lesson Learned
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study is to derive a flexible approach based on machine learning techniques, i.e. Support Vector Regression (SVR), for monthly river discharge forecasting with 1-month lead time. The proposed approach has been tested over 300 alpine basins, in order to explore advantages and limits in an operational perspective. The main relevant input features in the forecast performances are the snow cover areas and the discharge behavior of the previous years. Forecasts obtained by training SVR machine on single gauging stations show better performances than the average of the previous 10 years, considered as benchmark, in 94% of the cases, with a mean improvement of about 48% in root mean square error. In case of poorly gauged basins, to increase the number of training sample, multiple basins have been considered to train the SVR machine. In this case, performances are still better than the benchmark, even if worse than those of SVR machine trained on single basins, with a decrease of the performances ranging from 13% to 54%.

TI  - Narrative learning for democratic citizenship identity: a theoretical framework
T2  - EDUCATIONAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholars in different fields have theorised about the value of narrative learning and narrative education for advancing components of civic professional and worldview development. Whilst research into the theory and practice of narrative learning is more widespread in adult and religious education, it is still scarce in the area of democratic citizenship education. This article reports a theoretical social scientific inquiry into the key characteristics of narrative democratic citizenship education. After defining the key elements of narrative learning and the educational philosophy this study is based on, it elaborates on four modes of narrative learning in democratic citizenship education: learning from narratives; learning in the process of narrating; learning by recognising personal and cultural narratives; and learning by locating these narratives. It then illustrates how each mode of narrative learning can contribute to advancing democratic citizenship identity and cultural narratives on good citizenship and the good society. Building on this framework and the work of educational researchers who specialise in civics or narrative learning, the article concludes with a discussion of the desirability of employing narrative learning to cultivate citizenship identity in formal education.

TI  - Atmospheric correction of Landsat-8/OLI and Sentinel-2/MSI data using iCOR algorithm: validation for coastal and inland waters
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image correction for atmospheric effects (iCOR) is an atmospheric correction tool that can process satellite data collected over coastal, inland or transitional waters and land. The tool is adaptable with minimal effort to hyper- or multi-spectral radiometric sensors. By using a single atmospheric correction implementation for land and water, discontinuities in reflectance within one scene are reduced. iCOR derives aerosol optical thickness from the image and allows for adjacency correction, which is SIMilarity Environmental Correction (SIMEC) over water. This paper illustrates the performance of iCOR for Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data acquired over water. An intercomparison of water leaving reflectance between iCOR and Aerosol Robotic Network - Ocean Color provided a quantitative assessment of performance and produced coefficient of determination (R-2) higher than 0.88 in all wavebands except the 865 nm band. For inland waters, the SIMEC adjacency correction improved results in the rededge and near-infrared region in relation to optical in situ measurements collected during field campaigns.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART B-PESTICIDES FOOD CONTAMINANTS AND AGRICULTURAL WASTES
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of field-based biomarkers can allow for a more reliable assessment of the exposure of organisms to pollutants. Different sampling sites, along two streams running through an irrigable agricultural area, were selected to evaluate the effect of agrochemical load on the measured endpoints. The levels of lipid peroxidation were evaluated in several organs of Procambarus clarkii. The same method was applied to leaves of two woody species. Determining levels of MDA (malonaldehyde) by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay allows measuring the levels of lipid peroxidation. Differences in lipid peroxidation levels were observed in P. clarkii individuals collected at different sites; however, the patterns varied depending on the organ (when accounting for variations due to sex). The use of a MDA-gills/MDA-hepatopancreas index allowed for discrimination between reference and polluted sites. Significant differences in oxidative damage between sites were found in the leaves of Quercus rotundifolia but not in Salix sp. The lipid peroxidation of crayfish organs and holm oak leaves as a suitable biomarker of environmental pollution deserves further investigation.

M3  - Article
AB  - The use of geoprocessing and remote sensing techniques in the studies of quantification of the vegetation cover contributes to an efficiency and reliability in the analyzes that involve the processes of degradation of the natural vegetation, since the vegetation indexes are indicators of environmental quality. The Eastern Serido Paraiba is a region that presents strong indications of environmental degradation due to the inadequate use and exploitation of natural resources. This study aimed to analyze the spatial-temporal dynamics of vegetal soil cover of Serido city in Paraiba, in the years 1990 and 2013. Have been elaborated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps and Adjusted multispectral compositions (AMC) Using SPRING software, version 5.4.2, using orbital images TM / LANDSAT 5 for the year 1990 and TM / LANDSAT 8 for the year 2013 acquired in the collection of images of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE). The temporal scale of analysis allowed to verify throughout the period of 23 years the variation of the vegetation cover of the region, characterized by the increase of degraded areas due to anthropic activities, rendering the region unfit for agricultural activities.

AB  - In this work we present a fully parallel and automatic interferometric processing chain, based on the well-known advanced DInSAR algorithm referred to as Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS), for the effective and massive generation of Sentinel1 (S-1) Interferometric Wide Swath (IWS) displacement time-series and corresponding mean deformation velocity maps of very wide areas. The strategy chosen to implement such a parallel processing chain fully benefits from the Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode characterizing the IWS acquisitions of the S-1 constellation for systematic monitoring of large land and coastal areas. The TOPS mode consists of a series of bursts that can be considered as separate images to be independently processed. Such a data structure fosters the parallelization of the S-1 IWS interferometric data processing, which can be automatically carried out through the exploitation of both high-performance distributed computing infrastructures and efficient algorithms for tackling the huge data flow provided by the S-1 constellation. To demonstrate the capability of the presented S-1 P-SBAS processing chain to deal with the huge volume of data acquired by the S-1 constellation, we process a very extended dataset acquired over the Italian territory from which we compute the mean velocity maps and associated deformation time-series.

AB  - In this study, coherent co-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) information is exploited for sea oil seep monitoring purposes. A time series of 33 TerraSAR-X StripMap SAR data, collected over a well-known oil seep in Gulf of Mexico, is exploited to analyze the influence of incidence angle and wind conditions on the co-polarized phase difference (CPD). Furthermore, the benefits of using phase information for oil seep observation are assessed. Experimental results show that: i) incidence angle has a remarkable effect in broadening/shrinking the CPD statistical distribution and, ii) the CPD provides spatial information on the oil seep damping properties.

AB  - Abstract Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) and Duffy-negative blood group are two red blood cells variants that confer protection against malaria. In this study, the distribution of the most common G6PD variants (G6PD*A-, GGPD*A and G6PD Mediterranean) and the major alleles of the Duffy blood group (FY*A, FY*B and FY*BES) were investigated in an Afro-descendant population from state of Para, Brazilian Amazon. G6PD variants and Duffy blood group alleles were determined by TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Overall, molecular genotyping revealed the presence of G6PD variants in 126 (24%) of the individuals studied (5% male and 19% female), and frequencies of the G6PD*A- and G6PD*A alleles were 0.061 and 0.104, respectively. Duffy blood group genotyping showed that 24.3% of people were Duffy-negative and 41.3% were heterozygous for FY*BES. The frequency of allele FY*BES was 41.0%. The results emphasize the need to monitor G6PD deficiency for the use of primaquine in the routine care of the Afro-descendant communities of the Trombetas, Erepecuru and Cumna rivers, evaluating the risks of hemolytic crisis in case of recurrence of malaria in the region. In addition, the possible greater protection against malaria conferred by these erythrocyte polymorphisms deserves to be better investigated and explored among these Afro-descendants.

TI  - Object-based land-cover change detection applied to Brazilian seasonal savannahs using geostatistical features
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new method for remote-sensing land-use/land-cover (LULC) change detection is proposed to eliminate the effects of forest phenology on classification results. This method is insensitive to spectral changes caused by vegetation seasonality and uses an object-based approach to extract geostatistical features from bitemporal Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) images. We first create image objects by multiresolution segmentation to extract geostatistical features (semivariogram parameters and indices) and spectral information (average values) from NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), acquired in the wet and dry seasons, as input data to train a Support Vector Machine algorithm. We also used the image difference traditional change-detection method to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We used two classes: (1) LULC change class and (2) seasonal change class. Using the most geostatistical features, the change detection results are considerably improved compared with the spectral features and image differencing technique. The highest accuracy was achieved by the sill (sigma(2) overall variability) semivariogram parameter (95%) and the AFM (area first lag-first maximum) semivariogram index (88.33%), which were not affected by vegetation seasonality. The results indicate that the geostatistical context makes possible the use of bitemporal NDVI images to address the challenge of accurately detecting LULC changes in Brazilian seasonal savannahs, disregarding changes caused by phenological differences, without using a dense time series of remote-sensing images. The challenge of extracting accurate semivariogram curves from objects of long and narrow shapes requires further study, along with the relationship between the scale of segmentation and image spatial resolution, including the type of change and the initial land-cover class.

TI  - A Novel Technique Based on Deep Learning and a Synthetic Target Database for Classification of Urban Areas in PolSAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of urban areas in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data is a challenging task. Moreover, urban structures oriented away from the radar line of sight pose an additional complexity in the classification process. The characterization of such areas is important for disaster relief and urban sprawl monitoring applications. In this paper, a novel technique based on deep learning is proposed, which leverages a synthetic target database for data augmentation. The PolSAR dataset is rotated by uniform steps and collated to form a reference database. A stacked autoencoder network is used to transform the information in the augmented dataset into a compact representation. This significantly improves the generalization capabilities of the network. Finally, the classification is performed by a multilayer perceptron network. The modular architecture allows for easy optimization of the hyperparameters. The synthetic target database is created and the classification performance is evaluated on an L-band airborne UAVSAR dataset and L-band space-borne ALOS-2 dataset acquired over San Francisco, USA. The proposed technique shows an overall accuracy of 91.3%. An improvement over state-of-the-art techniques is achieved, especially in urban areas rotated away from the radar line of sight.

AB  - This paper presents a novel framework for snow cover mapping with multi-basis Poincare sphere parameters obtained from full-polarimetric SAR images in conjunction with an Auto-Encoder neural network. The neural network comprises of two stages where an unsupervised stochastic sampling Auto-Encoder (AE) learns a summarized representation of multi-basis polarimetric SAR data, and a supervised Feed Forward (If) network performs classification. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated for snow-cover mapping using the Radarsat-2 (FQ-28) C-band full-polarimetric SAR datasets acquired over the Manali-Dhundi region of-Himachal Pradesh, India, The results are visualized along with the NDSI-based snow cover map derived from the LANDSAT-8 imagery for the region.

AB  - The process of coastal erosion is a global problem that impacts approximately 70% of coastal regions of the Earth. It causes loss of property, infrastructure, and biodiversity, besides generating major economic impacts. Therefore, the analysis and monitoring of coastal erosion is an issue that needs to be addressed. In this sense, remote-sensing data have been widely used in studies that evaluate the spatial and temporal changes of land use. In addition, the use of time series of satellite imagery applied in the investigation of changes in the Earth's coverage and its spatio-temporal pattern has been proven as an extremely efficient approach. Thus, remote sensing and geoprocessing are effective techniques to obtain continuous and dynamic information from coastal regions at different levels and scales. In this context, the main objective of this work was to create a prognostic model for the generation of future scenarios, based on the analysis of the spatial-temporal changes of the shorelines from past decades to the present, having as the pilot area the coast of the municipality of Icapui, in the State of Ceara, Northeastern Brazil. For that, Statistical Regression technique was used. In addition, the techniques of Digital Image Processing and the extraction of the modified normalized difference water index were used. As a result, the prognosis of coastal erosion was generated for the year 2021, based on the time series of the years 1985, 1991, 1997, 2003, 2009, and 2015. After the extrapolation process, the results were validated through the mean absolute error. Furthermore, through the Python programming language and the OpenCV library, a computational solution was implemented to be executed in a Geographic Information Systems environment that automated the process of generating future prognostic and the extraction of the shoreline in a shapefile format.

TI  - Combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to monitor irrigation in sugar cane
T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XX

AB  - This article analyzed the application of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 for monitoring and controlling irrigation in sugarcane production by vinasse (residue of industrial ethanol-sugar manufacturing), a sub-product highly rich in organic matter and minerals, which is used as fertilizer after harvesting, during the months of drought for the plant to regrow. Irrigation with vinasse is a complex process and its lack of use or excess can causes important losses in tonnage of sugarcane. The insufficient spraying of vinasse was identified in the Sentinel-2 image of April 2017 in a farm plantation as the principal cause of stress in the development of the plant in an area representing 21% of the plantation (100 hectares). This represented a total loss of 4335 tons of cane (approximate to$90000). The identification of the cause of the reduced growth was made possible through analyzing a Sentinel-2 image of July 2016 that showed clearly that no vinasse was spread in the same 100 hectares with cane growing problem. The presence/lack of vinasse was easily detectable using the visible bands of the S-2 image but the difference in growth/stress was better related to the red edge and near infrared bands in the January image. To thoroughly complete our investigation we also acquired a Sentinel-1 radar image of April 2017 where the lack of vinasse could not directly be identified but the effect on the growth can be readily interpreted. This evaluation was extended to other farming facilities and a coefficient of determination of -0.7 was obtained between the production rate per hectare and the plantation where lack of vinasse could be identified in 41 fields. We proposed a systematic approach to monitor the spreading of vinasse with Sentinel-2 images and Sentinel-1 radar images in an effort to increase efficiency.

AB  - This works aims to study tar sand outcrops in the Parana basin, Brazil, using multi-scale spectral sensing technologies. Sites in this basin comprise well-exposed outcrops of tar sands for which a wealth of orbital, airborne, field and lab spectral data is currently available, including WorldView-3 (WV-3; DigitalGlobe) over the entire study area. The area was also surveyed by the AisaFENIX hyperspectral system both from field-based and airborne platforms. This was followed by outcrop studies and sampling in the field and close-range spectroscopy using both hyperspectral imaging (i.e. Specim's sisuCHEMA) and nonimaging (ASD's FieldSpec) instruments in the laboratory. The aim of the work is twofold: (i) to detect the tar sands at multiple scales, and (ii) to describe the alteration mineralogy associated with bitumen emplacement in sandstone beds, drawing an analogy between this phenomenon and the microseepage-induced alteration.

AB  - The main of this paper is to realize the mapping of deforestation features caused by mining activities in the southwest region of the state of Para, which is part of the Amazon Region. This goal was reached by employing satellite images of medium resolution, from the satellites Resourcesat-II, using the AWiFS sensor, and CBERS-4, WFI sensor. The results showed that 19% of the deforestation polygons caused by mining were situated in areas that did not have any registered requisition of research and/or exploitation concession given by the competent government organs, which might indicate that they were irregular. Therefore, the mapping executed in this paper contributes to the control and monitoring of mining activity in a region with great importance to environmental conservancy.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Leptospirosis is a potentially fatal emerging zoonosis with worldwide distribution and a broad range of clinical presentations and exposure risks. It typically affects vulnerable populations in (sub) tropical countries but is increasingly reported in travelers as well. Diagnostic methods are cumbersome and require further improvement. Here, we describe leptospirosis among travelers presenting to the GeoSentinel Global Surveillance Network. We performed a descriptive analysis of leptospirosis cases reported in GeoSentinel from January 1997 through December 2016. We included 180 travelers with leptospirosis (mostly male; 74%; mostly tourists; 81%). The most frequent region of infection was Southeast Asia (52%); the most common source countries were Thailand (N = 52), Costa Rica (N = 13), Indonesia, and Laos (N = 11 each). Fifty-nine percent were hospitalized; one fatality was reported. We also distributed a supplemental survey to GeoSentinel sites to assess clinical and diagnostic practices. Of 56 GeoSentinel sites, three-quarters responded to the survey. Leptospirosis was reported to have been most frequently considered in febrile travelers with hepatic and renal abnormalities and a history of freshwater exposure. Serology was the most commonly used diagnostic method, although convalescent samples were reported to have been collected infrequently. Within GeoSentinel, leptospirosis was diagnosed mostly among international tourists and caused serious illness. Clinical suspicion and diagnostic workup among surveyed GeoSentinel clinicians were mainly triggered by a classical presentation and exposure history, possibly resulting in underdiagnosis. Suboptimal usage of available diagnostic methods may have resulted in additional missed, or misdiagnosed, cases.

TI  - Rents, Actors, and the Expansion of Commodity Frontiers in the Gran Chaco
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Theories of frontier expansion in the last four decades have been mostly shaped by studies of state-driven smallholder colonization. Modern-day agricultural frontiers, however, are increasingly driven by capitalized corporate agriculture operating with little direct government intervention. The expansion of contemporary frontiers has been explained by the existence of spatially heterogeneous "abnormal" rents, which can be caused by cheap land and labor, technological innovation, lack of regulations, and a variety of other incentives. Here, we argue that understanding the dynamics of these frontiers requires considering the differential ability of actors to capture such rents, which depends on their access to production factors and their information, preferences, and agency. We propose a new conceptual framework drawing on neoclassical economics and political economy, which we apply to the South American Gran Chaco, a hot spot of deforestation for soy and cattle production. We divide the region into a set of distinct frontiers based on satellite data, field interviews, and expert knowledge, to review the drivers and actors of agricultural expansion in these frontiers. We show that frontier expansion in the Chaco responded to the rents created by new agricultural technologies, infrastructure, and rising producer prices but that the frontier dynamics were strongly influenced by actors' abilities to capture or influence these rents. Our findings thus highlight that understanding contemporary commodity frontiers requires analyzing the novel ways by which the agency of particular groups of actors shapes land-use outcomes.

AB  - It has been now widely assessed in the literature that both multi/hyperspectral optical images and 3D lidar point clouds are necessary inputs for tree species based forest stand detection. Nevertheless, no comprehensive analysis of the genuine relevance of each data source has been performed so far: existing strategies are limited to a single spatial and spectral resolution. This paper investigates which is the optimal combination of geospatial optical images and lidar point clouds. A supervised semantic segmentation framework is fed with various sources (multispectral satellite and airborne images, hyperspectral airborne images, low, medium and high density lidar point clouds), ablation cases are defined, and the discrimination performance of several fusion schemes is assessed under a challenging mountainous area in France.

M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research was to develop a model for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration, SST and kd(490) on the Northwest Persian gulf by means of a high resolution landsat8 image. Field studies were conducted monthly (two months of every season of year including Feb, March, April, May, July, Agust, Oct and Nov) from water concurrent with the passage of satellite in Mousa estuaies on 14th Feb 2014 to 13th Nov 2014 from 3 station located in the northwest Persian gulf. Temperature, Secchi disk depth, chl-a, kd and zeu was measured in this study. The Chl-a concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 1.6 mg m-3, with an average of 0.6 +/- 0.42 mg m(-3). Only two algorithms OC-2 and Morel-3 could meet the requirements of the evaluation criteria. The values for Kd(490) were highest(0.86) in July and lowest (0.59m) in February. The optimal SST model was found in this zone. The retrieval accuracy (R2) was 0.63, while the root mean square (RMSE) was 0.81. The highest (31c degrees) temperature was found in July and lowest temperature(15.1c degrees) was found in Feb. There was a significant positive correlation between Kd(490) and chl-a. There was a significant positive correlation between SST and chl-a.

AB  - Purpose: (a) To compare the axillary tumor burden detected by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) versus sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). (b) To evaluate the relationship between axillary tumor burden and the number of suspicious lymph nodes detected by axillary ultrasonography (US). (c) To calculate the false-positive and false-negative rates for FNAC in patients fulfilling ACOSOG Z0011 criteria.Methods: Retrospective multicenter cross-sectional study of 355 pT1 breast cancers. SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were gold standards. Low axillary burden (<= 2 positive lymph nodes); high burden (> 2 positive lymph nodes). Patients ACOSOG Z0011: false-positive (positive FNAC + low burden), false-negative (negative FNAC + high burden).Results: High axillary burden: in entire series 38.5% FNAC+ vs. 5.7% SLNB+ (p < 0.0001). In subgroup fulfilling ACOSOG Z0011 criteria: 45.5% vs 6.7%, respectively (p < 0.001).61 positive axillary US. With 1 suspicious node on axillary US: 95.6% had <= 2 involved nodes (including pN0); with 2 suspicious nodes: 60% had > 2 involved nodes. In ACOSOG Z0011 patients, with 1 suspicious node, 93.7% had <= 2 involved nodes. Of the 37 FNAC in ACOSOG Z0011patients: 54.5% false-positives for high burden; 3.8% false-negatives.Conclusions: FNAC-positive tumors have greater axillary burden, even in patients fulfilling ACOSOG Z0011 criteria. Using axillary US/FNAC to triage patients meeting Z0011 criteria may result in axillary overtreatment. The number of suspicious nodes seen in axillary US is related with the final axillary burden and should be taken into account when deciding to do FNAC in patients fulfilling ACOSOG Z0011 criteria.

TI  - Monitoring Hydro Temporal Variability in Alberta, Canada with Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Freely available high temporal and spatial resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data such as Sentinel-1 have made it possible for almost near-real time monitoring of surface water extent. We present a method to track temporal variability in surface water extent, hereafter hydro temporal variability (HTV) in Alberta, Canada. Multi-temporal Sentinel-1-C band SAR data was used to classify each pixel in a pixel stack across time into water or non-water. This dataset can tell the percent of time a given 10m x 10m pixel was seen as open water. HTV was then summarized by calculating the percentage of the total pixel stack, which was detected as water. Comparison to the waterbodies in the Government of Alberta Base Features Hydrography Polygon dataset shows that the HTV dataset is able to differentiate between permanent and recurring lakes as well as capture rivers with a width of over 30m. It is anticipated that the methodology presented here will be further enhanced and refined with imagery available for 2018 and beyond, due to now operational Sentinel-1B satellite and future RADARSAT Constellation Mission (2018), which will both provide improved data opportunities.

AB  - This paper provides an analytical formulation of the time required to form a cloud that can be considered as a randomly distributed one around the Earth after a breakup of a satellite. Starting with a set of arbitrary A V, we determine typical values of the mean changes of velocity within the cloud that enable to describe the changes induced on the initial orbital keplerian elements. The sensitivity of the approach is investigated, and a comparison with Fengyun-1C TLE data sets is provided. The study is carried out following an analytical approach jointly with a statistical characterization.

TI  - Intraoperative imprint cytology <i>versus </i>histological diagnosis for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - CLINICS
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare imprint cytology and paraffin section histology for sentinel lymph node detection in women with breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHOD: A cross-sectional study and report of the sentinel lymph node statuses of 64 patients with breast cancer who underwent intraoperative imprint cytology and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a referral cancer institute in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 2014 and 2016.RESULTS: The mean age was 51 years. The most common histological type was invasive ductal carcinoma (93.75%), and the most common differentiation grade was 2 (62.5%). Overall, 153 lymph nodes were identified, with a mean of 2.39/case. Thirty-four lymph nodes tested positive for malignancy by imprint cytology, and 55 tested positive by histology. Of the 55 positive lymph nodes, 41 (74.5%) involved macrometastases, and 14 (25.5%) involved micrometastases. There were 21 false negatives with imprint cytology, namely, 7 for macrometastases and 14 for micrometastases, resulting in a rate of 17.6%. The sensitivity of imprint cytology was 61.8%, with a specificity and positive predictive value of 100%, a negative predictive value of 82.4% and an accuracy of 86.3%. The method presented null sensitivity for the identification of micrometastases.CONCLUSIONS: The false-negative rate with imprint cytology was associated with the number of sentinel lymph nodes obtained. The rate found for complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was comparable to the rates reported in the literature. The accuracy of imprint cytology was good, and its specificity was excellent for sentinel lymph node detection; however, the method was unable to detect lymph node micrometastases.

TI  - Model of Situation as Basis for Comparison of Lexical Semantics
T2  - PSYCHOLINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper focuses on the model of situation concept - a representation that constitutes the basis for comparison (tertium comparationis) in contrasting the semantics of lexical items in related and non-related languages. The expediency of using the model of situation concept as the basis for comparison agrees with an assumption of universality and uniqueness of situation conceptualization. From this viewpoint, the content of a linguistic item's semantics is viewed within the dialectics of relations between the universality of human cognition and the uniqueness of conceptualization. The model of situation concept is analyzed as a propositional function in which the arguments represent the conceptualization of a perception object, whilst the predicate - a cognitive conception of the conceptualization itself From this perspective, the model of situation concept represents the content of a lexical item as the realization of relations between the basic participants of a given situation. The concept of situation is represented as a configuration of semantic linguistic dimensions - the characteristics of lexical items' planes of content that encode information on a certain aspect of a situation or its fragment conceptualization. The relevance of the model being a representation of multidimensional semantic space is verified based on the results of the subjective scaling procedure. It has been ascertained that the lexical items' semantics of contrasted languages encode and distribute information among four semantic linguistic dimensions: representational, sentential, relational, and epidigmatic. It is posited that the representational semantic dimension encodes information on cognitive values of situation participants, the sentential one - on a set and relations of situation participants, the relational one - on the degree of positional activities or salience of situation participants, the epidigmatic one - on the mechanisms and strategies of a situation concept extension. In order to ascertain the content of situation concept and to establish the ways the information is encoded and distributed in the semantics of lexical items, a directed associative experiment has been used. In reproducing the specificity of the worldview, the expediency of further psycholinguistic research of lexical semantic models in cognitive, functional, and comparative aspects is claimed.

TI  - HOW IS THE WORD "TAKE" IN CHINESE? ON THE SEMANTICS AND TEACHING OF CORRESPONDING CHINESE VERBS
T2  - 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI2018)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 11th Annual International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)

AB  - This study was conducted within the framework of an interdisciplinary linguodidactic aspect. The purpose of the article is to describe the semantics of Chinese verbs, which denote the actions "take" in its specific physical manifestation. The relevance in the description of verbs that correspond exactly with this area of extralinguistic reality is caused by the need for practical teaching of the Chinese language and theoretical interpretation of results in a cognitive-semantic manner. As the practice of teaching has shown, an emphasis on this particular area causes the greatest difficulties in the study of the language and, at the same time, these verbs are of interest from the linguistic point of view as the most contrastive in comparison with the languages of a different topology. The novelty of the study is that the semantics of the Chinese language as a whole has been poorly studied and little attention is paid to it in teaching.The study was conducted within the framework of the semantic-comparative and descriptive methods implemented in the strategy of the lexico-semantic field or lexico-semantic group. Specific techniques include the analysis of definitions of lexico-semantic units found in the explanatory dictionary of modern Chinese.The conclusions that were made upon results of the study concern the fact that this extralinguistic area in Chinese is sufficiently fractionally nominated by linguistic units and has no dominant representative that would be equal to the verb "Take" in content. The main semantic features (components) inherent in these verbs are the signs associated with the instrument of action, the strategy of its commission, the trajectory of movement and other mainly figurative-visual "pictures" of extremely specific content.The results of the study are significant not only for teaching the language, but can also be used for general understanding of the features of the verbal semantics of the Chinese language as specifically idioethnic and shedding light on mental-cognitive features of Chinese linguistic thinking and the special worldview of the Chinese.

AB  - We present the DeepGlobe 2018 Satellite Image Understanding Challenge, which includes three public competitions for segmentation, detection, and classification tasks on satellite images (Figure 1). Similar to other challenges in computer vision domain such as DAVIS[21] and COCO[33], DeepGlobe proposes three datasets and corresponding evaluation methodologies, coherently bundled in three competitions with a dedicated workshop co-located with CVPR 2018.We observed that satellite imagery is a rich and structured source of information, yet it is less investigated than everyday images by computer vision researchers. However, bridging modern computer vision with remote sensing data analysis could have critical impact to the way we understand our environment and lead to major breakthroughs in global urban planning or climate change research. Keeping such bridging objective in mind, DeepGlobe aims to bring together researchers from different domains to raise awareness of remote sensing in the computer vision community and vice-versa. We aim to improve and evaluate state-of-the-art satellite image understanding approaches, which can hopefully serve as reference benchmarks for future research in the same topic. In this paper, we analyze characteristics of each dataset, define the evaluation criteria of the competitions, and provide baselines for each task.

AB  - Developing new metrics for spatial pattern comparison of observed and simulated variables has been planned as major part of the first work package (WP1) of the SPACE project. This goal was achieved by developing SPAtial EFficiency metric (SPAEF) described below. For that first we have extensively investigated the current state-of-art spatial comparison metrics. We tested available metrics such as coefficient of variation, correlation coefficient, Goodman and Kruskal's lambda [1], Mapcurves [2], agreement coefficient [3], FSS, Theil's Uncertainty, EOF and Cramer's V [4]-[6] in calibration of a distributed hydrologic model. However, after many calibration attempts we found them inadequate due to the unexpected resultant visual patterns resulted in high correlation but too low standard deviation or highly separate groups. Therefore, we introduced a brand-new multi-component SPAEF metric in Demirel et al. [7] which showed the utility of SPAEF in an ensemble model calibration case. For further comparison of the SPAEF with other metrics and particularly analyzing each component separately in a calibration framework please refer to the subsequent study by Koch et al.[8]. Illustrative examples and source codes are available in Python, R and Matlab [9].

AB  - Food and agriculture sector forms the largest piece of gross world product. Due to the increasing world population, global climate change, environmental deteriorations such as nitrogen pollution and desertification, agriculture sector is expected to face significant problems to supply the drastically increasing demand. Timely and accurate estimation of agricultural crop yields is essential for food security; in addition strategically and economically significant for a wide range of actors on the sector; from singular producers to governments. Remote sensing provides more practical and less costly solutions than conventional methods for crop yield forecasting. Sentinel-2 satellites have a great potential for agricultural remote sensing applications due to its vegetation bands and also having the highest spatial resolution in red, green, blue and NIR bands within the satellites whose data is open and free publicly. In this work, the use of Sentinel-2 vegetation indices for yield estimation of barley is analyzed. Commonly used vegetation indices are calculated from two closely dated Sentinel-2 images acquired before the harvest. Linear regression models are constructed between the indices and actual yields. Correlation coefficients are found promising for the yield estimation of barley. Highest correlation coefficients are obtained by the Modified Simple Ratio index.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing techniques and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for agricultural activities is becoming increasingly popular. Benefitting from remote sensing, essential functions, including cropland coverage estimation and monitoring, can be achieved. As the reflectance values of the same product type can differ with respect to soil characteristics, this research aims to investigate the relationship between the soil properties and the cropland reflectance values. In this study, 104 wheat-barley parcels and 26 potato parcels in the Central Anatolia region of Turkey were chosen from two different districts; Haymana and Bunyan. To disclose the relationship, images from the Sentinel 2 satellite was downloaded for predefined parcels during one season of production. Digital numbers (DN) of satellite images have been changing according to species phenological stages for each band, therefore, there are no standard soil reflection values even for the same crop species. In this study, the reflection characteristics of two plant species grown on different coloured soils were investigated. As a result of this research, soil properties which include soil colour, water holding capacity and mineral composites should be considered for the determination of the reference for reflection values of cropland.

TI  - Vegetation condition prediction for drought monitoring in pastoralist areas: a case study in Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought monitoring, and its impact management planning, has been a challenge for decision makers mainly because of lack of reliable information and decision support tools. The main objective of the study was to develop a remote sensing-based vegetation condition drought-monitoring approach for pastoralist areas using multi-temporal and spatial resolution satellite, climate, and biophysical datasets. Twenty-four years of data (1983-2006) from 11 attributes were extracted and used for developing the prediction models. A classification and regression tree (CART) modelling technique was used to integrate and model the drought parameters. Using the CART models, drought predictio n maps were produced for 2016, and the model outputs agreed with what had been reported by government and humanitarian partners of Ethiopia. The methodology can be used for future drought monitoring and early warning for risk-based (rather than crisis-based) drought planning. Future research may improve both the spatial and administrative resolution of the model so that drought status can be determined at district levels, which will be useful for actual drought mitigation planning.

AB  - For an expert witness providing comment on GNSS data, there is very little guidance in the literature regarding quality and admissibility of evidence. Conversely, the remote sensing community has developed quite a significant body of work. This paper examines firstly where and how GNSS data evidence can be compromised, and how a court can be informed of potential problems. Some of these problems are generic to the discipline of digital forensics, some are specific to GNSS, and some share characteristics with other methods of sensing. The various methodologies applied to remotely sensed data evidence are then examined to see where ideas can be readily transferred, and where new approaches are required.

TI  - Enhanced system for maternal mortality surveillance in France, context and methods
T2  - ANESTHESIE & REANIMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Maternal mortality, despite its rarity in rich countries, remains a fundamental indicator of maternal health. It is considered as a "sentinel event'', consequence of dysfunctions of the health care system, often cumulative. In addition to the classical epidemiological surveillance outcomes-number of deaths, maternal mortality ratio and identification of the subgroups of women at risk-its study allows an accurate analysis of each deceased woman's trajectory to identify opportunities for improvements in the content or organization of care; the correction of which will make it possible to prevent deaths but also upstream morbid events affected by the same dysfunctions. To achieve this dual epidemiological and clinical audit objective, an ad hoc enhanced system is needed. France has had such a system since 1996, the National Confidential enquiry into maternal deaths (ENCMM), coordinated by the Inserm Epope team. The first step is the multi-source identification (direct declaration, death certificate, birth certificates, hospital discharge data) of women who died during pregnancy or within one year of its end. The second step is the collection of detailed information for each death by a pair of clinical assessors. The third stage is the review of these anonymized documents by the National Committee of Experts on Maternal Mortality, which judges whether the death is maternal (causal link) and makes a judgment on the adequacy of care and avoidability of death. The synthesis of the information thus collected for maternal deaths in the period 2010-2012 is the subject of the last report.

TI  - Near-infrared fluorescence imaging in the largely unexplored window of 900-1,000 nm
T2  - THERANOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has relied on fluorophores that emit in the 700-900 nm NIR-Ia or 1,000-1,700 nm NIR-II window for generating deep-tissue images. Up until now, there have been few fluorophores developed for the 900-1,000 nm NIR-Ib window. This is largely because NIR-Ib light is thought to be strongly absorbed by water.Methods: Here we found that six heptamethine dyes had distinct emission peaks in both the NIR-Ia and NIR-Ib window. We tested the performance of these contrast agents by introducing them into the leaves of the common house plant Epipremnum aureum with early stage anthracnose leaf infections from Khaya senegalensis, as well as injecting them into the hind feet of nude mice and tails of tumour-bearing mice in vivo.Results: Heptamethine dyes yielded superior images of leaf venation, anthracnose infection locations, sentinel lymph nodes, brain tumours and subcutaneous tumours in the NIR-Ib window. We found that NIR-Ib images had markedly enhanced signal-to-background ratio because autofluorescence, scattering and light absorption by biological tissues and water were weaker at longer wavelengths.Conclusion: NIR-Ib fluorescence imaging was a powerful method for studying sentinel lymph nodes, tumours, leaf veins and early anthracnose infection locations in plant leaves. The findings challenge our current view of NIR fluorescence imaging and may have important implications for biomedical research and image-guided cancer surgery.

TI  - Assessment of the geolocation accuracy of YG-13A high-resolution SAR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The YG-13A mission, launched in late 2015, is the first Chinese synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite to achieve sub-meter resolution. In this paper, we briefly introduce this milestone satellite and describe a method for improving YG-13A's absolute positioning accuracy. We evaluated the plane and three-dimensional absolute positioning accuracy over five test sites. The results indicate that high-accuracy absolute positioning can now be achieved with a horizontal accuracy of 3 m or better for strip-map data and 2 m or better for sliding spot data, without regard to the elevation error. In addition, the three-dimensional absolute positioning accuracy in plane and elevation is within 3 m and 2 m, respectively, which satisfies the requirements for high-precision three-dimensional control points.

AB  - Land cover and land use monitoring, particularly during winter season, is still a major environmental challenge. Indeed, the presence of a vegetation cover, the dates of sowing, the length of the intercrop period, and land use types have an impact on pollutant transport to water bodies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potentiality of polarimetric C- and L-SAR time-series to improve the identification and characterization of vegetation cover during winter season in a 130 km (2) area. Alos-2, Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 time-series were classified using RF algorithm. The best results were obtained from Radarsat-2 polarimetric images acquired between August 2016 and May 2017, with an overall accuracy of similar to 80%.

AB  - Land cover and land use monitoring, particularly during winter season, is still a major environmental and scientific issue in agricultural areas. From an environmental point of view, the presence and type of vegetation cover in winter have an impact on pollutant transport to water bodies. From a methodological point of view, characterizing spatio-temporal dynamics of winter land cover and land use at a field scale remains a challenge due to the diversity of farming strategies and practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of optical and SAR time-series to improve the monitoring of winter land use in an area of 130 km(2). For that purpose, Sentinel-1 and 2 time-series were classified using SVM and RF algorithms. Winter land use was identified with an overall accuracy of 81% and a kappa index of 0.77 from a combination of Sentinel-1 and 2 images.

TI  - Describing temporal variation in reticuloruminal pH using continuous monitoring data
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reticuloruminal pH has been linked to subclinical disease in dairy cattle, leading to considerable interest in identifying pH observations below a given threshold. The relatively recent availability of continuously monitored data from pH boluses gives new opportunities for characterizing the normal patterns of pH over time and distinguishing these from abnormal patterns using more sensitive and specific methods than simple thresholds. We fitted a series of statistical models to continuously monitored data from 93 animals on 13 farms to characterize normal variation within and between animals. We used a subset of the data to relate deviations from the normal pattern to the productivity of 24 dairy cows from a single herd. Our findings show substantial variation in pH characteristics between animals, although animals within the same farm tended to show more consistent patterns. There was strong evidence for a predictable diurnal variation in all animals, and up to 70% of the observed variation in pH could be explained using a simple statistical model. For the 24 animals with available production information, there was also a strong association between productivity (as measured by both milk yield and dry matter intake) and deviations from the expected diurnal pattern of pH 2 d before the productivity observation. In contrast, there was no association between productivity and the occurrence of observations below a threshold pH. We conclude that statistical models can be used to account for a substantial proportion of the observed variability in pH and that future work with continuously monitored pH data should focus on deviations from a predictable pattern rather than the frequency of observations below an arbitrary pH threshold.

AB  - In this paper, the preliminary results on Crop Coefficient (Kc) estimation are presented with the view to assess the crop evapotranspiration in specific cotton fields during the growing season of 2015 and 2016 in Thessaly, Greece. Several World View 2 (WV-2) satellite images were used. The so-called ETcsat (Evapotranspiration from satellite data) produced by using the Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) based on meteorological data and Kc extracted from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) utilizing the Red and Near Infra-Red (NIR) bands. The values of ETcsat are close to Crop Evapotranspiration (ETc) during the cultivation period of cotton and the estimation of ETc is successful. Kc and RedNDVI relationship is based on WV-2 images and water balance in the field scale. The methodology has proved to be very useful for the implementation and verification of any Integrated Management Programme System for optimal agricultural production.

TI  - MONITORING AND PREDICTION OF URBAN EXPANSION USING MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON NEURAL NETWORK BY REMOTE SENSING AND GIS TECHNOLOGIES: A CASE STUDY FROM ISTANBUL METROPOLITAN CITY
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The most significant occurrence in this era is rapid urbanization. Especially in developing countries, the cities have an obvious expansion due to rapid population growth, economic development and infrastructure development initiatives. It is crucial to monitoring and to predict the urban expansion for sustainable cities in terms of settlement planning, transportation, landscaping, etc. At this point, remote sensing data (especially satellite data) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques allow us to get necessary data with high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution. This study aims to detect the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) of the Istanbul Metropolitan City from 2003 to 2016 in purpose of urban expansion by using Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite images in a GIS environment and to predict the status of the city in 2030.The study was carried out in two main steps. In the First step, the LULC changes are detected in Land Change Modeler (LCM) between initial and final dates. This step is very similar to a basic change detection process. The second step is to predict the city statues for a future date. In this step, the results from first step such as classification images are evaluated in a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) approach and then the expansion of the city is predicted. In our case, the change rate of built-up area from 2003 to 2030 is predicted as (+) 48%. The MLP approach allows us to detect the transitions between LULC classes which are very important for city planning. According to results the main transition to built-up area will come from agricultural land. In the end, this study exhibits the advantages of remote sensing and GIS and the importance of urban expansion monitoring in terms of prediction.

AB  - High resolution image time series as those provided by Sentinel-2 allow to target semantically rich nomenclatures for land cover mapping. However, at 10 m resolution, pixel based classification fails to correctly identify some classes for which pixel context is discriminative. Recent advances in deep convolutional neural networks show promising results to tackle this problem, but the lack of complete annotation over large areas, the computational cost and the dimensionality of the feature space (much larger than those used in computer vision) does not allow to use these approaches in operational mapping applications yet. Contextual information can be calculated by applying a fixed-size neighborhood filter, but this can cause the loss of linear objects and the rounding of sharp corners. In Object Based Image Analysis, segmentation is used to extract objects for calculating contextual features while maintaining the high-frequency elements in the image. However, these do not necessarily include spectrally diverse pixels in a neighborhood, which can be relevant for characterizing the context. Superpixels place themselves in between the fixed-neighborhood and the object-based methods, in that they include spectrally diverse pixels in the same segment by imposing size and compacity constraints, while remaining adaptive to the natural boundaries in the image. This study assesses and compares the ability of these three types of neighborhood to improve classification performance on context-dependent classes, in a high-resolution Sentinel-2 time series land cover mapping problem.

A set of tools to control the quality of the 2+1D phase unwrapping, one of the key steps of the proposed procedure, are described and applied over a set of Sentinel-1A (S-1A) images. The results, derived using 64 S1-A images comprising the period from March 2015 to May 2017, are analyzed in the last section of the paper. Finally, the deformation velocity map and the time series are described, in particular over the urban areas, where the proposed approach yields the best results.

AB  - Majuli is the largest inhabited river island in India. It is surrounded by Subansiri on the north, Brahmaputra on the south and a spill channel called Kherkatia Xuti on north east. Majuli has been declared as the 35th district of Assam in May 2017. In other words Majuli is the first river island district in India. Since, time immemorial erosion is a continuous process. Majuli has been facing immense threat due to environmental and social consequences of bank line migration. Erosion have been shrinking its landmass significantly. Along with erosion, other problems that Majuli is facing are flood, breaching of embankments, sand casting, etc. Satellite data are considered as major inputs to this study. This paper enunciates the changes in land area in different years using remote sensing and GIS technology. This has revealed the dramatic change in reduction of land area. The land use land cover area is also shown.

AB  - With the launching of many earth's observation satellites, the amount of data capturing the Earth's surface has been increasing to a great extent. In this paper, we emphasize the need for analyzing the satellite image data particularly in the context of data fusion applied to data taken from sensors of different resolution. The problem lies in maintaining the spectral characteristics of the multispectral images when panchromatic image is used to estimate the high spatial multispectral image. We take a wholesome approach based on the reflectance data irrespective of the sensor physics. The approach aims to produce an enhanced spatial resolution multispectral image having the same resolution as that of the panchromatic data while still preserving the spectral characteristics of the multispectral image. Using a linear regression model between multispectral and panchromatic data, an optimal solution in terms of Lagrange multiplier is provided and validated to maximize the spectral consistency of the fused image. The chi-square test is used to check the "goodness of fit" of the data. The experimental results are discussed and presented using IKONOS satellite data.

AB  - The remote sensing satellites provide complementary images of different resolutions which need to be integrated using the techniques of image fusion. In this paper, image fusion using the IKONOS satellite data is discussed. Unlike other models which are based on sensor model, our approach is data centric including the effects of the sensor as well as the reflectance characteristics of the imaged object. A linear relationship is built between the panchromatic channel and the multispectral channel data. We then formulate a minimisation function in terms of Lagrange multiplier to optimally maximise the spectral consistency and minimise the error in variance. The variances of the downsampled multispectral channels are observed and compared with the original multispectral data. A chi-square goodness of fit test is performed to evaluate the data computed based on our algorithm. Simulation results are presented using the IKONOS 1m resolution panchromatic and 4m resolution multispectral data.

AB  - Network jamming is overpowering a signal transmitter or receiver so the legitimate user cannot receive the data at the destination. Jamming is an attack that is mostly made on the ground level on the satellite network. At this level, it does not concern any connectivity with the uplink channels and downlink channels. Jamming attack makes time delay in satellite networks and user has not received packets at legitimate time.

AB  - The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a naturally occurring phenomenon that involves fluctuating ocean temperature in the equatorial Pacific. ENSO influences ocean climate variability in Indonesia including the Arafura Sea. The relationship between oceanic chlorophylla and ENSO has been the focus of study over the past decade. Here we examine the impact of ENSO on regional chlorophyll-a anomaly in the Papua waters using 14 years of chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature (SST) data from AQUA MODIS and sea level anomaly data from AVISO. It is found that when El Nino events occur the negative SST anomaly in the Papua waters as well as the enhanced upwelling cause the increase of chlorophyll-a concentration. The highest chlorophyll-a concentration (>1 mg.cm(-3)) occured during El Nino and observed around the Aru archipelago. In contrast during La Nina event, the positive SST anomaly in Papua waters and the suppressed upwelling cause the decrease of chlorophyll-a concentration. Our results suggest that during El Nino (La Nina), the enhanced (suppressed) upwelling related to the significant decreasing (increasing) of sea level anomaly.

AB  - Segara Anakan lagoon (SAL) is a dynamic estuary, downstream of several rivers in Citanduy watershed, humid tropical climate and influenced monsoon, conditions that cause waters to fluctuate. There are influence of natural and anthropogenic factors that impact on the increase of aquatic organic matter, as phytoplankton indicator biota able to show its tolerance characterized by fluctuation of chlorophyll content a. The purpose of this research is to know the spatio-temporal distribution of chlorophyll-a SAL region. The chlorophyll-a measurement method uses multitemporal landsat images and field measurements. The temporal approach (time series) during 2016 refers to the monsoon wind pattern and spatially on seven different stations of ecological characteristics. Data processing using ER Mapper 7.0 software and the preparation of thematic data with Arc GIS software. Testing data accuracy using regression analysis. The results of chlorophyll-a recording of landsat images ranged from 3,213 - 3,703 (mg / m(3)) and field measurements from 0.01 to 5.06 (mg / m(3)). Temporally transitional seasons and on spatial approaches, stations with anthropogenic characteristics have the highest chlorophyll content. The condition is supported by the accumulation of aquatic organic materials, high rainfall and upwelling phenomenon. Test of accuracy pertained high, shown with value of r = 0,94 at equation y = -30.07x(2) + 217.0x -387.0, R-2 = 0.894 with regression characteristic is polynomial. The high accuracy value in the equation, shows that the SAL area algorithm can be applied to obtain chlorophyll content data in the field in the previous year with the support of satellite image data in that year.

AB  - Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is a powerful reverse genetic technology used to unravel the functions of genes. It uses viral vectors carrying a fragment of a gene of interest to generate double-stranded RNA, which initiates the silencing of the target gene. The virus vector is used to induce RNA-mediated silencing of a gene or genes in the host plant. A wide range of viruses have been modified for use as VIGS vectors. As the name suggests, VIGS uses the host plant's natural defense mechanisms against viral infection to silence plant genes. VIGS is methodologically simple and is widely used to determine gene functions, including disease resistance, abiotic stress, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and signal transduction pathways. The growing amount of plant genomic and transcriptome data provide a quick way to select important genes for functional analysis. Recently, the VIGS system, besides its ability to silence genes has found an important application in the CRISPR/Cas editing system, a most recent and promising genetic tools for targeted genome editing and precise knocking out of entire genes.

AB  - In aquaculture engineering, estimation of chlorophyll concentration is of utmost importance for water quality monitoring. For a particular area, its concentration is a direct manifestation of the region suitability for fish farming. In literature different parametric and non parametric methods have been studied for chlorophyll concentration prediction. In this paper we have pre-processed the remote sensing data by logarithmic transformation which enhances the data correlation and followed by Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) based forecasting. The proposed methodology is validated on Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWIFS) and the NASA operational Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer onboard AQUA (MODIS-Aqua) data-sets. Experimental result shows the proposed method's efficacy in enhanced accuracy using the projected data.

TI  - Testing the capability of spectral resolution of the new multispectral sensors on detecting the severity of grey leaf spot disease in maize crop
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we tested whether GLS field symptoms on maize can be detected using hyperspectral data re-sampled to WorldView-2, Quickbird, RapidEye and Sentinel-2 resolutions. To achieve this objective, Random Forest algorithm was used to classify the 2013 re-sampled spectra to represent the three identified disease severity categories. Results showed that Sentinel-2, with 13 spectral bands, achieved the highest overall accuracy and kappa value of 84% and 0.76, respectively, while the WorldView-2, with eight spectral bands, yielded the second highest overall accuracy and kappa value of 82% and 0.73, respectively. Results also showed that the 705 and 710nm red edge bands were the most valuable in detecting the GLS for Sentinel-2 and RapidEye, respectively. On the re-sampled WorldView 2 and Quickbird sensor resolutions, the respective 608 and 660nm in the yellow and red bands were identified as the most valuable for discriminating all categories of infection.

TI  - Detecting the severity of maize streak virus infestations in maize crop using <i>in situ</i> hyperspectral data
T2  - Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize streak geminivirus (MSV) causes maize streak disease, a major disease limiting maize production over widespread areas of Africa. There has always been an urgency to develop quick and efficient methods of detecting such a disease for control purposes as well as increased food production and security. The use of remote sensing techniques for detecting the MSV infected maize was evaluated in this study based on experiments in Ofcolaco, Tzaneen, South Africa. Specifically, the potential of hyperspectral data for detecting different levels of MSV infection in maize was tested based on the guided regularized random forest (GRRF) algorithm. The findings of this study illustrate the strength of hyperspectral data in detecting different levels of MSV infection. Specifically, the optimal bands for detecting different levels of maize streak disease in maize were 552 nm, 603 nm, 683 nm, 881 nm and 2338 nm based on the GRRF algorithm. This study underscores the potential of remotely sensed data in the accurate detection of food crop diseases such as MSV and their severity, which is critical in crop monitoring to foster food security especially in the resource-limited sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - Weh Island, Aceh Province, located in the Western-most of Indonesia, is one of the most popular tourism destinations among domestic and international tourists. The tourism sectors in this island might be endangered by nature dynamics that continuously changes to remain balance, either of the noticeable changes is the coastline shape and position alteration. This manuscript aims to examine Weh Island coastline alteration by mapping it through the satellite imageries of Landsat-7 ETM+ of year 2002 and 2009, and Landsat-8 OLI TIRS of year 2015 then calculate the rate by employing DSAS (Digital Shoreline Analysis System) 4.3. The used statistical method, called EPR (End Point Rate), showed that the coastline alteration rate in the area were classified into 5 categories; 1) stable, 2) accretion, 3) low erosion, 4) moderate erosion, and 5) high erosion. In general, Weh Island were encountered erosion for period 2002 - 2009 and accretion for period 2009 - 2015, which distributed over the island. Moreover, the alteration was found around the tourism sites such as Gapang, Iboih and Jaboi coastal area, also Sabang and Balohan port area.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The nickel, chromium, arsenic, cadmium, and lead content have been evaluated, by ICP-MS, in digestive gland of the amphiatlantic gastropod Stramonita haemastoma, sampled along the highly anthropized Gulf of Milazzo (Central Mediterranean). Concentrations notably higher than those reported in literature for other Mediterranean Muricidae have been recorded. The results also indicated a different impact in different sites, according to distribution and typology of human activities, whilst recorded seasonal variations might relate with rapid metabolic response. Such preliminary results suggest S. haemastoma may be considered a promising sentinel species for inorganic contamination in marine environment, especially in terms of short-medium-term exposure.

AB  - Spaceborne sensors allow large areas of the Earth to be monitored with small revisit times; conversely, use of in situ techniques frequently limits spatial and/or temporal coverage of critical infrastructure observations. In this paper, some of the potentialities of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for railway bridge monitoring are explored. The study is focused on a case study regarding a bridge near Triflisco, a small city in Campania, Italy. Twenty-six Cosmo-SkyMed stripmap SAR images were acquired over the area, allowing for a permanent-scatterer (PS) analysis of the bridge structure. Thanks to the availability of a detailed ground truth, the physical nature of the bridge PSs, their spatial distribution, and their time behavior are investigated. In particular, the PS behavior is compared to deformation results obtained using thermal loads in a finite-element model of the bridge.

TI  - The Role of Resolution in the Estimation of Fractal Dimension Maps From SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work is aimed at investigating the role of resolution in fractal dimension map estimation, analyzing the role of the different surface spatial scales involved in the considered estimation process. The study is performed using a data set of actual Cosmo/SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images relevant to two different areas, the region of Bidi in Burkina Faso and the city of Naples in Italy, acquired in stripmap and enhanced spotlight modes. The behavior of fractal dimension maps in the presence of areas with distinctive characteristics from the viewpoint of land-cover and surface features is discussed. Significant differences among the estimated maps are obtained in the presence of fine textural details, which significantly affect the fractal dimension estimation for the higher resolution spotlight images. The obtained results show that if we are interested in obtaining a reliable estimate of the fractal dimension of the observed natural scene, stripmap images should be chosen in view of both economic and computational considerations. In turn, the combination of fractal dimension maps obtained from stripmap and spotlight images can be used to identify areas on the scene presenting non-fractal behavior (e.g., urban areas). Along this guideline, a simple example of stripmap-spotlight data fusion is also presented.

AB  - Ground deformation due to catastrophic natural events have a powerful destructive potential both on people and buildings. In recent years Remote Sensing techniques have proved to be very useful to detect and monitor earth surface and ground deformation phenomena, by helping with their a priori and a posteriori analysis. In particular, Differential SAR Interferometry is widely implemented for such scenarios. In this work, such technique has been applied to observe the effects of the 7.8 Mw earthquake that hit the coast of Ecuador on April 16, 2016. Displacement maps were generated from Sentinel-1 data and compared with the damage reported in the city of Portoviejo, highlighting several critical situations and showing very interesting results. The paper allows to underline the usefulness of using Differential SAR Interferometry and Remote Sensing together with ground truth data comparison. The results so far obtained provide a first base for further evaluations, by using also COSMO-SkyMed imagery, which will represent a valid support for land management authorities.

TI  - Tracking morphological changes and slope instability using spaceborne and ground-based SAR data
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Stromboli (Aeolian Archipelago, Italy) is an active volcano that is frequently affected by moderate to large mass wasting, which has occasionally triggered tsunamis. With the aim of understanding the relationship between the geomorphologic evolution and slope instability of Stromboli, remote sensing information from space-born Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) change detection and interferometry (InSAR) () and Ground Based InSAR (GBInSAR) was compared with field observations and morphological analyses.Ground reflectivity and SqueeSAR (TM) (an InSAR algorithm for surface deformation monitoring) displacement measurements from X-band COSMO-SkyMed satellites (CSK) were analysed together with displacement measurements from a permanent-sited, Ku-band GBInSAR system.Remote sensing results were compared with a preliminary morphological analysis of the Sciara del Fuoco (SdF) steep volcanic flank, which was carried out using a high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Finally, field observations, supported by infrared thermographic surveys (IRT), allowed the interpretation and validation of remote sensing data. The analysis of the entire dataset (collected between January 2010 and December 2014) covers a period characterized by a low intensity of Strombolian activity. This period was punctuated by the occurrence of lava overflows, occurring from the crater terrace evolving downslope toward SdF, and flank eruptions, such as the 2014 event.The amplitude of the CSK images collected between February 22nd, 2010, and December 18th, 2014, highlights that during periods characterized by low-intensity Strombolian activity, the production of materials ejected from the crater terrace towards the SdF is generally low, and erosion is the prevailing process mainly affecting the central sector of the SdF. CSK-SqueeSAR (TM) and GBInSAR data allowed the identification of low displacements in the SdF, except for high displacement rates (up to 1.5 mm/h) that were measured following both lava delta formation after the 2007 eruption and the lava overflows of 2010 and 2011. After the emplacement of the 2014 lava field, high displacements in the central and northern portions of the SdF were recorded by the GBInSAR device, whereas the spaceborne data were unable to detect these rapid movements. A comparison between IRT images and GBInSAR-derived displacement maps acquired during the same time interval revealed that the observed displacements along the SdF were related to the crumbling of newly emplaced 2014 lava and of its external breccia. Detected slope instability after the 2014 flank eruption was related to lava accumulation on the SdF and to the difference in the material underlying the 2014 lava flow: i) lava flows and breccia layers related to the 2002-03 and 2007 lava flow fields in the northern SdF sector and ii) loose volcaniclastic deposits in the central part of the SdF. This work emphasizes the importance of smart integration of spaceborne, SAR-derived hazard information with permanent-sited, operational monitoring by GBInSAR devices to detect areas impacted by mass wasting and volcanic activity.

M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrologic models of wetlands enable water resources managers to quantify the environmental and societal roles of wetlands and manage them in ways that sustain their valuable services. However, reliable wetland models require data that are not typically available from in-situ measurements. In this article, we use satellite information from MODIS (500-meter, 8-day composite land surface reflectance product) and limited ground data to quantify the seasonal and inter-annual changes of wetland extent. This information is used to calibrate a new, non-parametric land cover classification approach. Extensive tests demonstrate that the new approach performs well in (i) classifying accurately land cover classes and (ii) delineating reliably seasonal and inter-annual wetland area changes. The new approach is applied to the Sudd wetland in South Sudan, a vast wetland of vital socioeconomic and environmental services, toward developing better, policy-relevant information and tools.

TI  - Mandatory multidisciplinary approach for the evaluation of the lymph node status in rectal cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF MIND AND MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Colorectal cancer is the third most frequently reported malignancy and also the third leading cancer-related cause of death worldwide. Lymph node evaluation, both preoperatively and postoperatively, represents an important aspect of the diagnosis and therapeutic strategy in colorectal cancer, such that an accurate preoperative staging is required for a correct therapeutic strategy. Treatment of rectal cancer with positive lymph nodes, a very important predictive prognostic parameter, is currently based on neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by total/surgical mesorectal excision and adjuvant regimen.Preoperative evaluation of the lymph node status in rectal cancer is based on endoscopic ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, but their accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity still require improvement. Postoperative evaluation also presents points of debate, especially related to the role of sentinel lymph node mapping and their final implication, represented by detection of micrometastases and isolated tumor cells. The pathologic interpretation of tumor deposits represents other points in discussion. From a surgical perspective, extended lateral lymph node dissection vs. abstinence and (neo) adjuvant therapeutic approach represent another unresolved issue.This review presents the major controversies existing today in the treatment and pathologic interpretation of the lymph nodes in rectal cancer, the role/indication and value of the lateral pelvic lymph node dissection, and the postoperative interpretation of the value of the micrometastatic disease and tumor deposits.

TI  - Risk Factors Associated with Dengue Transmission and Spatial Distribution of High Seroprevalence in Schoolchildren from the Urban Area of Medellin, Colombia
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES & MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue fever is an increasing health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. During 2010 in Medellin, the younger population presented a particularly high dengue incidence rate. This study estimated dengue virus (DENY) transmission in schoolchildren (aged 5-19 years) in Medellin from 2010 to 2012. A longitudinal serological survey (IgG) and spatial analysis were conducted to determine the distribution of DENY seroprevalence. A total of 4,385 schoolchildren participated for at least one year. Dengue seroprevalence significantly increased during the studied period (53.8% to 64.6%; p < 0.001). A significantly higher seroconversion rate was observed in 2010-2011 (16.8%) compared to 2011-2012 (7.8%). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the main factor associated with the seroprevalence was the aging. Furthermore, in 2010, patients with high socioeconomic status presented a lower risk. Predominant multitypic and DENV4 monotypic antibody responses were demonstrated. Geostatistical analysis evidenced a temporal clustering distribution of DENY seroprevalence in 2010. Population density and Ae. aegypti House Index were significantly correlated with the observed pattern. This study revealed high DENY transmission in schoolchildren determined as "sentinel population." High DENV risk was found in districts with combined poorly socioeconomic conditions and densest human and mosquito populations. These findings may allow to target population for effective prevention and vaccination campaigns.

AB  - In this paper, a novel framework for aircraft detection in high resolution apron area in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is proposed, which combines the strength of location regression based convolutional neural network (CNN) framework and the salient features of target in SAR images. Specifically, a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) based target pre-locating algorithm is introduced, which can match the scale of target in SAR images more accurate compared to the existing region proposal method. In addition, in order to eliminate the fact of overfitting, we explore several strategies for SAR data augmentation, including translation, adding noise and rotation within a small range. Experiments are conducted on the data set acquired by the TerraSAR-X satellite in a resolution of 3.0 meters. The results show that the proposed detection framework could effectively obtain a more accurate detection result.

AB  - The Macaronesia islands (Canary and Cape Verde archipelagos) have experienced intense seismic and volcanic activity that may in the near future put in risk people and goods. It is important to implement measurement strategies to monitor the seismic activity and the surface deformation. Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (SAR) has proven to be a useful technique to monitor the surface deformation in wide and remote areas, warning pre-eruption displacements and large-scale mass-wasting, so helping civil protection authorities. In this project, we investigate the applicability of SAR Interferometry (InSAR) for long time deformation monitoring in La Palma and Tenerife (Canary archipelago) and Fogo islands (Cape Verde archipelago). We have applied the advanced interferometric SAR processing based on Persistent Scatterers (PS). The small number of manmade structures on the volcanic areas reduces the density of Persistent Scatterers. Furthermore, the different ascending and descending acquisition geometries give different sets of PSs, with complementary spatial coverage and different line-of sight velocities. The strategy used to overcome the aforementioned problem is based on the combination of 3D GPS velocities with two sets of PS determined from ascending and descending passes. A data set of hundreds of SAR images acquired by Sentinel-1 were interferometrically processed and two sets of PSs, determined from ascending and descending passes, were computed for each island. The images were acquired between 2015 and 2018. In each island, the two PS datasets, were combined to derive the vertical deformation map and further be calibrated with GNSS velocities provided by EUREF continuous operating GNSS stations. The results are analysed and compared with previous results and studies of DInSAR techniques and GPS campaigns. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Quantification of Two-Dimensional Wave Breaking Dissipation in the Surf Zone from Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for obtaining two dimensional fields of wave breaking energy dissipation in the surfzone is presented. The method relies on acquiring geometrical parameters of the wave roller from remote sensing data. These parameters are then coupled with a dissipation model to obtain time averaged two dimensional maps, but also the wave breaking energy dissipation on a wave-by-wave basis. Comparison of dissipation maps as obtained from the present technique and a results from a numerical model, show very good correlation in both structure and magnitude. The location of a rip current can also be observed from the field data. Though in the present work a combination of optical and microwave data is used, the underlying method is independent of the remote sensor platform. Therefore, it offers the possibility to acquire high quality and synoptic estimates that could contribute to the understanding of the surfzone hydrodynamics.

T2  - M+A-REVISTA ELECTRONICA DE MEDIO AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the beginning of the 21st century Uruguay is witnessing a process of agrarian intensification. To assess the impacts of this processes crucial to understand the temporal and spatial behaviour of the intensification, and the functioning of the environmental system; both reported by a synthesis variable. The objective of this work was to define a methodology for the spatio-temporal evaluation of the intensification process, and its incidence on the above net primary productivity (ANPP). The research strategy considered the definition of a land use intensity index, and the analysis of the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). Results showed that 80% of the rural area has been intensified. Also, that the NDVI trend decreased in areas with high land use intensity and increased in areas with low land use intensity. Finally, it is important to highlight the negative impact of the intensification on the environmental systems.

TI  - Exploring the Relationship between Secularity and Marital Behavior
T2  - MARRIAGE AND FAMILY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The higher religiosity of women is a longstanding feature of the religious landscape in the Western World. With the recent vibrancy of secular movements, the greater religiosity of women is reflected in a gender imbalance within the secular groups. For instance, more than three quarters of American atheists are male. Given the effects of both religiosity and secularity on worldview and lifestyle, this gender imbalance is likely consequential for marital behavior and outcomes. Using the latest cycle of the Canadian General Social Survey focused on family, this paper examines how marital behavior of individuals without any tie with religion or spirituality compares with others. Secular males are found appreciably more likely to experience marital dissolution, whereas their female counterparts are shown no different from others. This result lends support to the theories that posit religiosity as a complementary marital trait, requiring the mating of the like. The analysis also indicates that union formation behavior of secular females manifests a larger shift away from the traditional conceptions of marriage compared with secular males. Various explanations are explored.

TI  - Day by day evolution of a vigorous two wave Saharan dust storm - Thermal and air quality impacts
T2  - ATMOSFERA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper conducts a day-by-day analysis of an intense Saharan dust storm that struck Athens (Greece) during April 2008 and consisted of two main dust waves (the first from 10/04/2008 to 14/04/2008 and the second from 19/04/2008 to 22/04/2008). Daily satellite data (1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution) of aerosol optical depth (AOD) were used, in order to follow the course of two dust plumes originated in North Africa through the eastern Mediterranean. Ground based measurements of particle concentrations (PM10 and PM2.5) and meteorological parameters (wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity and visibility) were also studied. The time intervals before and after each dust wave were taken under consideration, aiming to identify the atmospheric circulation that generated the dust storm and also the clearing mechanisms that removed the African dust from the Athenian atmosphere. Backward air mass trajectories isolated the source of the two dust plumes over Libya and Tunisia, where extreme daily AOD values were recorded. The transportation of dust in the Greek region, during both dust waves, was associated with south westerlies airflows attributed to the advent of low pressure systems from the Atlantic. The impact of both dust waves in Athens was interrupted by the prevalence of a strong north westerlies air stream, which carried the particles eastwards through Turkey, Cyprus and the Middle East. During this dust event, air quality in Athens was severely downgraded, but no thermal discomfort has occurred, according to the estimation of a Pollution Index (PI) and a Discomfort Index (DI), respectively. A drop in visibility was also reported.

TI  - ESTIMATING BIOMASS AND CARBON STORAGE OF GRASSLANDS USING VERY HIGH-RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGES IN THE CORUH RIVER BASIN (NORTHEASTERN TURKEY)
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Coruh River basin predominantly characterized by its vast grasslands and by potential biodiversity richness due to its climatic and topographic variation throughout the basin. Despite its well-known ecological importance, there is not much work conducted in the basin that deals with the estimation of biomass and carbon storage of the grassland. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate belowground biomass (BGB), aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon sequestration in the grasslands of 11 sub-basins within the Coruh River Basin using very high-resolution (0.5 m) WorldView-2 satellite imagery and meteorological data. For BGB and AGB estimations, 1196 soil root samples and 49 harvested biomass (wire cage) samples, respectively, were collected from total of 299 sampling plots. The mean AGB and BGB in the sampling plots were estimated to be 1.58 t ha(-1) and 4.02 t ha(-1), respectively. As a result, mean total biomass (TB) calculated as 5.60 t ha(-1) in the entire study areas. The mean TB values showed significant differences among the sub-basins (p<0.05). It was also found that 76% of TB contributed by the belowground while the rest was from the aboveground biomass. In terms of carbon storage, mean aboveground carbon (AGC), belowground carbon (BGC) and total carbon (TC) were calculated to be 0.79, 2.01 and 2.80 t ha(-1), respectively. The results showed that both TB and TC were the highest in Bicakcilar sub-basin while they were the lowest in Tortum sub-basin. In conclusion, the study showed that biomass and carbon storage of the grasslands can be successfully mapped for a large basin by utilizing the remote sensing tools and with the help other ecological factors. Planners and land-owners can use the base-maps of the present study in their decision making processes and their field management, as well.

AB  - The discriminant cut is used to segment the oil spills in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed approach is a region-based one, which is able to capture and utilize spatial information in SAR images. The real SAR images, i.e. ALOS-1 PALSAR and Sentinel-1 SAR images were collected and used to validate the accuracy of the proposed approach for oil spill segmentation in SAR images. The accuracy of the proposed approach is higher than that of the fuzzy C-means classification method.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Ho Chi Minh City, VIETNAM
AB  - In remote sensing image analysis, the accuracy of the results depends not only on the accuracy of the image acquisition process but also on the segmentation and classification accuracy of the image. The fuzzy classification technique works by dividing the pixels of the image into sets of fuzzy clusters by iteratively optimizing the objective function to update the cluster membership and center centroid. This technique overcomes the disadvantages of hard clustering; However, this method is quite sensitive to interference and extraneous elements. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised clustering method with spatial weights (SPFCM-W) for multi-spectral remote sensing image land-cover classification by the extension of the possibilistic fuzzy c-means (PFCM) algorithm, in which spatial weights of the pixels and labeled data are used to increase the accuracy of clustering results when the data structure of input patterns is non-spherical and complex. Results obtained on two kinds of multi-spectral remote sensing images (Landsat-7 ETM+, Sentinel-2A) by comparing the proposed technique with some variations of the fuzzy clustering algorithm demonstrate the good efficiency and high accuracy of the proposed method.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: in the article we refer to the late creative work of Yu. Shestalov, which differs from previously published works by unexpected insights, philosophical ideas, cosmic vision of the world, and his hypotheses and poetic insights fascinate by their etymological explanations. The object of the research are the works created after 1990-ies: "The Consciousness of the Torum, the Consciousness of Nature Are the Path to Salvation", "The Cosmic Vision of the World on the Boundaries of the Millennia" (2002), "The Shamanic Mysteries of Revelation of the Word "Rus" (2011). The subject of the analysis is the philosophical problematics of the works.Objective: to research the philosophical problematics in the works of Yu. Shestalov in the context of the traditional worldview of the Mansi people.Research materials: the collections of Yu. Shestalov published after 1990-ies. The work uses holistic, structural-systemic, structural-semantic and fragmentary analyses of literary text.Results and novelty of the research: the relevance of the research is determined by the fact that the philosophical problematics of the works ofYu. Shestalov have not been previously investigated in literature. The scientific novelty lies in the fact that the study of philosophical insights, worldview searches of the writer is carried out in comparison with the works of famous poets of thought: F. I. Tyutchev and N. A. Zabolotsky as well as the philosophical and religious conception of the writer is studied in the context of the traditional culture of the Mansi people.We come to the conclusion that after the 1990-ies Yu. Shestalov finds an original approach to the study of the spiritual and cultural heritage of the Mansi people; his work takes the form of prayers, spells, revelations, insights, thanks. The writer begins to realize his special spiritual mission towards his ethnos and all mankind. He thinks about many eternal and immortal philosophical problems: surrounding world, life, the Cosmos, a human and the sense of his existence in the world. His insights reflect the contradictions of time and searches of their resolving, traditional system of values and anxiety about the global environmental consequences of insane attitude to nature by humans. The writer encourages people to spiritual self-purification, calling them the unique creations of the unique planet; he encourages people to be thinkers.

TI  - DESIGN AND TESTING OF A BOOM SPRAYER PROTOTYPE TO RELEASE <i>TRICHOGRAMMA OSTRINIAE</i> (HYMENOPTERA: TRICHOGRAMMATIDAE) IN SWEET CORN FOR BIOCONTROL OF <i>OSTRINIA NUBILALIS</i> (HUBNER) (LEPIDOPTERA: CRAMBIDAE)
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sweet corn requires many insecticide applications to control its main pest: the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). The use of Trichogramma is an effective biological alternative to control the European corn borer in sweet corn. However, manual introduction at large scale of Trichogramma using Trichocards is time-consuming. Mechanized infroduction of Trichogramma using a boom sprayer is an innovative and advantageous solution. The objective of this study was to design and test a boom sprayer to spray Trichogramma ostriniae (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) in sweet corn canopy under real field conditions. Trichogramma ostriniae parasitized eggs were sprayed at a rate of 800,000 individuals ha(-1) using a boom sprayer designed at the Department of Soils and Agri-Food Engineering of Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada. Trichogramma parasitized eggs were also introduced at a rate of 500,000 individuals ha(-1) using Trichocards. Overall, eight releases were made during the 2016 season. Field trial results showed a 17.22% emergence rate reduction of Trichogramma in the sprayed plots compared to Trichocards. Total fecundity and longevity of sprayed T. ostriniae females were not negatively affected by spraying; indicating that spraying did not have any negative impact on their quality. The parasitism rates observed on natural egg masses of O. nubilalis and on sentinel egg masses of Ephestia kuehniella were comparable for both methods. At harvest, sprayed and Trichocards treatments resulted in adequate control of the European corn borer. Obtained results also showed that spraying was 1.7 times faster than the manual infroduction of Trichocards. Overall, the results indicate that spraying is a promising technique for an efficient and viable infroduction of Trichogramma parasitized eggs. However, more research is recommended to further optimize the spraying parameters. The spraying system successfully used in sweet corn could also be used in corn production and adapted to other crops such as pepper, beans, and potatoes to control the European corn borer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children <5 years of age in developing countries, with rotavirus being the most common infectious etiology. In November 2014, monovalent rotavirus vaccine was introduced in Senegal. We determined the impact of rotavirus vaccine on hospitalizations for all-cause and rotavirus related AGE in children <60 months of age.METHODS: We examined two data sources from the national referral hospital. Using sentinel surveillance data from March 2011 to February 2017, we examined the proportion of AGE hospitalizations among children <60 months of age attributable to rotavirus, stratified by age groups (0-11, 12-23 and 24-59 months). Using pediatric logbook data from March 2010 to February 2017, we examined the proportion of all childhood hospitalizations attributable to AGE, among the same age groups.RESULTS: In sentinel surveillance, 673 patients <60 months were hospitalized for AGE, with 30% (203/673) due to rotavirus. In pre-vaccine years, the median proportion of rotavirus-positive hospitalizations was 42%; this proportion declined by 76% to 10% rotavirus positive in 2015-2016 (p < .001) and by 59% to 17% in 2016-2017 (p < .001). From the logbook data, among all children <60 months, a median of 11% of all hospitalizations in the pre-vaccine period were due to AGE, with 2015-2016 seeing a 16% decline (p < .001), to 9% of all hospitalizations, and 2016-2017 seeing a 39% decline (p < .001), to 7% of all hospitalizations. Declines in both rotavirus-associated and all-cause AGE hospitalizations were most marked among infants, with a suggestion of herd effect among older children seen in the surveillance data.CONCLUSION: Rotavirus vaccine demonstrated a significant impact on rotavirus-associated hospitalizations and all-cause AGE hospitalizations in the first two seasons after vaccine introduction in Senegal. Our data support the continued use of this vaccine in national immunization program.

TI  - Using Real-Time Syndromic Surveillance to Analyze the Impact of a Cold Weather Event in New Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. This report describes the development of a novel syndromic cold weather syndrome for use in monitoring the impact of cold weather events on emergency department attendance. Methods. Syndromic messages from seven hospitals were analyzed for ED visits that occurred over a 12-day period. A cold weather syndrome was defined using terms in the self-reported chief complaint field as well as specific ICD-10-CM codes related to cold weather. A kappa statistic was calculated to assess the overall agreement between the chief complaint field and diagnosis fields to further refine the cold weather syndrome definition. Results. Of the 3,873 ED visits that were reported, 487 were related to the cold weather event. Sixty-three percent were identified by a combination of diagnosis codes and chief complaints. Overall agreement between chief complaint and diagnosis codes was moderate (kappa = 0.50; 95% confidence interval = 0.48-0.52). Conclusion. Due to the near real-time reporting of syndromic surveillance data, analysis results can be acted upon. Results from this analysis will be used in the state's emergency operations plan (EOP) for cold weather and winter storms. The EOP will provide guidance for mobilization of supplies/personnel, preparation of roadways and pedestrian walkways, and the coordination efforts of multiple state agencies.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 5th Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering and Soil Dynamics Conference (GEESD)
CL  - Austin, TX
AB  - Indian cities are growing at a faster rate due to urban sprawl and urban dynamics. Delhi is one of the seismic hazard-prone cities in the world located next to the Himalayan range, home of nearly eighteen million. Construction of high rise buildings even in the hazard-prone areas has become common due to high population intensity in major Indian cities. Damages to the livelihood and lives happen only when earthquakes interact with infrastructures and population. This study presents the details of the deterministic seismic hazard analysis (DSHA) of Delhi considering latest available information of seismic events and sources, within a distance of 500 km radius from the outermost boundaries of the city. Earthquake data catalog for the study region was developed by collecting seismic data from various agencies. Seismic event magnitudes were converted into a homogenized unified moment magnitude scale. A seismotectonic map for the study region was developed by superimposing the declustered earthquake event on the seismic source map of the region. The study area was divided into grids of size 0.02 degrees x0.02 degrees and DSHA was performed using attenuation relationship available for the active tectonic region. Peak ground acceleration (PGA) values were evaluated for 84th percentile values at the center of each of the grid points. Land use (LU) map for the study region was also generated using Landsat8 data. Hazard contour map, ward-wise administrative map, and LU map for the year 2016 are presented in this paper to revisit the seismic risk prevailing in the region.

TI  - Decadal analysis of impact of future climate on wheat production in dry Mediterranean environment: A case of Jordan
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Different aspects of climate change, such as increased temperature, changed rainfall and higher atmospheric CO2 concentration, all have different effects on crop yields. Process-based crop models are the most widely used tools for estimating future crop yield responses to climate change. We applied APSIM crop simulation model in a dry Mediterranean climate with Jordan as sentinel site to assess impact of climate change on wheat production at decadal level considering two climate change scenarios of representative concentration pathways (RCP) viz., RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Impact of climatic variables alone was negative on grain yield but this adverse effect was negated when elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations were also considered in the simulations. Crop cycle of wheat was reduced by a fortnight for RCP4.5 scenario and by a month for RCP8.5 scenario at the approach of end of the century. On an average, a grain yield increase of 5 to 11% in near future i.e., 2010s-2030s decades, 12 to 16% inmid future i.e., 2040s-2060s decades and 9 to 16% in end of century period can be expected for moderate climate change scenario (RCP4.5) and 6 to 15% in near future, 13 to 19% in mid future and 7 to 20% increase in end of century period for a drastic climate change scenario (RCP8.5) based on different soils. Positive impact of elevated CO2 is more pronounced in soils with lower water holding capacity with moderate increase in temperatures. Elevated CO2 had greater positive effect on transpiration use efficiency (TUE) than negative effect of elevated mean temperatures. The change in TUE was in near perfect direct relationship with elevated CO2 levels (R-2 > 0.99) and every 100-pp matmospheric CO2 increase resulted in TUE increase by 2 kg ha(-1) mm(-1). Thereby, in this environment yield gains are expected in future and farmers can benefit from growing wheat. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - This abstract proposes a method to enhance the classification of high spatial remotely sensed imagery by using Multiband Compact Texture Unit (MBCTU) descriptor and pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) feature extractor. MBCTU was used in order to take into account intra-and interband spatial interactions by characterizing texture using relative pixel values in a multispectral neighborhood instead of a monoband neighborhood. The derived new encoded images are fed to a deep feature extractor (fine-tuned CNN). Finally, the obtained deep features are classified using k nearest neighbor's (KNN) algorithm to produce the classification map. The proposed approach is applied to the classification of hyperspectral and multispectral datasets. Results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve accurate classification results compared to other approaches using the full spectral dataset.

TI  - Using panel survey and remote sensing data to explain yield gaps for maize in sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to combine remote sensing data with geo-coded household survey data in order to measure the impact of different socioeconomic and biophysical factors on maize yields. We use multilevel linear regression to model village mean maize yield per year as a function of NDVI, commercialization, pluriactivity and distance to market. We draw on seven years of panel data on African smallholders, drawn from three rounds of data collection over a twelve-year period and 56 villages in six countries combined with a time-series analysis of NDVI data from the MODIS sensor. We show that, although there is much noise in yield forecasts as made with our methodology, socio-economic drivers substantially impact on yields, more, it seems, than do biophysical drivers. To reach more powerful explanations researchers need to incorporate socioeconomic parameters in their models.

TI  - Beach Evolution Adjacent to a Seasonally Varying Tidal Inlet in Central Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cua Dai Inlet is a typical, seasonally varying tidal inlet in central Vietnam. Since 1995 the northern adjacent coast, known as Cua Dai Beach, has experienced serious erosion. The decadal scale behavior of this inlet appears to reflect a nonperiodic cyclic process. Inlet channel shifting from north to south has welded the abandoned ebb-tidal delta with Cua Dai Beach, leading to accretion but subsequently triggering erosion. Although erosion of Cua Dai Beach was exacerbated by decrease of sediment supply from the estuary and ebb-tidal delta and by coastal developments, the channel shifting to the south, and the ebb shoal development were important primary controlling mechanisms. This study aims to quantify the main erosional processes in and near the Cua Dai coastal inlet and adjacent beaches since 1995. First, satellite data were used to detect shoreline change trends and to estimate volume changes. Second, alongshore, wave-driven sediment transports were estimated using numerical models. Observed shoreline changes indicate that, during the period from 2000 to 2010, erosion rates at the northern side of the inlet were on average 12 m/y. Close to the inlet, erosion rates were larger, up to 19 m/y. At the same time, the southern coast of the inlet was found to accrete with a mean rate of 11 m/y. Calculated alongshore sediment transport rates explain the observed erosion and accretion patterns. The overall system lost a significant sediment volume, which is estimated to amount to 243,000-310,000 m(3)/y. A logical conclusion is that the effects of the shifting of the inlet channel to the south caused erosion of the northern adjacent coast, whereas human interventions in the river catchment, the estuary, and along the coast contributed importantly to the overall sediment deficit of the inlet system and its beaches and to the shifting erosion pattern toward the north.

TI  - The relationship between the social memory and sociocognition: in search of the social context in the Knowledge Organization
T2  - EM QUESTAO
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to highlight the relation between social memory and social cognition and the perspectives of understanding the context for knowledge organization. The research is exploratory and adopts as a methodological procedure the bibliographic research. It understands social memory as a source of knowledge that presupposes the collective experience of a group. The sociocognition, the studies on the language and the discussions that this field contemplates from the perspective of the paradigm of the social cognition are characterized. It points to the intersection between social memory and sociocognition, at the point where, for the interpretation of memory, it is necessary to understand its context, which has the sociocognitive characteristics of its interlocutors, that is, the worldview of the interpreter. The field of sociocognitive discursive memory as the framework where the socio-communicative practices of representation and memory are constituted is elucidated. The study shows that the questions about the discourse, the contexts of use, the communicative and social intentions made by the speakers are elements of study in the field of sociocognitive discursive memory. Notes that the basis indicated by sociocognition for the study of social memory provides the basis for the organization of knowledge with respect to the ways in which discursive communities produce and organize their socially constructed knowledge.

TI  - Differential accumulation of proteins in oil palms affected by fatal yellowing disease
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - There is still no consensus on the true origin of fatal yellowing, one of the most important diseases affecting oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) plantations. This study involved two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (2D-UPLC-MSE) analyses to identify changes in protein profiles of oil palms affected by FY disease. Oil palm roots were sampled from two growing areas. Differential accumulation of proteins was assessed by comparing plants with and without symptoms and between plants at different stages of FY development. Most of the proteins identified with differential accumulation were those related to stress response and energy metabolism. The latter proteins include the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, related to alcohol fermentation, which were identified in plants with and without symptoms. The presence of these enzymes suggests an anaerobic condition before or during FY. Transketolase, isoflavone reductase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine synthase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and ferritin, among others, were identified as potential marker proteins and could be used to guide selection of FY-tolerant oil palm genotypes or to understand the source of this anomaly. When comparing different stages of FY, we observed high accumulation of alcohol dehydrogenase and other abiotic stress related-proteins at all disease stages. On the other hand, biological stress-related proteins were more accumulated at later stages of the disease. These results suggest that changes in abiotic factors can trigger FY development, creating conditions for the establishment of opportunistic pathogens. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - CHILDREN AND JUVENILE LITERATURE OF THE THIRD REICH AS AN INSTRUMENT OF NAZI IDENTITY FORMATION
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the role of children and juvenile literature of the Third Reich in the development of Nazi identity. In German culture of the 1930s, the image of childhood developed during the period of the Weimar Republic underwent dramatic changes. As the Third Reich was proclaimed "the Youth Reich" (das jugendliche Reich), childhood lost its autonomy and merged with "youth," the key concept of the Nazi era. Youth, in turn, was more than age category; it implied a certain worldview, or a specific life position that all age groups of Nazi society had to adhere to. Children and adolescents aged 10-18 years old joined the Hitler Youth, the largest organization in the world, and became carriers of the new ideology. Literature for children and adolescents of the Third Reich significantly expanded its boundaries: now it included literary works written for adults, and also those written before 1933. "Expanded borders," therefore, implied multiple cases of intersection between children and adult literature, interpenetration and coexistence of these literatures within the cultural ambience of the Nazi period. Despite the tact that the entire system of education and upbringing fostered indoctrination while literature was one but not the only one factor in the development of the new identity in this multilevel system, it was literature that legitimized children's refusal to follow their personal interests and encouraged their engagement in the propagated ideological system.

TI  - Is This Stone Alive? Prefiguring the Future Role of Archaeology
T2  - NORWEGIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - By reflecting on new and emerging perspectives and trends in the contemporary humanities and social sciences, including the critique of anthropocentrism, Eurocentrism and secularism, the questioning of human epistemic authority over knowledge building, the indigenization of the academy', and debates over the applicability of the humanities to the problems of the contemporary world, the author identifies tendencies that are relevant to discussions on the future role of archaeology. In her analysis of the ontological and animist/ic turns, the author claims that asking the questions what is an object?' and is it alive?' within the context of this paradigm shift might support the emergence of an alternative worldview based on a participatory perspective of the world that understands (new) animism as a different way of being human and relating to the world on different terms. The author asks whether it is possible for archaeology (as the discipline of animated bones and things') to potentially become an intellectual platform for exercising an alternative worldview.

TI  - Patterns of axillary evaluation in older patients with breast cancer and associations with adjuvant therapy receipt
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although axillary lymph node status has traditionally been a key factor in informing adjuvant breast cancer therapy recommendations, this information may be less relevant as our focus shifts more towards tumor biology, particularly in older patients where comorbidity influences treatment decisions and nodal staging and/or surgery may not improve outcomes. We examined patterns of axillary surgery and associations between axillary surgery and receipt of adjuvant treatment in older breast cancer patients.Women aged >= 65 years with clinically node-negative, stage I-II breast cancer treated between 2012 and 2013 were identified using the National Cancer Data Base. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined associations between axillary surgery and age, adjusting for patient, clinical, and facility factors. We also examined receipt of adjuvant treatment by nodal surgery.Among 68,205 women, 40.1% were aged 65-70, 24.5% were 71-75, 17.4% were 76-80, and 18.0% were > 80. Overall, 91.2% had axillary surgery (67.8% sentinel lymph node biopsy, 11.7% axillary lymph node dissection, 11.7% unspecified/unknown axillary surgery); 88.0% of those aged >= 70 with lower risk, hormone receptor-positive tumors underwent axillary surgery. In adjusted analyses, compared to patients aged 65-70, increasing age was associated with lower odds of any axillary surgery (ages 71-75: OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57-0.71; ages 76-80: OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.30-0.37; age > 80: OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.07-0.08). Axillary surgery was associated with higher odds of receipt of radiation after breast conservation and receipt of chemotherapy in human epidermal growth factor 2-positive disease.In a large nationwide dataset, the vast majority of older women with clinically node-negative breast cancer underwent axillary staging despite uncertainty about its impact on survival, particularly for those with lower-risk disease. Further study on how to tailor node assessment in older patients is warranted.

TI  - Factors predicting non-sentinel lymph node status in breast cancer patients with 1-2 macrometastatic positive sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate predicting factors and to develop a predictive nomogram for non-sentinel lymph nodes (non-SLNs) metastases in breast cancer patients with 1-2 macrometastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Details of clinical, imaging, and pathological features of 374 breast cancer patients with 1-2 SLNs metastases, between January 2010 and June 2015, that underwent sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB) and complete axillary lymph node dissections (ALND) were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the predicting factors of non-SLNs metastases of these patients. A nomogram was created with these independent predictors. Afterward, the model was applied to 135 breast cancer patients with 1-2 SLNs metastases between July 2015 and December 2016. According to results of multivariate analysis, abnormal sonographic ALNs, perineural invasion, clinical TNM staging (cTNM), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), Ki67, and ratio of metastatic SLNs to total SLNs (pRatio) were identified as independent predictors of non-SLNs metastasis. The nomogram for the modeling population was precise and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.741 (95% CI: 0.693-0.785). When applied to the validation population, the model predicted non-SLNs status effectively (ROC = 0.763, 95% CI: 0.682-0.832). The nomogram developed may distinguish patients with low risk for positive non-SLNs from high risk patients effectively. It could help surgeons and patients to make decisions on avoidance of ALND surgery for low risk of non-SLNs metastases.

AB  - Based on the medium resolution Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, the temperature distribution in four seasons of urban area in Jinan City was obtained by using atmospheric correction method for the retrieval of land surface temperature. Quantitative analysis of the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics, development trend of urban thermal environment, the seasonal variation and the relationship between surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was studied. The results show that the distribution of high temperature areas is concentrated in Jinan, and there is a tendency to expand from east to west, revealing a negative correlation between land surface temperature distribution and NDVI. So as to provide theoretical references and scientific basis of improving the ecological environment of Jinan City, strengthening scientific planning and making overall plan addressing climate change.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Xinmo landslide occurred in the early morning of 24 June 2017 at about 5: 38 am local time. This catastrophic event caused enormous casualties and huge economic losses in Xinmo Village, Mao County, Sichuan Province, China. In this study, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets acquired by X-band TerraSAR-X, Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) aboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2), and C-band Sentinel-1 over the disaster area were collected and analyzed to characterize this landslide. The high-resolution TerraSAR-X intensity images were used to evaluate the landslide disaster and delineate the sliding area. Afterwards, two ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 image pairs and a stack of 45 Sentinel-1 images were processed to detect precursory movements of the landslide surface, using the conventional differential InSAR (DInSAR) method and advanced time series InSAR analysis. The unstable source area near the ridge was identified from the displacement rate map derived from Sentinel-1 datasets. The maximum displacement rate detected at the source area was -35mm/year along the radar line of sight (LOS) direction. The time series of LOS displacements over 2 years presents an easily discerned seasonal evolution pattern. In particular, a sudden acceleration of the displacement, dozens of days before the collapse was clearly captured by the Sentinel-1 observations, which might suggest that early warning of landslide disasters is possible given the availability of operational SAR data acquired in frequent repeat-pass mode, such as the Sentinel-1 twin-satellite constellation.

TI  - The Dynamical Linkage of Atmospheric Blocking to Drought, Heatwave and Urban Heat Island in Southeastern US: A Multi-Scale Case Study
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric blocking is a long standing structure stalled in the mid-troposphere which is often associated with extreme weather events such as droughts, heatwaves, flood and cold air outbreak. A striking atmospheric blocking is identified to persist over the US during 13-17 August 2007, exacerbating the existing drought over the Southeastern US. This pronounced blocking event not only intensified the concurrent drought conditions, but also led to a record-breaking heatwave over the Southeast of the US. The excessive heat observed during this heatwave is attributable to the subsidence-associated adiabatic warming as well as the dry-and-warm air advection over Alabama and the neighboring states. At the local scale, we choose Birmingham, AL, as the study area for exploring the blocking influence on urban heat island. Based on the remote sensing data, the surface (skin) urban heat island is found to be 8 C in this area on the block-onset day. This provides partial evidences that the surface urban heat island intensity is likely amplified by the blocking-induced heat waves. The present work provides a unique case study in which blocking, drought, heatwave and urban heat island all occur concurrently, and interplay across a spectrum of spatial scales. We conclude that atmospheric blocking is capable of reinforcing droughts, initiating heatwaves, and probably amplifying the urban heat island intensity during the concurrent period.

TI  - High risk for non-sentinel node metastasis in breast cancer patients with sentinel node metastases
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To identify the risk factor of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis in order to better guide the decision regarding axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive sentinel node metastases. Methods: A total of 215 patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) who underwent ALND at Department of Breast at the Women's Hospital were reviewed. Independent clinicopathological factors predicting the non-SLN metastasis were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. A risk score was established to predict the non-SLN metastasis. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that increasing tumor size, presence of lymphovascular invasion, HER2 positivity were independent predictors of non-SLN metastasis. Besides, absent of negative SLNs was also an independent risk factor of non-SLN metastasis. Eighty-seven (40.5%) patients had non-SLN metastasis when 1-2 SLNs were positive. Thirty-three (15.3%) patients were classified as high risk of non-NSN metastasis according to the risk score, among which, there were 30 patients (90.9%) with non-SLN metastasis. Conclusion: ALND is beneficial in patients who met eligible for Z0011 criteria but at high risk of non-SLN involvement.

AB  - The Loess covered areas include Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Gansu and other provinces and is the main coal production base. The Loess Plateau is characterized by varied topography, complicated geological and geomorphic conditions and large thickness of mining coal seam, which results in many types of geological hazards, wide distribution and great threat. Therefore, it is very necessary to monitor the surface deformation by full coverage and all-weather monitoring. The vertical deformation information with high accuracy can be obtained by using D-InSAR technology. Compared with the traditional monitoring method, it has the advantages of high resolution, high coverage, all-weather measurement and low cost. With the continuous development of this technology, the surface subsidence monitoring technology of D-InSAR is gradually introduced to the ground subsidence monitoring of the coal mine area. However, due to the complex and varied landform in loess area, the monitoring difficulty of D-InSAR technology has increased a lot. It also makes the monitoring of conventional methods more difficult. Sentinel-1 satellite has been applied in October 2014. Sentinel data become a data source of SAR image. Sentinel data also become data support of D-InSAR technology, and can effectively monitor deformation. In this paper, the processing steps of D-InSAR technology and the problems existing in each step are briefly described and the technical flow chart is drawn. 4 consecutive pairs of interference pairs in the time of the bingchang mining area were treated with D-InSAR, and the mining area deformation maps of 4 continuous periods were obtained. Through the superposition of 4 deformation maps one by one, the gradual process of the mining area and the settlement of the mining area is obtained and analyzed. The measured subsidence data and the processed subsidence data are compared and analyzed, and the cross section map of the working face line and the longitudinal line is drawn. The results show that: Sentinel-1 satellite data can perform differential interference processing well and carry out large area continuous monitoring, and also can well reflect the subsidence trend of mining area, and suitable for small deformation monitoring in mining area.However, the vegetation has a greater impact on the D-InSAR processing results of the sentinel-1 satellite data. The higher the vegetation coverage, the worse the coherence of the interference pairs.

AB  - In order to promote grain production, the government had implemented the agricultural subsidy policy. However, the existing methods were difficult to provide accurate decision-making support information, which made the effectiveness of this policy gradually reduced. In this paper, we proposed a method to calculate the agricultural decision information accurately by using multi-source remote sensing images. Firstly, we accurately extracted the boundary of cultivated land (geo-parcel) from high spatial resolution remote sensing image. Secondly, we constructed a NDVI time series from multi-source medium-resolution remote sensing images, established the growth curve of crop on each geo-parcel, and identify the crop type planted on each geo-parcel. Thirdly, we established the exact calculation model to realize the decision information calculation based on the geo-parcel. On the basis of the method proposed in this paper, we selected Li County, Hunan Province as the study area to carry out the application of grain planting subsidies. We find that the method proposed in this paper had obvious advantages by comparing the results with traditional methods. This method improves the accuracy and the objectivity of the results.

AB  - The foliage Clumping Index (CI) quantifies the level of foliage grouping within a distinct canopy structure relative to a random distribution. It is a key structure parameter for the ecological, hydrological, and land surface models. In this study, we investigate the influence of snow cover on the seasonal variation of global CI products derived from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) parameter products using the improved RTCLSR kernel-driven model. Results indicated that the cover of snow can lead to a much larger CI and thus considerably decrease the quality of the CI product. Statistics in 2006 indicates that more than 85% low quality pixels are covered by the snow. The average CI for evergreen needleleaf forests in winter will decrease about 0.1 after deducing the influence of snow covered pixels. The influence of snow cover should be carefully considered and corrected when analyzing the seasonal variation of the global CI product.

TI  - Upregulation of FOXP1 is a new independent unfavorable prognosticator and a specific predictor of lymphatic dissemination in cutaneous melanoma patients
T2  - ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: FOXP1 is a pleiotropic protein that plays important roles in immune responses (B-cell development regulation and differentiation of monocyte), organ development (cardiac valves, lung, and esophagus), and neuronal development. Besides being the primary regulator of normal human tissue development, FOXP1 also plays a role in tumorigenesis. However, the potential value of FOXP1 expression in tumor prognosis remains controversial. FOXP1 expression was assessed in tumor cells (TCs) and stromal cells (SCs) of cutaneous melanomas with the aim of analyzing the associations between FOXP1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics. We believe this article to be the first report analyzing the correlations between FOXP1 expression and clinicopathological, as well as histological, characteristics in melanoma.Materials and methods: In total, 96 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary cutaneous melanoma tissue specimens were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for FOXP1, and the results were correlated with classical clinicopathological features and patient survival.Results: FOXP1 overexpression in TCs was strongly associated with the presence of metastases in sentinel lymph nodes (p=0.0003, OR=11.66) and positive status of regional lymph nodes (p=0.0006, OR=22.15). In 96% (52 of 54) of patients presenting with low FOXP1 expression, no clinical or histopathological features of lymphatic dissemination were observed. However, thinner and nonulcerated tumors were reported to have increased numbers of FOXP1-positive SCs. In addition, a strong association was observed between FOXP1 upregulation in SCs and the absence of regional lymph node metastases. There was a significant correlation between FOXP1 upregulation in TCs and shorter cancer-specific overall survival (log-rank test, p=0.0040) and disease-free survival (log-rank test, p=0.0021). FOXP1 expression was confirmed in multivariate analysis as a factor that significantly unfavorably impacts prognosis in melanoma patients (HR=3.14, p=0.0299, adjusted for age, Breslow thickness, and sex).Conclusion: The findings from this study indicate that FOXP1 has a major role in melanoma progression, which makes it a candidate for molecular target-based cancer therapy.

TI  - Autumn leaf phenology: discrepancies between <i>in situ</i> observations and satellite data at urban and rural sites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Autumn phenophases, such as leaf colouration (LC) and leaf fall (LF), have received considerably less attention than their spring counterparts (budburst and leaf unfolding) but are equally important determinants of the duration of the growing season and thus have a controlling influence on the carbon-uptake period. Here, we examined THE trends (1968-2016) in in situ observations of the timing of LC and LF from a suite of deciduous trees at three rural sites and one urban site in Ireland. Satellite-derived autumn phenological metrics including mid-senescence (MS) and end of senescence (ES) based on two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 1982 to 2016 at a spatial resolution of 5km(2) were also examined. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of satellite remote sensing in capturing autumn phenology as determined by in situ observations. Analysis of in situ data (1968-2016) revealed the urban site to be significantly different from the rural sites as LC and LF occurred later in the season and the duration of the autumn season (LF-LC) became shorter over time. These trends may be partly driven by the presence of artificial light in the city. On average (1982-2016), there was a 6-day delay in the timing of MS compared to LC and a much larger difference (21 days) between ES and LF. This resulted in a 31-day autumn duration as defined by satellite data compared to 16 days from in situ observations. Furthermore, there was little overlap in timing between LC and MS, and LF and ES at the rural sites only. Discrepancies between in situ and satellite data may be attributed to the satellite data integrating a much broader vegetation signal across a heterogeneous landscape than in situ observations of individual trees. Therefore, at present, satellite-derived autumn phenology may be more successful in capturing in situ observations across large homogeneous landscapes of similar vegetation types (e.g. forested areas) than in heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. small mixed farms, urban areas, etc.) as is the case in Ireland where the in situ observations of trees may not be reflective of the overall vegetation. Matching the scale of satellite data with in situ observations remains a challenging task but may, at least in part, be

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th International Conference Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE)
CL  - Moscow, RUSSIA
AB  - Social trends of technologization and informatization, an increasing focus on rational thinking have failed to displace traditional fundamental social and psychological basics of human culture. Despite all social transformations, mythological ideas still remain a powerful instrument for personal socialization, adjusting the formation of values, moral reference points and attitudes via literature, advertising and cinematography. They make an impact on socialization and subjective well-being by activating components of the collective unconscious. One of the main sources of the present-day mythological ideas are fairy-tales plots and images; when acquired, they allow an individual to predict social interaction' results, to create the figurative picture of the world that triggers the simulation of fairy-tale characters' behaviour. Thus, mythological ideas present a significant pedagogical tool because of its strong influence on adolescents' identification and socialization determined by broadening self-consciousness and the following exit of the archetypical behavioural patterns from the unconscious to consciousness. At the same time, it is a high-risk area where negative manipulative effects on teenagers may occur.The practical importance of the study analyzing the role of mythological resources in personal development gives further insight into adolescents' worldview that allows for anticipating the trends in their behavioural strategies and social values, identifying possible risks and providing an optimal environment for the child's personal subjective well-being to be secure.

M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is devoted to the urgent problem of diverse reflection of the linguistic and cultural worldview. The research purpose is to characterize semantic and structural peculiarities of the verbal gastronomic metaphor as the manifestation mechanism of the gastronomic metaphoric code of the French linguistic culture. The realization of the research tasks has been achieved through the use of the corpus of phraseological units with a "gastronomic verb" as a core component. Semantic peculiarities of the verbal gastronomic metaphor have been examined on the basis of a group of verbs that define meals: a semantic classification of such metaphors has been worked out. It has been suggested that the most diverse metaphors are those that define person's internal and external character traits as well as state and relationship with other people. Structural peculiarities of a verbal gastronomic metaphor have been examined on the basis of a group of verbs meaning multiple cooking techniques and actions: cognitive supports of such metaphors have been established, models and sub-models of their formation have been revealed; it has been determined that structural diversity is the peculiarity of a gastronomic metaphor that is formed with a transitive verb as a core component. It has been proved that gastronomic metaphor nominating a wide variety of objects, signs, phenomena, processes, the world, serves as a marker of French linguistic culture.

AB  - The Black Sea dynamics during 25 years is analysed using numerical simulation and assimilation of remote sensing data. Numerical circulation model has horizontal space resolution of 4.8 km and 40 vertical levels. It includes a turbulent model of the Mellor-Yamada type. Results of simulation were validated by comparing with temperature and salinity profiles from hydrological surveys. Analysis of the results shows that the temperature of the sea upper layer grows. Salinity of upper 30m layer also increases, but in the layer 30-100m it decreases. The results of simulation reproduce authentically circulation in the upper layer of the Black Sea. According to simulation, mean currents, directed opposite to the surface one, are observed at a depth of more than 400 m.

AB  - The present study aims: (a) to assess the correlations between forest stand characteristics (viz., basal area, dominant height, and volume) and the reflectance values derived from Landsat 5 TM spectral bands as well as from vegetation indices and (b) to understand how Eucalyptus sp. stand age influences these correlations. Sampling data comprised a set of 35 permanent plots from a forest inventory conducted annually between 2006 and 2011. Spectral data were derived from Landsat 5 TM images. The results showed that TM4 and TM5 spectral bands, as well as vegetation indices ND54 and TM5/4, were better correlated with basal area and volume, while the TM2 spectral band was better correlated with dominant height. Eucalyptus sp. stand age directly influenced the correlations between spectral data and forest stand characteristics, and could not be disregarded in the spectral characterization of the forest variables.

T2  - Ciencia e Natura
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, the coral reefs are distributed for practically the whole tropical coast. The urbanization of coastal regions and changes of the climate in global scale can occasion negative impacts on tins ecosystem. where the identification of the coral reefs from remote sensing is an important initiative to facilitate the management of these areas. This paper proposes a radiometric/spectral evaluation of three banks in the Complex Coral Reefs of the Abrolhos-BA (Vicosa, Coroa Vermelha and Sebastiao Games), through graphic sensitivity and Optimum Index Factor (OIF). in satellite images OLI/Landsat-8. The sensitivity of the three banks in coral reefs was similar The spectral bands B1, B2, B3, B4 showed sensitivity to enhance the coral reef, the sea water, and from the near-infrared region (>=B5) there was no any sensitivity: even for some emerged coral reefs, as demonstrated statistical Test-t (Student). where there was no difference statistics between the digital values of coral reefs and sea water since the p-Value was greater than the significance level (alpha - 0.05). Of the four spectral bands in the visible region (B1, B2. B3 and B4), only the B1 presented no significant difference. According to OIF the best color composition for visual differentiation of sea water of coral reefs was IR 2G 4B (5403.3).

AB  - The Sentinel-1 satellites provide the formerly unprecedented combination of high spatial and temporal resolution of dual polarization synthetic aperture radar data. The availability of dense time series enables the derivation and analysis of temporally filtered annual backscatter signals. The study concentrates on the use of Sentinel-1 seasonal backscatter signatures for forest area estimation and forest type classification. A classification method based on time series similarity measures is introduced and tested in three test areas covered by various forest types including broadleaf temperate, boreal and montane forests. The results are compared with two European-wide Copernicus high resolution layers, namely forest type and tree cover density (TCD). The correspondence of forest/non-forest maps and TCD is high in all test areas, with overall accuracies for forest/non-forest classification between 86% and 91% and Pearson correlation coefficients for TCD between 0.68 and 0.74. The forest type classification (non-forest, coniferous and broadleaf forest classes) provides best results in temperate forests with an overall accuracy of 85%; in boreal forest, the accuracy decreases to only 65%. Generally, the method provides reliable results for forest area estimation, including regions where methods based on static parameters are often problematic (mountainous areas), and it enables forest type classification in temperate forests.

AB  - The work demonstrates the possibility of aircraft detection using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar image series with 10 m resolution using change detection method. Sentinel-1 data can be used for detection of large aircraft as additional "indicators", effective in combination with high resolution observations. The results of processing are demonstrated using a series of 15 SAR images acquired within the period from January to November 2017. Presented examples show that the results of aircraft detection in many cases clearly correspond to the number of targets that can be detected in the images manually. The probability of correct detection, estimated in real observation conditions for the most of images exceeded 0,8 and the final probability for all series was 0,76.

TI  - Remote-sensing imagery classification using multiple classification algorithm-based AdaBoost
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - AdaBoost demonstrates excellent performance in remote sensing (RS) image classification, but as it works on only one classification algorithm, the disadvantage of the classification algorithm itself is difficult to overcome, resulting in limitations in the improvement of classification accuracy. In this article, a modified AdaBoost, a multiple classification algorithm-based AdaBoost (MCA AdaBoost), is proposed to improve remote sensing image classification. The new method works on more than one classification algorithm and can make full use of the advantages of different learning algorithms. Based on a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image whose spatial resolution was enhanced to 15 m with a panchromatic band, a C4.5 decision tree, Naive Bayes, and artificial neural network were used as objects to verify and compare the performance of both AdaBoost and MCA AdaBoost. The experimental results show that MCA AdaBoost successfully inherits the benefits of the original AdaBoost, combines the advantages of different classification algorithms and lowers overfitting. By increasing diversity and complementarity among base classifiers, MCA AdaBoost outperforms AdaBoost in terms of RS classification accuracy improvement.

TI  - Image Degradation for Quality Assessment of Pan-Sharpening Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wald's protocol is the most widely accepted protocol to assess pan-sharpening algorithms. In particular, the synthesis propertywhich is usually validated on a reduced scaleis thought to be a necessary and sufficient condition of a success image fusion. Usually, the synthesis property is evaluated at a reduced resolution scale to take the original multispectral (MS) image as reference; thus, the image degradation method that is employed to produce reduced resolution images is crucial. In the past decade, the standard method has been to decimate the low-pass-filtered image where the filter is designed to match the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the sensor. The paper pointed out the deficiency of the method, and proposed a new image degradation method, referred to as method of spatial degradation for fusion validation (MSD4FV), which takes MTF compensation into account based on a simplified MTF model. The simulation results supported the implicit assumption of Wald's protocol that image fusion performance is invariant among scales if the images have been properly degraded.

T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE
M3  - Review
AB  - This article highlights current research into land and water resources, agroecosystems, and agricultural production systems published by the Natural Resources and Environmental Systems (NRES) community of ASABE journals (Transactions of the ASABE and Applied Engineering in Agriculture) in 2017. Context, scope, and key results of the published articles are reviewed and perhaps more importantly areas for increased research attention are recommended. This article describes experimental and modeling advances in hydrology, agroecosystems, climate change effects, soil erosion, agricultural irrigation, agricultural drainage, forest resource management, livestock systems, natural treatment systems, international water issues, and water quality topic areas. Three special collections were published (International Watershed Technology, Crop Modeling and Decision Support for Optimizing Use of Limited Water, and Advances in Drainage). Other focal areas included 14 articles relating to livestock waste management, 13 concerning irrigated agricultural systems, 8 addressing climate change effects on land, water, and agroecosystems, and 16 on various aspects of soil erosion measurement and modeling. Building on the articles reviewed from 2017 and toward a vision of future agroecosystems research, the NRES community of ASABE journals strives to expand its role in making new knowledge accessible to sustain agricultural and natural systems in a changing world. With this goal in mind, recommendations for future research needs are proposed with an emphasis on increased application of remote sensing data to agroecosystems research, improved assessment of agroecosystem resiliency and vulnerability to land and climate change, development of integrated models of agroecosystem services, meeting stubborn water management challenges in agricultural production systems, and focusing on publishing fully reproducible model results.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - We present a new approach for incorporating incidence angle derived synthetic aperture radar (SAR) brightness variation directly into SAR image analysis. This approach is unique in that the incidence angle dependency is modeled explicitly into the probability density function rather than an image-wide pre-processing 'correction'. It can then be used for supervised and unsupervised image analysis, and is notably able to account for a different dependency rate for each class. This has potential benefits for wide-swath SAR imagery over flat areas and ocean, wide angled airborne and UAV based SAR data, connecting narrow-beam SAR images at different acquisition angles, as well as land-based analysis with local topographic terrain angles. An initial example demonstrates unsupervised image segmentation applied to sea ice mapping for meteorological services and climate science, and is compared to the same algorithm without the incidence angle modeling.

AB  - The objective of this study is to map the spatial distribution of the aboveground biomass (AGB, tC/ha) storage of the Pinus kesiya Royle ex Gordon (Benguet pine) forest of Sagada, Mt. Province, Philippines by integrating Landsat image and the forest cover map. The data was obtained from 66 plots that were established in the different Benguet pine stands in Sagada. The AGB was estimated using the Digital Numbers (DN) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values (with filter and with no filter). The estimated aboveground biomass (AGB) density of the Benguet pine was determined to be 249.66 tonnes/ha corresponding to 112.35 tonnesC/ha.

TI  - GWAS of Response to haloperidol in psychosis
T2  - GWAS Central
M3  - Data study
AB  - AIM: The aim of the study was to detect the genetic predictors of reseponse to haloperidol. BACKGROUND: Haloperidol is a benchmark drug for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia, but the genetics of its efficacy is yet to be elucidated. METHODS: A genome-wide association analysis was carried out in a small sample of patients treated with haloperidol (n=96) and the results were replicated in a larger sample of patients treated with second-generation antipsychotics or perphenazine (final n=169, available from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials for Intervention Effectiveness study). The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale % score decrease was the outcome in both samples. The period of observation was restricted to 1 month in the replication sample and the most severe cases were included to best balance the replication. The quality control (QC) for the investigation and replication sample included a minor allele frequency at least 0.01, call rate at least 0.95, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P at least 0.0001. The source for imputation was the 1000 Genomes Pilot+HapMap 3 dataset. In total 1 080 870 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were available after imputation and QC in the investigation sample. After QC of real genotypes, locus-targeted imputations were restricted to windows of 10 kb on either side of the sentinel SNP in the replication sample. Sentinel SNPs were the most significant findings in the investigation sample. Analysis of variance was the test of choice, PLINK, SNPTEST, and GTOOL were used in the analysis. RESULTS: Two SNPs (rs7912580 and rs2412459) were associated with response in both samples, respectively, located in an intergenic region between the AT-rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B, MRF1-like) gene and rhotekin 2 (RTKN2) gene, an intronic region located in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha kinase 4 (EIF2AK4) gene (P=1.358e-06 and 0.015 for the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale % total score decrease in the investigation and replication samples, respectively). The direction of association was opposite in the two samples, a finding that is sometimes reported as a flip-flop association. CONCLUSION: Heterozygosis for the ancestral allele was associated with the best improvement in the investigation sample and with poorer outcome in the replication sample. This discrepancy can be because of differences in the replication and investigation sample including the drugs used and the severity at baseline. Nevertheless, this finding is in line with two relevant hypothesis of schizophrenia, related to alterations in the immunological system (RTKN2) and in the neurodevelopment of the central nervous system (EIF2AK4). More studies are warranted to further investigate these associations.

AB  - Shallow water bathymetry is recognized as one of the most fundamental topics in environmental studies, seabed morphology research and management of the coastal zone. The detailed mapping as well as the long-term monitoring of the changes in shallow marine relief is important for the successful completion of coastal construction and environmental projects. In recent years, optical satellite imagery is proving to be a useful tool to determine coastal bathymetry, as it provides a time- and cost-effective solution to water depths estimation. In this paper, the two most popular and successful approaches for bathymetry retrieval, the Lyzenga (1985) linear bathymetry model and the Stumpf et al. (2003) ratio method, have been applied to Worldview-2 satellite imagery, in order to derive the more accurate bathymetric model for the shallow-water region of the Chania Gulf, located in NW Crete Island, Greece. This area is sea-grass free and is dominated by sandy substrate with a few rocky outcrops. The models are implemented over the total study area no separation in subareas according to the bottom type. The results are compared with echo sounding ground truth depth data. The outcomes of the statistical analysis indicate that the linear model provides increased accuracy than the ratio one over the sandy bottom. On the contrary, in those parts covered by rocky bottoms, none of the two models provided satisfactory results.

TI  - Socioeconomic status and breast cancer treatment
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Evidence suggests substantial disparities in breast cancer survival by socioeconomic status (SES). We examine the extent to which receipt of newer, less invasive, or more effective treatments-a plausible source of disparities in survival-varies by SES among elderly women with early-stage breast cancer.Multivariate regression analyses applied to 11,368 women (age 66-90 years) identified from SEER-Medicare as having invasive breast cancer diagnosed in 2006-2009. Socioeconomic status was defined based on Medicaid enrollment and level of poverty of the census tract of residence. All analyses controlled for demographic, clinical health status, spatial, and healthcare system characteristics.Poor and near-poor women were less likely than high SES women to receive sentinel lymph node biopsy and radiation after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Poor women were also less likely than near-poor or high SES women to receive any axillary surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. There were no significant differences in use of aromatase inhibitors (AI) between poor and high SES women. However, near-poor women who initiated hormonal therapy were more likely to rely exclusively on tamoxifen, and less likely to use the more expensive but more effective AI when compared to both poor and high SES women.Our results indicate that SES disparities in the receipt of treatments for incident breast cancer are both pervasive and substantial. These disparities remained despite women's geographic area of residence and extent of disease, suggesting important gaps in access to effective breast cancer care.

AB  - Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Occultation measurements can remote sensing Earth's neutral atmosphere and ionosphere. Meanwhile, another GNSS remote sensing technique named GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has been developed rapidly, which can retrieve sea surface wind speed. The GNSS Occultation Sounder (GNOS) II instrument has been designed to integrate these two GNSS remote sensing techniques in one payload of the third batch FengYun-3 (FY-3) satellites. This paper presents the advancements in research of GNOS II and instrument performance. The qualified module of GNOS II has been manufactured by National Space Science Center (NSSC), Chinese Academy of Sciences. We show that the phase center variety is low enough for the new designed precise orbit determination (POD) antenna to increase the accuracy of precise orbit determination. A wide coverage atmosphere occultation antenna and a 65nm technics ASIC are used in the new generation GNOS instrument. As an important improvement, the GNOS II can generate Delay Doppler Maps (DDMs) of GNSS signals scattered from the ocean surface. The result of test shows that the GNOS II instrument has high performance in precision of code, carrier phase and real-time navigation.

T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Nitrogen content of rice leaves has a significant effect on growth quality and crop yield. We proposed and demonstrated a non-invasive method'Or the quantitative inversion of rice nitrogen content based on hyperspectral remote sensing data collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Rice canopy albedo images were acquired by a hyperspectral imager onboard an M600-UAV platform. The radiation calibration method was then used to process these data and the reflectance of canopy leaves was acquired. Experimental validation was conducted using the rice field of Shenyang Agricultural University, which was classified into 4 fertilizer levels: zero nitrogen, low nitrogen, normal nitrogen, and high nitrogen. Gaussian process regression (GPR) was then used to train the inversion algorithm to identify specific spectral bands with the highest contribution. This led to a reduction in noise and a higher inversion accuracy. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also used for dimensionality reduction, thereby reducing redundant information and significantly increasing efficiency. A comparison with ground truth measurements demonstrated that the proposed technique was successful in establishing a nitrogen inversion model, the accuracy of which was quantified using a linear fit (R-2=0.8525) and the root mean square error (RAISE=0.9507). These results support the use of GPR and provide a theoretical basis for the inversion of.rice nitrogen by UAV hyperspectral remote sensing.

TI  - Assessing the effectiveness of land consolidation for improving agricultural productivity in China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural production in China is crucial for socioeconomic development and food security. Land consolidation has been regarded as an important way to maintain food security and is highly valued by the Chinese government. However, whether productivity improvements can be achieved through land consolidation is not yet clear. To address this, we propose a straightforward method to assess agricultural productivity changes using remote sensing data. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is used to represent yield, as its changes correlate significantly with yield changes. The analysis uses a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer NDVI time series covering a period of 13 years (2001-2013) at a spatial resolution of 250 m and data on projects completed in 2006 and 2007. Control sites near the projects are used to eliminate the influence of other factors. The results show that 62.90% and 58.34% of projects in 2006 and 2007, respectfully, were effective at improving productivity, whereas 56.51% and 52.56%, respectfully, effectively stabilized productivity. Generally speaking, 78.67% of projects in 2006 and 78.32% of those in 2007 proved effective at either improving or stabilizing productivity; however, only 40.56% and 34.34%, respectfully, were effective at doing both. Furthermore, it should be noted that areas with effective productivity improvements mainly benefitted from growth in the cropping area and that the annual yield per unit area on project areas decreased within a few years after consolidation. The lack of effectiveness may be caused by problems of engineering, construction, and subsequent management. Governments must thus consider new consolidation projects comprehensively and cautiously before launching them.

AB  - Continuous research has been conducted in Bandung City, West Java province, Indonesia over the past two decades. Previous studies carried out in a regional-scale might be useful for estimating the correlation between land subsidence and groundwater extraction, but inadequate for local safety management as subsidence may vary over different areas with detailed characters. This study is focused primarily on subsidence phenomenon in local, and patchy scales, respectively, with Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 dataset acquired from September 2014 to July 2017. In order to understand the subsidence in a more systematic way, six 10-cm subsidence zones have been selected known as Zone A to F. Further analyses conducted over multiple scales show that industrial usage of groundwater is not always the dominant factor that causes the land subsidence and indeed it does not always create large land subsidence either. Regions experiencing subsidence is due to a combined impact of a number of factors, e.g., residential, industrial or agricultural activities.

M3  - Article
AB  - Coalbed methane (CBM) exploration generally refers to a technique that extracts natural gas from coal beds. The development of CBM in Liulin, China, has experienced a significantly growth period during the past two decades. Previous research mainly focused on the coal geological background or CBM technique itself, while time series InSAR (TS-InSAR) technique was conducted in this work to study the potential land deformation induced by CBM extraction from 2003 to 2011. In total, 21 ALOS-1 PALSAR images (acquired from 22 December 2006 to 2 January 2011) and 14 ENVISAT ASAR scenes (captured between 29 October 2003 and 7 November 2007) were used. The TS-InSAR outcome revealed that the annual deformation rates were ranging from 15 to -40 mm yr(-1) over the study region. Then the time series deformation evolutions were analysed over 8 CBM sites (No. 4 coal seam) out of 20, and the subsidence rates between 1.9 and -6.5 mm yr(-1) were derived. In addition, the average subsidence rate and standard deviation among these eight measurements were -3.0 and 2.6 mm yr(-1) respectively, suggesting that these CBM extraction sites were quite stable and no obvious subsidence had been observed during this eight-year period.

TI  - Mapping land subsidence over the eastern Beijing city using satellite radar interferometry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Beijing City has suffered from groundwater-induced subsidence since the late 1930s and the over-exploration of groundwater could lead to subsidence as much as -12.0 cmyr(-1). Previous studies on the ground deformation at Beijing City mainly focused on the period before the year of 2014 when a mega-engineering project was launched to reduce water shortage in Beijing. To study the most recent ground deformation, 19 L-band ALOS-1 PALSAR images (June 2007-January 2011), 24 C-band Sentinel-1 SAR images (June 2015-November 2016) together with 9 ALOS-2 PALSAR acquisitions (September 2014-February 2017) were analysed in this work. Levelling measurements were exploited to verify the ALOS-1-based time series InSAR (TS-InSAR) result while Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 result were cross-verified with each other. Furthermore, the whole study area was divided into four sub-zones, and the result indicated that the subsidence rates over five townships, Cuigezhuan, Jinzhan, Liyuan, Songzhuang and Yanjiao were accelerating and more attentions should be paid. On the contrary, the town centre of Douge Zhuang township experienced a decreasing trend between these two temporal-periods. Additionally, the time series measurements with respect to five selected measurement points and the profile line along the subsidence hot spots were analysed.

TI  - Investigation on mining subsidence over Appin-West Cliff Colliery using time-series SAR interferometry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced Time Series InSAR (ATS-InSAR) generally refers to those TS-InSAR methods with an external distributed scatterer selection module, e.g. SqueeSAR (TM), and GEOS-ATSA (Advanced Time-Series Analysis). It is being known as a very efficient tool for monitoring ground deformation over suburban or non-urban regions with great success. However, research conducted using C-band Envisat-based ATS-InSAR failed to produce reasonable outcome within Appin Colliery primarily due to the underground mining effect, which is located in the southeastern corner of the Southern Coalfield, New South Wales, Australia; thus, the general underground mining pattern cannot be formed. This work presents a modified ATS-InSAR method for mapping the ground deformation over underground mining region. More specifically, in order to achieve the best outcome, a modified measurement scatterer (MS) pixel selection method is introduced by including less reliable MS pixels through an Inverse Distance Weighted-based integration method. In addition, the proposed method is also applied to C-band Sentinel-1 image stacks for testing purpose, and the final result proved to be efficient to offer sufficient information to the mining industry and government for risk management purpose.

TI  - Lake Area Analysis Using Exponential Smoothing Model and Long Time-Series Landsat Images in Wuhan, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss of lake area significantly influences the climate change in a region, and this loss represents a serious and unavoidable challenge to maintaining ecological sustainability under the circumstances of lakes that are being filled. Therefore, mapping and forecasting changes in the lake is critical for protecting the environment and mitigating ecological problems in the urban district. We created an accessible map displaying area changes for 82 lakes in the Wuhan city using remote sensing data in conjunction with visual interpretation by combining field data with Landsat 2/5/7/8 Thematic Mapper (TM) time-series images for the period 1987-2013. In addition, we applied a quadratic exponential smoothing model to forecast lake area changes in Wuhan city. The map provides, for the first time, estimates of lake development in Wuhan using data required for local-scale studies. The model predicted a lake area reduction of 18.494 km(2) in 2015. The average error reached 0.23 with a correlation coefficient of 0.98, indicating that the model is reliable. The paper provided a numerical analysis and forecasting method to provide a better understanding of lake area changes. The modeling and mapping results can help assess aquatic habitat suitability and property planning for Wuhan lakes.

AB  - The existing remote sensing interpretation methods was proposed based on the spectral characteristics of the pure minerals in the basic of spectrum database, but they did not take the actual spectral data and the content of data of rock and minerals into consideration. This study carried out a lithological inversion application research based on a WorldView-2 and ASTER multispectral data. In the basic of deeply analysis of WorldView-2 and ASTER data characteristics, we carried out a series of researches including the classification of accrual measurement rock wave spectrum, image post-processing and lithology inversion method research of wave spectrum. At last, we preliminary proposed a new end-member extraction + spectrum matching method to interpret lithology of rock in adjacent area. And this method is applied to West Kunlun Ke Liyang region. In the condition of the field investigation, we applied this method efficiently interpreting the lithological characters of the adjacent area in which the corresponding field investigation do not need.

TI  - Lake evolution in the Qaidam Basin during 1976-2015 and their changes in response to climate and anthropogenic factors
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes in the Qaidam Basin play a critical role in maintaining the fragile ecological environment. Moreover, the salt lakes in this region are important mineral resource. Since the beginning of the 21st century, lake area in this basin has changed drastically due to the driving of climate change and human activities. For further understanding lake evolution in this basin, lakes larger than 1 km2 between 1976 and 2015 are derived from Landsat data. The results show that lake area in the basin has experienced four evolution stages, i.e. extension in 1976-1990, shrinkage in 1990-2000, extension in 2000-2010, and shrinkage in 2010-2015. The largest lake area is appeared in 2010. In terms of climatic and hydrological factors, the precipitation and runoff are the dominant factors for lake area variations. The change of lake area is most closely related to the precipitation and runoff in the first 3 years. Since 2000, both climate change and human activities such as water consumption in the catchment, blocking rivers and lakes connection around the lake, brine mining utilization, constructions of solar ponds have significant influence on the spatial pattern and size of the central lakes of the basin. A new lake was formed at Kushui River and south of Lake Dabuxun, the areas of Lakes Ya and Tuanjie were significantly expanded, the East and West Lake Taijinar shrank and dried, and the Lake Yiliping expanded from a playa to the largest lake in the Qaidam Basin in 2010. In view of the negative influence of the large scale exploitation of saline lakes, this paper puts forward some suggestions for the rational development of saline lake resources.

AB  - In recent years, the use of deep learning in remote sensing domain has made it possible to automate mapping in large-scale. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning method which pre-train a convolutional neural network (CNN) with middle-resolution remote sensing data in 2016, and fine-tune it in following years with a spot of high-resolution remote sensing data in 2017. We used the fine-tuned model to mapping the early-rice in 25 countries which cost only 21 minutes, and yielded an overall accuracy of 81.68%. The result demonstrate that the convolutional neural network model can transfer in different time period with little adjustment in a very high accuracy.

TI  - Estimating forest standing biomass in savanna woodlands as an indicator of forest productivity using the new generation WorldView-2 sensor
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and up-to-date information on forest dendrometric traits, such as above ground biomass is important in understanding the contribution of terrestrial ecosystems to the regulation of atmsopheric carbon, especially in the face of global environmental change. Besides, dendrometric traits information is critical in assessing the healthy and the spatial planning of fragile ecosystems, such as the savanna dry forests. The aim of this work was to test whether red-edge spectral data derived from WorldView-2 multispectral imagery improve biomass estimation in savanna dry forests. The results of this study have shown that biomass estimation using all Worldview-2 raw spectral bands without the red-edge band yielded low estimation accuracies (R-2 of 0.67 and a RMSE-CV of 2.2 t ha(-1)) when compared to when the rededge band was included as a co-variate (R-2 of 0.73 and a RMSE-CV of 2.04 t ha(-1)). Also, similar results were obseved when all WorldView-2 vegetation indices (without the red-edge computed ones), producing slightly low accuracies (R-2 of about 0.67 and a RMSE-CV of 2.20 t ha(-1)), when compared to those obtained using all indices and RE-computed indices(R-2 of 0.76 and a RMSE-CV of 1.88 t ha(-1)). Overall, the findings of this work have demontrated the potential and importance of strategically positioned bands, such as the red-edge band in the optimal estimation of indigeonus forest biomass. These results underscores the need to shift towards embracing sensors with unique and strategeically positioned bands, such as the forthcoming Sentinel 2 MSI and HysPIRI which have a global footprint.

TI  - A novel approach for estimation of residual attitude of a remote-sensing satellite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a novel approach for estimation of the residual attitude of a remote-sensing satellite based on satellite images with ancillary information and ground control points (GCPs). First, a non-linear model which translates the residual errors in roll, pitch, and yaw to scan-errors and pixel-errors in the image space is established. Subsequently, using the model and given scan-errors and pixel-errors at GCPs, an estimate of residual roll, pitch, and yaw based on the least square minimization of residuals in conjunction with the Newton's method for non-linear optimization is proposed. A simulation is carried out to show that the estimates of residual roll and pitch are within 0.0008 degrees (equivalent to 0.5 pixel) and the residual yaw is within 0.015 degrees (equivalent to 0.75 pixel at the extreme ends) to its true values. The results of the article can be applied to determine the residual attitude of any remote-sensing satellite. We demonstrate our results by estimating the residual attitude based on the data-products of various Indian remote-sensing satellites. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by comparing the results with that of existing technique and it is concluded that the presented technique estimates residual attitude more accurately than the existing method.

AB  - Agriculture plays an important role in the economy of the Maghreb region. Most of the water needed for irrigation comes from pumping of the aquifers. A controlled pumping of the groundwater resources does not exist yet, thus, estimating the total water consumption for agricultural use only with in situ data is nearly impossible. In order to overcome this lack of information, Copernicus data are used for determining the groundwater withdrawal through agriculture in the Maghreb region. This paper presents an approach for estimating and monitoring crop water requirements in Tunisia based on multitemporal Sentinel-2 data. Using this multitemporal information, a thorough analysis of the different culture types over time is possible, from which a set of additional multitemporal features is deduced for crop type classification. In this paper, the contribution of those features is analyzed, showing a classification accuracy enhanced by 10% with the multitemporal features. Furthermore, relying on existing methods and FAO standards for the estimation of crop water needs, the methodology aims to estimate the specific crop water consumption. The results of the water estimates are validated against delimited areas where estimates of the water consumption are available from the authorities. Finally, as the study is conducted within the framework of an international technical cooperation, the methodology aims to be reproducible and sustainable for local authorities. The particularity of the results presented here is that they are achieved through automatic processing and using exclusively Open Source solutions, deployable on simple workstations.

T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The global crisis of civilization sharply exacerbated the biosocial problem. In the development of social theories, however, its fundamental paradox does not find proper reflection: the society has grown out of the terrestrial biological system, which remains its vital basis. But its development is destroying it, leading to death, and thus the society is killing itself. This suicidal development direction is obvious. But there is no decisive resistance to this. To change the current course of development of the Earth civilization, it is necessary to change the mass consciousness, its negative features such as irrepressible consumerism, aggressiveness. But first of all, we must change the consciousness of the world political, economic, intellectual elite and, first of all, our philosophical consciousness. In the materials of the 50th Anniversary Report of the Club of Rome, the threats of the global crisis are thoroughly revealed, the need for a "new worldview", a" new philosophy" is underlined. However, the measures proposed in it leave out the most acute points of the biosocial problem. And it is from their decision the fate of earthly civilization depends. The necessary change in mass consciousness means a change in the nature of man. Is it possible? This is the extraordinary difficulty of the task of transition to a new stage in the development of the society. The author considers the debatable issues of this problem, the possibility of human transformation in the process of anthropotechnological evolution.

TI  - A Framework for Buddhist Environmentalism: The Horizontal and Vertical Dimensions
T2  - International Journal of Buddhist Thought and Culture
M3  - research-article
AB  - Resorting to Buddhism to advance a form of religious environmentalism has been done by many scholars both from inside and outside the tradition because Buddhism holds a worldview and a number of teachings often perceived as environmentally friendly. This paper contributes to this effort by proposing a framework that is faithful to the Buddhist pedagogical approach. It asserts that this approach comprises two overarching and integral dimensionsa horizontal (relational) and a vertical (developmental) dimension. In establishing Buddhist environmentalism, the horizontal dimension is employed to assess the root cause of the environmental crisis and the state of human-nature relationship. The horizontal dimension also helps to provide a corrective to the abnormalities in this relationship is proposing a vision of harmonious human-nature relationship characterized by solidarity, responsibility, accountability, service and gratitude. These relationships can be established by resorting to Buddhist cosmogony and fundamental teachings such as the Principle of Dependent Origination and the Three Characteristics of Existence. The vertical dimension constitutes the prescriptive aspect of Buddhist environmentalism, which insists that self-cultivation aimed at emancipation from mundane existence is part and parcel of the effort to promote self and environmental well-being. It asserts that human-nature relationship must be added to the total number of relationships in one’s life, and it must be held in view in the process of self-cultivation so that it becomes an indicator of a person’s spiritual progress. Virtues such as loving kindness, gentleness, moderation and generosity developed through the Noble Eightfold Path not only go towards promoting interpersonal relationship but also promote environmental well-being and flourishing. Consequently, this paper is critical of any Buddhist environmentalism that fails to give due attention to both dimensions, and it emphasizes that both the relational and developmental dimensions must be held in balance in order for a genuine Buddhist environmentalism to be possible.

TI  - Image-Based Rapid Estimation of Frost Damage in Canola (<i>Brassica napus</i> L.)
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional methods of estimating frost damage to crops are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Remote sensing imagery and vegetation indices can be used for condition assessment, however, the utility of using vegetative indices in assessing frost damage specifically is not known. The objective of this study was to estimate the freezing injury using a vegetative index developed from hyperspectral imagery. Three replicates of six 6-leaf stage canola plants were subjected to a temperature of -10 degrees C for 6hr. The resulting frozen plants were imaged at 6 different thawing times using an imaging spectrophotometer (400-1000nm). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and triangular vegetation index (TVI) were calculated. Contrary to expectations, NDVI values from frozen plants increased in the initial thawing treatments (1, 2 and 4hr) and then decreased at 8hr. Whereas, TVI values decreased gradually with increased duration of thawing. Furthermore, when compared to NDVI, TVI clearly differentiated frozen from control plants and within the freezing treatments. The differential modes of response of the indices to post-freezing reflectance changes is the possible reason. These results suggest that with recent advancements in low altitude remote sensing in the areas of spectral, spatial and temporal resolution, early estimation of frost damage is possible.

C8  - 1
AB  - Remote sensing data has the potential to revolutionize social science. One of the most prominent examples of this is the Nighttime Lights dataset, which provides digital measures of nighttime luminosity from 1992 to 2013. This study evaluates the Nighttime Lights data against detailed rural electrification data from the 2011 Census of India. The results suggest that many nighttime luminosity measures derived from satellite data are surprisingly accurate for measuring rural electrification, even at the village level and using simple statistical tools. We also demonstrate that this accuracy can be substantially improved by using of better GIS maps, basic geoprocessing tools, and particular aggregations of nighttime luminosity. Nighttime luminosity performs worse in measuring financial inclusion or proxies of poverty, however, and detects rural electrification less accurately when the supply of power is intermittent. These results offer guidelines for when and how remote sensing data can be used when administrative data is absent or unreliable.

AB  - Advanced interpretation of satellite images calls for automated content analysis as well as interactive content search. A typical example of such systems is EOLib, an ESA funded project that already demonstrated the application potential of TerraSAR-X data within a satellite payload ground segment. In this paper, we analyze the validation results of image content classification using a large set of selected TerraSAR-X images. The classification was done with a cascaded learning method. The main advantage of this method is a coarse-to-fine approach for semantically annotating pixel patches with decreasing size. Once a reliable label is found for a given pixel patch, no further subdivision into still smaller patch sizes is necessary. This leads to a considerable reduction of the computational effort during classification of large-size satellite images.

AB  - During the last three years the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1 (S1) mission, gathered large collections of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data over the Earth's surface. A wide variety of SAR applications have benefited from the use of large stacks of S1 products. Surface displacement monitoring, land cover mapping, crop monitoring or flood detection are successful examples that are being increasingly employed by both public administrations and/or private companies in order to improve the productivity of processes (mining or oil & gas sector) and to provide a rapid response in front of disaster risk management (earthquakes, floods, etc.). The features of S1 sensor, i.e, short revisiting time, wide area processing, high slant-range resolution, improved radiometric accuracy or the availability to work with dual polarimetric data, benefits the reliability of all these applications. In this paper the benefits of multi-temporal SAR applications based on DARES TECHNOLOGY experience using S1 sensor is presented over three classic SAR applications.

TI  - OF FESTIVALS, RIGHTS AND PUBLIC LIFE: SEX WORKERS' ACTIVISM IN INDIA AS AFFIRMATIVE SABOTAGE
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FEMINIST LAW JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2012, Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC), India's largest sex workers' collective, organised a major Hindu religious festival of Bengal called the Durga Puja. It was a part of their rights activism for the decriminalisation of sex work. In this article, I provide an account of this event as an act of re-ordering public life by sex workers and contend that the worldview which informs DMSC's practice of the festival has points of convergence with Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's articulation of the idea of affirmative sabotage. I argue that we are able to see this convergence between DMSC's celebration of the festival and post-colonial feminist thought by attending to the particular location and the relations that DMSC's practice of the Durga Puja inhabits. I situate this account of sex workers' rights activism alongside a rival narrative of the festival put forth by Dalit and adivasi groups. I include this rival account to perform the limitation of my own reading of the political potential of DMSC's practice of the festival. This rival assertion demands a recognition of the situatedness and limitedness of feminist practices.

CL  - Dehradun, INDIA
AB  - Urban environment is examined through time series Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) and OLI/TIRS (Operational Land Imager & Thermal Infrared Sensor) sensor images. A continuous surface of Land Surface Temperature (LST) can be extracted from Landsat thermal bands. Similarly different band combinations and ratios will give spatial pattern of land cover categories. Among these, building and vegetation indices are used to characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of elevated temperature zones in cities. This excess heat concentration creates thermal hotspots which are known as Urban Heat Islands (UHI). Parameters of land cover are then related to LST to detect the influence of urbanization on intensity and extent of heat islands, by pixel based quantitative analysis. This paper focuses on two megacities of India and their surrounding districts for identifying the critical UHI areas. The purpose of this paper is to create a database for reconstruction in old cities and planning of new smart cities. Results suggest that urban sprawl and substitution of rural areas with impervious surface plays significant role in microclimate, causing formation of new thermal hotspots. The analysis of urban thermal environment and its dynamics is to provide a scientific basis for future strategy building.

TI  - Allusive and Ekphrastic Novel by L. M. Leonov "Russian Forest"
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The given article deals with an important feature of the poetic pattern of Leonov's literary texts: inter textual intensity, the use of allusive words in the narration. There is an intensive use of the "alien word" in the novel "Russian Forest" ("Russkiy les"). The source of allusions in the novel is quite extensive: the Bible, ancient mythology, history, fairy tales, works of world fiction, etc. While referring to Leonov's novel "Russian Forest", it is next to impossible to notice a variety of external and hidden, deep literary reminiscences, allusive and ekphrastic elements bringing the image of Leonov to a certain tradition. The names of famous philosophers and eminent figures of different epochs, associations with the images of Russian writers, references to archipopular and little-known literary works, poetic quotations saturating Leonov's text reveal spiritual aspirations and strengthen the life philosophy of the characters of the "Russian Forest" and form Leonov's thoughts into a single and indivisible physical and the spiritual world. The purpose of the article is to analyze the manifestation of allusions in the novel by Leonov "Russian Forest", to reveal the forms of allusive and ekphrastic elements and to determine their role in the novel. The associative and ekphrastic elements in Leonov's text fulfill the function of overcoming the one-dimensionality of the novel content. The transformation of the figurative system with the help of ekphrasis fills it up with a philosophical, historical and cultural sense highlighting the writer's idea of the symbolic. Myth and symbol in the novel "Russian Forest" are the main means of expressing the author's literary philosophy. Besides, the article in question touches upon a problem of arts fusion in Leonov's works, in particular synthesis of literature, painting and music as well as a problem of relation between the visual, musical and verbal. It is necessary to note that Leonid Leonov appears as a writer with a clear visualization of the worldview and a poetic word accordingly. As for musical associations, they create a unique musical background that helps the writer reveal characters' temper and their psychological conditions.

TI  - THE VALUE COMPONENT IN THE BURYAT WORLDVIEW AND LANGUAGE USE: TRANSFORMATION FEATURES AT BILINGUALISM
T2  - TOMSKII ZHURNAL LINGVISTICHESKIKH I ANTROPOLOGICHESKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-TOMSK JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of Buryat value system, features of its transformation in the conditions of growing number of the Buryat-Russian bilinguals, mother tongue loss in Buryats. The data for the study came from the free associative experiment made among the Buryat bilinguals in both. native and Russian language, comparative analysis of the materials of "The Russian associative dictionary", the data of the ethnopsychological research by I. E. Elaeva conducted earlier, and the available data on word frequency in the classic of the Buryat literature by Kh. Namsaraev. The research demonstrates the degree of stability of Buryat value system. The comparative analysis shows that the most high-frequency words are national, most significant lexemes. For the Buryat, the patrimonial relations are important, which is demonstrated by the preservation even in Russian-speaking respondents of such word-responses as mother, relatives, children and father. Traditional value dominants are life, house, homeland, sun, body, work, food, book, thought. The data also show that the distinctive feature of the Buryat consciousness is the appreciation of the teacher and guest. The most significant word-responses designating qualitative characteristics are: hayn 'good, kind', khuney 'human', sagaan 'white', seber 'pure', goyo 'elegant, beautiful', turgen 'fast', haykhan 'beautiful', buryad 'Buryat', dulaan 'warm'. "The love to the country, to the people" is confirmed by entry into high-frequency group of such responses in the domain "person" as: arad and zon 'people'; in the domain "realia" -nyutag 'homeland', in the domain "quality evaluations" -burayd 'Buryat'. The analysis of comparative constructions also shows that the major value category for Buryat nomads is the nature. The comparative analysis of basic value components of the Buryat language use shows that the influence of Russian language is mainly reflected in a so called "real" environment. It is also established that the influence of a national language code remains rather high, which respectively, also maintains such key Buryat cultural, social consciousness features as emphasizing being peaceful, unaggressive.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Conference on Word, Utterance, Text - Cognitive, Pragmatic and Cultural Aspects (WUT)
CL  - Chelyabinsk State Univ, RUSSIA
AB  - The article emphasizes the necessity of studying the categories of linguistic consciousness by taking into consideration the three-component structure of the categorial system put forward by philosophers (instead of the previously proposed two-component model): the essence of the world, the essence of consciousness and the essence of the relationship between consciousness and matter. In this regard, special emphasis is given to artifact categories which represent such linguo-mental phenomena, which are created directly by human consciousness under the influence of continuously emerging knowledge, and which organize the world of objects surrounding man in accordance with these categories created by consciousness. For example, the linguo-mental phenomenon of TOY gives us an opportunity to analyze the substantive, structural and functional specificity of some artifact categories. The word association experiment held among native Russian speakers aged from 4 to 65, reveals the cognitive-propositional structure of the categories under study. By introducing the concept of framework categories, preserving the general characteristics but changing their specific content and the reference area under the influence of subjective factors (such as age, psychological factors, etc.) it is possible to show the essence, specificity of the content structure, and the dynamic nature of framework categories.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active remote sensing technique capable of providing high-resolution imagery independent from daytime and to great extent unimpaired by weather conditions. Unlike the passive remote sensing active radars receive its' own reflected signal. Features of received signal make able to obtain additional information about surface objects and covers. Because of signal, double reflecting upon vertical surfaces like walls, it become common to study urbanized areas using SAR data. Because of mostly similar spectral characteristic of the typical buildings' roofs and sandy soils, that are distinguishing for Morocco, classification using visible and NIR multispectral remote sensing data is complicated. Thus, SAR data processing technique is rather useful while application to deserted area studying and urbanized areas identification.

AB  - Nowadays, Moroccan oasis agro-ecosystems are under intense effect of natural and anthropogenic factors. Therefore, this essay proposes to use Leaf Area Index (LAI) to assess the consequences of the oases long-term biodegradation. The index was used as a widely-applied parameter of vegetation structure and an important indicator of plant growth and health. Therefore, a new optical multispectral Sentinel-2 data were used to build a long term LAI time series for the area of the Erfoud and Rissani oases, Errachidia province in Draa-Tafilalet region in Morocco. Nine images of LAI spatial distribution over the study area were obtained by means of SNAP Biophysical Processor over the period since July 2015 till May 2018. Time series analysis of the resultedmaps has revealed a stable trend towards the average LAI decreasing and vegetation structure simplification as a consequence.

AB  - Cloud cover ratio in electro-optical satellite images is a critical factor for the usability of the images. First step to assess the usability of satellite images is cloud detection for the estimation of a cloud coverage from the analyses and/or removing the clouds from images. Satellite imagery providers supply these cloud ratio and maps for their satellite imagery. In this work, classification-based and rule-based methods are compared for cloud detection in high-resolution satellite imagery. In particular, test images consist of different scenarios such as regular, stereo and cloudy imagery. From the experiments, it has been observed that deep learning-based methods could achieve significant cloud detection performances.

AB  - Results from the Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2) prelaunch spectral characterization at telescope and detector subsystem level are presented. The derived relative spectral response (RSR) shape is expected to be very similar to the instrument-level spectral response and provides an initial estimate of the RSR and its differences to the component-level RSR measurements. Such differences were observed at TIRS-1 and are likely a result of angular dependence of the spectral response of the detector. The subsystem RSR measurements also provide an opportunity for a preliminary assessment of the spectral requirements. Final requirements verification will be performed at future thermal vacuum environmental testing with the fully assembled TIRS-2 instrument.

T2  - TRANSPORTATION LETTERS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Transportation infrastructure and urban development are tightly connected and interact with each other. The objective of this paper is to measure the impact of large-scale transportation infrastructure locations on land cover. Spatial econometric models that link the impact of transportation infrastructure onto the urban evolution have been used with panel data (multiple time points). Land cover information was derived individually from two Landsat TM images (1984 and 2010) by applying a semi-automatic object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach, resulting in six generalized thematic categories. Data from multiple databases have been collected and cross-referenced. The study area is the Athens metropolitan area, Greece, where, during the last few decades, crucial transportation infrastructure has been developed and significant urbanization has been observed. Moreover, a fixed effects model has been developed for a study area, providing additional information for the differences across municipalities. The results of this research provide evidence toward the quantification of the impact of major road transportation infrastructure in urban development and can have applications in other areas that have not been yet fully developed.

The paper explores language tools that actualize the randomness of the things enumeration and the linearity of memories. It also deals with the socio-cultural space of the narration and the author's modality, objectified through the quality of the things, in terms of semantics of the oppositions. The author focuses on the meanings representing absurdity and the discord with reality as a norm of creative person's life. The study identifies main semantic oppositions of the work: Soviet anti-Soviet, freedom - lack of freedom, intelligence - non-intellectualism, man beast, prince - beggar, etc. Investigating the artistic discourse through the image of object (thing) the author reconstructs fragments of the conceptual worldview.

T2  - MSMR
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This report uses routinely collected data in the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS) to explore the period prevalence of polypharmacy among the active component U.S. military in 2016. The period prevalence across the Department of Defense was 10.8% and was highest for the Army (14.5%) and lowest for the Marine Corps (7.4%). Furthermore, a case control study was conducted to explore the potential association between polypharmacy and incident suicidal ideation (SI). There was an increased adjusted odds of incident SI within 12 months following polypharmacy exposure, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.53 (95% CI, 1.38-1.71) to 3.06 (95% CI, 2.00-4.70), depending on the number of qualifying polypharmacy criteria. Important limitations to the current analysis are discussed. Results suggest that it would be prudent to screen for SI during the polypharmacy clinical encounter, particularly for persons with any of the mental health disorders considered in this report. Inclusion of Department of Defense Suicide Event Report data along with medically coded SI in future surveillance would increase the sensitivity of identifying incident cases of SI.

AB  - The objective of the present paper is to develop an operational approach for soil moisture mapping in agricultural areas at a high spatial resolution over bare soils, as well as soils with vegetation cover. The developed approach is based on the synergic use of radar and optical data and uses the neural network technique to invert the radar signal. Three inversion SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) configurations were tested: (1) VV polarization, (2) VH polarization, and (3) both VV and VH polarization, all in addition to the NDVI information extracted from optical images. Neural networks were developed and validated using synthetic and real databases. The results showed that the soil moisture could be estimated in agricultural areas with an accuracy of approximately 5 vol.%.

AB  - Digital Image Processing (DIP) plays a vital role in the analysis and interpretation of remotely sensed data. It forms core research area within engineering and computer science disciplines too. This paper describes a proposal design for image processing in Verilog and that can be applied for any format of images like jpg, gif, bmp etc. The main advantage of using Verilog to simulate DIP of any logical inputs is related with the possibility of an immediate FPGA based hardware implementation. Our algorithm is designed in Verilog and simulated using the Matlab and Modelsim. In fact, the input image is converted to text/pixel using Matlab and results are stored in a new text file. Using Verilog with test bench program, the inputs, outputs and memory locations are assigned in the form of text file. Then, the output texts file back to image after a conversion step using Matlab. A comparative study between HDLs Simulation and Matlab are conducted. Obtained results show well the efficiency of the proposed design. As an extension of this work, we aim to implement an efficient FPGA based hardware design for a set of image processing, enhancement, and filtering algorithms.

AB  - This research will be further developed with the integration of high resolution remote sensing data, aerial photographs, ground surveys and meteorological data to better define the functional models for these hazardous processes in the Sebou River basin with special emphasis on desertification and land degradation.The physico-chemical characteristics of groundwater of the aquifer system contained in the plio-quaternary geological of the gharb (Morocco) indicate that a hydrochemical diversity exists depending on the nature of the aquifer, which itself related to the lithology in this semi-arid zone of Morocco.The salinity of water increases, following a W-E section going from the coastal zone towards the centre, South East and North East of the basin. In the centre and East, the shallow aquifer exhibits cation and anion values going beyond the morocco norm of drinking water. This salinity is due to the abundance of under ground salty domes. The deep aquifer protected by a layer of clay more or less thick presents water of good quality except for the coastal zone where the deep formations appear. Hence, the irrational use of fertilizers influences the geochemical zoning system.These deductions are based on preliminary studies to determine the principal water-rock interactions which control the composition of groundwater of the Plio-quaternary aquifer of the Gharb and to identify the natural process and the human impact which influence the hydrochemical zoning of this semi-arid zone of north-west of Morocco.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in patients with breast cancer with clinically negative axillary nodes is an innovative technique in the management of the axilla. SLN biopsy has been performed using different techniques including injection of patent blue dye, radioactive colloid, and recently methylene blue dye. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of methylene blue dye as a mapping agent for SLN biopsy in clinically axillary node-negative breast carcinoma.Patients and methodsBetween January 2014 and October 2016, 50 female patients with established diagnosis of breast carcinoma by tru-cut biopsy and clinically negative ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes were included in the study. All the patients were operated upon in Ain Shams University hospitals. After induction of anesthesia, 3-5 ml of sterile 1% methylene blue was infiltrated into the subareolar tissue on the affected side. The lymph nodes receiving the blue dye were excised as the SLN. Excised specimen with the axillary tissue was sent for histopathological examination. The presence or absence of metastasis in SLN and axillary lymph nodes was compared. Statistical analysis was carried out to know sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of SLN biopsy in breast cancer.ResultsThe incidence of breast cancer was highest at 41-50 years. Of our 50 cases, SLN was identified in 44 cases using methylene blue dye. The identification rate was 88%. None of the patients had negative SLN but positive axillary lymph nodes (false negative), and in six cases, SLNs were involved only but not the rest of the axilla (false positive). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 100, 85.7, 25, and 100%, respectively.ConclusionThis study confirms the safety and efficacy of methylene blue dye as a mapping agent for SLN biopsy in axillary node-negative breast cancer.

AB  - The paper describes the granulometric characteristics of the large accumulation form sediments (the Anapa Bay-bar). The choice of sampling sites was based on remote sensing data. The analysis of particle size change in 2012 to 2016 has been carried out. The content of carbonate and mineral components in samples collected on the submerge slope has been determined. When comparing the data of 2012 and 2015, it is clear that size structure and composition of sand have not been changed significantly. Analysis of zoobenthos samples shows that the increase in shelly material content is not directly related to the increase in the living mollusks biomass. Sand with a mean particle size of at least 0.3 mm should be used to nourish beaches of the Anapa bay-bar. Smaller material will be washed out to deeper depths or blown away to dunes.

AB  - Due to the rapid change in technologies, new data forms exist which lead to a huge data size on the internet. As a result, some learning platforms such as e-learning systems must change their methodologies for data processing to be smarter. This paper proposes a framework for smoothly adapt the traditional e-learning systems to be suitable for smart cities applications. Learning Analytics (LA) has turned into a noticeable worldview with regards to instruction of late which embraces the current progressions of innovation, for example, cloud computing, big data processing, and Internet of Things. LA additionally requires a concentrated measure of preparing assets to create applicable investigative outcomes. Be that as it may, the customary methodologies have been wasteful at handling LA difficulties.

T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th International Conference on Fog, Fog Collection and Dew
CL  - Univ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, POLAND
AB  - An innovative set of six observed predictors of fog formation by radiative cooling is proposed, which describes: 1) one of the main processes of fog formation that is the water uptake by aerosols at surface level; 2) the fog development along the vertical up to 30 meters, as well as the cloud cover; and 3) the temporal evolution of the parameters describing the water uptake by aerosols and the cloud cover. The visibility is used as a signal of atmospheric and surface processes affecting the water uptake by aerosols. The vertical fog development is described by the vertical thermal gradient along a 30-m meteorological mast. The cloud cover is described using a ceilometer for low and middle clouds above the instrument, and satellite data for clouds in a pixel and in a larger 9 x 9-pixel region around the site. The set of predictors can be observed in operational conditions, such as on airport fields. Data acquired at the SIRTA platform (Paris, France) during two autumns and two winters were analysed, and the cloud cover classification derived from the SEVIRI instrument on the METEOSAT Second Generation satellite by the EUMETSAT/NWCSAF program was also utilized. The training data set was acquired in November 2011 while the validation data set extended over 12 months.All situations were discriminated between favourable and unfavourable scenarii of radiative cooling fog formation, with a factor of 10 in probability. 246 moderate visibility events (with visibility between 5 and 10 km) were observed under a clear sky in 12 months at SIRTA. While developed fog formed according to one scenario, thin fog formed according to six scenarii. On the contrary to thin fog, developed fog did not form when cirrus clouds were observed above moderate visibility situations. The fog formation probability varied from 12 to 43%, and even reached 100% for one thin fog. As the training data set was acquired in autumn, the predictor set seems more appropriate to nowcast fog in humid autumn conditions, when the fog formation probability was multiplied by similar to 2. The predictive set could be enriched by predictors proposed in literature, and tests suggest that relative humidity would improve the fog formation probability in winter. Five predictors identify 65 of the 217 no-fog events counted in 12 months, with similar to 3 h anticipation time. If visibility decreased below 5 km, 88 additional no-fog events were identified. In this case, the formation probability was 35% for developed fog, and 24-60% for thin fog, but with an anticipation time reduced to similar to 1.5 h. Only one fog, which represents 3% of the fog events, would be missed with such a predictive scheme.

T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The artide focuses on the film script for Hitlerjunge Quex (1933, director Hans Steinhoff) written by B.E. Luthge and K.A. Schenzinger. This film is an example of the national socialist propaganda cinematograph at work. The case study discusses the strategies of the child figure instrumentalization for ideological purposes. It draws parallels between the Nazi art and the Soviet art, cinema in particular where similar propaganda models are present, such as the cult of heroic pioneers. The narrative about the heroic deed and martyrdom of the young Nazi has much in common the story about Pavlik Morozov, popular in the Soviet time. The paper deals with ideologemes that unite the "child heroes" constructs in both totalitarian cultures: the myth about the impartiality and Innocence" of the child's worldview, acclaimed superiority of the public welfare over family relations and others. It also studies the sources of such ideologetnes, their connection with Christian, Enlightenment and other belief systems.

AB  - The perspectives applied to any construct, like leadership, are fundamentally determined by the worldview (or ontology) adopted to frame those perspectives. Given the importance of leadership, a true leader is not one with the most followers, but one who develops leaders. They can only do that if they know the uniqueness of those they lead. The value of unearthing their distinctiveness is by creating spaces of practice, enabling boldness, risk-taking, inventing, modifying, and having fun, which may identify unthought-of means to illustrate how academe can preserve the spontaneity, humor, wisdom, and unique flavor of different perspectives in a hero's quest, a quest of discovery that inspires them to embark on their path of learning and transformation that may compel them to think in different ways that pushes them outside their comfort zone. A critical reflection on strategic leaders and their followers used to frame this construct is more than crucial, it can be a journey in out-thinking in the education sector.

AB  - Solar resource availability and variability are important aspects of monitoring performance of photovoltaic installations. For example, recent degradation studies have highlighted the importance of considering cloud cover when calculation degradation rates. With this in mind, we present a method for optimizing clear sky detection algorithms given only modeled clear sky irradiance and ground-measured irradiance values. This method is tested on global horizontal irradiance (GM) data from ground collectors at six sites across the US and was trained against clear sky classifications determined from satellite data. Thirty models were optimized on each individual site at GHI data frequencies of 1, 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes. The models had an average F-0(.5) score of 0.945 +/- .021 on a holdout test set. In comparison, the un-optimized clear sky detection algorithm produced F-0(.5) score that averaged to 0.707 +/- 0.187.

M3  - Article
AB  - Critics remain divided over the moral of The Road. Is McCarthy's post-apocalyptic novel a Christian allegory, a critique of capitalism, or a meditation on the indifference of the universe? While all these accounts have their merits, this article argues that an investigation of the historical and cultural setting of The Road and a detailed reading of the novel's conclusion demonstrate that The Road is a didactic novel, laying out direct ethical imperatives. Through an analysis of the dream of the cave with which the novel begins and ends, we show that there never was any possibility of returning to the world or worldview of the novel's father, a worldview defined by an ethos of individual survival over communal sharing. Hence, in the figure of the son, McCarthy develops an ethos toward community and the alleviation of suffering, one that the novel suggests might be the only hope for humans at the end of the world.

M3  - Article
AB  - The 590 km(2) of the Western Rif (North of Morocco) is well known for active mass movements due to the strong climatic and anthropogenic aggressions in this area, where lithology and topographic relief are likely the phenomena that cause slope instability problems. In this study, we have focused on mass movements that have been occurred in the last two decades, namely landslides, complex slides and block slides. Over the years, this site and its surroundings have experienced repeated landslides. For this reason, landslides susceptibility mapping is mandatory to prevent natural risk and to better manage land-use. The application of weight of evidence method using remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) were used to generate a susceptibility map. Six conditioning factors were used in this study: lithology, distance to faults, distance to drainage, slope, aspect and hypsometry. A total of 126 mass movements locations were detected; 63 landslide location (50%) were randomly selected as input data for the entire process using the spatial data model (SDM) and the remaining locations were used for validation purposes. The final map of areas susceptible to mass movements has an accuracy of 95.3% and has been classified into four classes (very high, high, moderate and low).

AB  - Water scarcity is one of the main challenges facing water management in Egypt. This in turn will have direct impacts on the agricultural sector which is a key sector for the socio-economic development in Egypt, and plays a significant role in the Egyptian national economy. In Egypt, water resources are limited to the Nile River, rainfall, deep groundwater, and potential desalination of sea. Climate change, rapid population growth, and economic development will significantly affect the future availability of water resources for agriculture sector, which consumes about 85% of total water resources in Egypt. Therefore, continuously monitoring of crop statutes and crop water consumption plays a vital role in water resources management in developing countries such as Egypt. Recently Remote sensing techniques provide decision makers with spatial information about crop statutes and water stress at region scale. Remote sensing techniques also have the ability to monitor large areas with saving time and cost. The main objective of this study is investigating the capabilities of satellite data in monitoring of water stress and crop statues in the central portion of Nile delta by using the water stress index (WSI). The water stress index was used to identify locations of poor irrigation in order to maximize the crop yield. The proposed model was calibrated and validated against the measured data by using 20 points of ground measurements for actual evapotranspiration (ETC) and wet evapotranspiration (ETWet). The performance of the model was measured using various evaluation criteria. Validation results showed that satellite data are capable of estimating WSI since the comparison between WSIobs and WSIest resulted in R-2 =0.5003. Therefore WSI can be considered as a quick, costless and moderate tool to provide farmers and decision makers with spatial information about crop statues and water stress.

AB  - This research is concerned with detecting the depths of the Aswan High Dam Lake (AHDL) (particularly Nubia Lake) using Landsat-8 multi-spectral bands with resolution 30m. The method of depths estimating from the satellite images is based on establishing Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model using logarithms of reflectance bands. Quantifying the error between in situ measurements and satellite estimated lake depths values. The results indicated that the correlation coefficient (R=0.5) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE= 0.6m) for testing data set. The computed depths from the satellite remote sensing data were used to estimate the sediment and erosion capacities in Lake Nubia (LN) since the beginning of the storage process in the lake at the year 1964 till the year 2012. The results are comparable to those of the traditional method (cross section method) and the method of building 3D profile from the field measurements with additional merits of the present approach that it is more flexible and cost-effective tool for bathymetry mapping. Moreover, the results indicated that the computed amount of sediment using the estimated depths from the RS data (the present approach) overestimated the results by 4.16% compared to those computed using the cross-section method adopted by AHDA. On the other hand, the results indicate that the present approach overestimates sediment amount by about 3.93% compared to the results derived from the generated 3D profiles of the Lake based on the field measurements.

AB  - The main problem in wind retrieval using SAR imagery is the lack of the wind direction information. A few methods have been proposed to extract the wind direction from SAR images. The main limitation of these methods is the 180 degrees ambiguity in the direction. Usually, an external source of wind direction is used to remove this ambiguity. This study exploits the Along-track Interferometric SAR (ATI-SAR) phase to demonstrate its usefulness to tackle this problem. A method is proposed to remove the wind direction ambiguity using the ATI-SAR phase information. This is based on the fact that the interferometric phase is related to the sea surface motion direction. Depending on the sign convention, the phase is positive/negative for advancing/receding target respectively. This effect is used to assist the wind extraction algorithm to select the most plausible direction. The results show a very good agreement with atmospheric model and visual investigation.

TI  - A comparative evaluation of arid inflow-dependent vegetation maps derived from LANDSAT top-of-atmosphere and surface reflectances
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - In remote sensing, it is commonly accepted that land remote-sensing satellite (LANDSAT) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance is less accurate than atmospheric correction (AC) reflectance, as the former is not calibrated for possible modifications in the electromagnetic radiation signals due to atmospheric scattering and absorption. This article investigates whether LANDSAT data calibrated for TOA reflectance are an appropriate information source for delineating inflow-dependent vegetation (IDV) in regions with an arid and desert climate, such as the Pilbara region in Western Australia. Knowledge of where IDVs are in the landscape underpins planning their protection and define the baseline for their monitoring when water resource management options are considered. The appropriateness of TOA calibration for the delineation of IDV in the Pilbara was assessed through its comparison with IDV maps derived from AC reflectance. Both radiometric calibration methods (TOA and AC) were applied to a multi-date LANDSAT 5 TM (Thematic Mapper) dataset of 10 images acquired in 2009 and 2010. Two methods based on the application of remote-sensing techniques to identify the extent of temporally invariant vegetation were applied for IDV delineation in the study area. The first method, groundwater-dependent ecosystems mapping (GEM), employs a two-date normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset for identifying no-change clusters of land cover and detecting those related to IDV. The second method applies principal component analysis (PCA) to a multi-date NDVI dataset. The first principal component (PC1) typically contains features that remain unchanged over time. This includes vegetation with continuous or frequent access to surface and/or groundwater, such as IDV. To delineate the extent of IDV, a thresholding technique was further employed. Spatial similarity between IDV maps produced from TOA and AC reflectance was quantitatively evaluated by the Kappa coefficient. The results showed that TOA and AC IDV maps are in almost perfect agreement with the Kappa values above 0.83. This suggests that TOA reflectance is equally appropriate to AC reflectance for mapping in arid and desert climate such as in Pilbara. When the GEM- and PCA-based methods are applied in other study areas with arid or desert climate, the accuracy of the delineated IDV extent may vary. Therefore, the results need to be validated using ground-truth information about known IDV occurrences in the area of interest. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods have always posed great threat to human settlements, and their monitoring has always been a very important step in the understanding, managing and predicting similar, future events, in order to mitigate flood risk and the concrete impact it has on communities and the environment. Modern techniques of analysing flood extent include remote sensing, by extracting flood limits from satellite imagery, and Geographical Information Systems (GIS), which are used in tandem, to generate cartographic material, depicting areas suffering from flood damage. Unfortunately, the results are not always precise, and can induce significant errors, due to which, the results are questionable and cannot be efficiently included in management plans, by authorities. The current study addresses the validation process of digitally generated GIS layers, based on statistical data derived from hydrological field recordings, with satellite images that reveal the proper flood extents, from the same time period, as the case study flash flood. The emphasis was put on comparing absolute and relative accuracy values, in order to validate several results, such as digital, HEC-RAS generated water levels (based on statistical analysis) with recorded water levels; 5% recurrence interval flood extents of HEC-RAS model, correlated withreal-world flood extent, and through satellite imagery.

TI  - Multi-kernel deconvolution for contrast improvement in a full field imaging system with engineered PSFs using conical diffraction
T2  - OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of restoration of a high-resolution image from several degraded versions of the same scene (deconvolution) has been receiving attention in the last years in fields such as optics and computer vision. Deconvolution methods are usually based on sets of images taken with small (sub-pixel) displacements or slightly different focus. Techniques based on sets of images obtained with different point-spread-functions (PSFs) engineered by an optical system are less popular and mostly restricted to microscopic systems, where a spot of light is projected onto the sample under investigation, which is then scanned point-by-point. In this paper, we use the effect of conical diffraction to shape the PSFs in a full-field macroscopic imaging system. We describe a series of simulations and real experiments that help to evaluate the possibilities of the system, showing the enhancement in image contrast even at frequencies that are strongly filtered by the lens transfer function or when sampling near the Nyquist frequency. Although results are preliminary and there is room to optimize the prototype, the idea shows promise to overcome the limitations of the image sensor technology in many fields, such as forensics, medical, satellite, or scientific imaging.

TI  - Direct normal irradiation-based approach for determining potential regions for concentrated solar power installations in Morocco
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMBIENT ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, potential sites for concentrated solar power (CSP) installations in Morocco are investigated based on direct normal irradiation (DNI). The DNI data of four Moroccan sites (Missour, Erfoud, Zagora and Tantan) were collected from different satellite databases (NASA SSE, PV GIS-Helioclim, Climate-SAF PVGIS and Solar Med Atlas). However, it is required to mitigate the risks resulting from uncertainties of satellitebased irradiation data by combining satellite data to ground measurements of at least 1 year. The ground-measured data reported in this work are collected from MHP and MDI meteorological stations installed by IRESEN in collaboration with DLR and ONEE in the framework of the enerMENA project. The Liu and Jordan and the Collares Pereira and Rabl models were also used to determine the monthly and yearly average hourly DNI values. The results of this study suggest that Missour, Erfoud and Zagora represent potential sites for CSP power plants installations, except for Tantan.

TI  - Welfare Chauvinism in Populist Radical Right Platforms: The Role of Redistributive Justice Principles
T2  - SOCIAL POLICY & ADMINISTRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Welfare chauvinism has become an important element in the agenda of the populist radical right. This article proposes a novel argument to explain variation in the strength of welfare chauvinist appeals across social policy programmes. It theorizes that the redistributive justice principles (equity, equality, and need) that underpin a social programme matter. Equality- and need-based programmes are more likely to contradict a nativist worldview in principle or practice, whereas equity-based schemes are less vulnerable to welfare chauvinistic appeals. As a consequence, welfare chauvinism should be targeted at social policies that provide universal or means-tested benefits. Insurance-based systems are more likely to be immune. This argument is tested through a qualitative content analysis of populist radical right election manifestos in four West European democracies. The results show that insurance-based systems (pensions, unemployment) are less likely to attract welfare chauvinism, whereas universal healthcare and means-tested social assistance programmes are more prone to draw nativist appeals. Universal family allowances, however, are less likely to attract welfare chauvinism than predicted by the theory.

AB  - The monitoring of tropical ecosystems is complex due to the type of terrain and adverse weather conditions present during most of the year. This paper proposes the development and implementation of a methodology based on RADARSAT-2 images and a semi-empirical model to obtain surface parameters in a tropical forest.The model takes into consideration the sensor configuration, and vegetation and soil parameters to represent the behavior of the wave in the scene. To retrieve the surface parameters, the model is implemented in an optimization framework using all polarizations (HH, HV, VH and VV). Finally, as outputs of the optimization process, we obtain the trunk diameter (Dt), the crow height (hc), and the optical penetration depth (tau). By using., the vegetation water content (VWC) is estimated.The accuracy of this methodology is about 83% when compared to ground data.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ghana introduced monovalent rotavirus vaccine in April 2012. We sought to determine the long-term impact of routine rotavirus vaccination on rotavirus gastroenteritis hospitalizations in Ghana during the first 4 years following rotavirus vaccine introduction.METHODS: Active sentinel surveillance for acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations among children <5 years of age was conducted at two sites from July 2009 through June 2016. Stool specimens were collected from enrolled children and tested by enzyme immunoassay. Changes in the proportion of all-cause gastroenteritis hospitalizations due to rotavirus pre- (July 2009-June 2012) and post-vaccine introduction (July 2012-June 2016) were compared using chi-square test.RESULTS: The proportion of acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations due to rotavirus among children <5 years of age significantly declined by 42% from a pre-vaccine median of 50% (343/684) to a post-vaccine median of 29% (118/396) (p < 0.001). The age distribution of rotavirus hospitalizations shifted toward older ages with 64% (759/1197) of rotavirus hospitalizations occurring in children <12 months of age pre-vaccine introduction to 47% (212/453) occurring in children <12 months of age post-vaccine introduction (p < 0.001).DISCUSSION: The decline in rotavirus hospitalizations following rotavirus vaccine introduction have been sustained over the first 4 years of the vaccination program in Ghana. Continued vaccination against rotavirus will ensure that this burden remains low.

AB  - The technology of on-ground data processing from the Russian EO systems allowing geocoding images of the Earth's surface with a specified accuracy in case of an abnormal mode of the satellite measuring systems is considered. This technology is based on two-stage refinement of the rigorous model of the image geocoding using the coordinates of characteristic objects recognized on the analyzed and reference images. At the first stage, significant errors in the geolocation using the reference image of the Earth's surface obtained from the Landsat-8 satellite images are eliminated. At the second stage, the parameters of survey model are refined using the coordinates of individual reference objects geocoded with an accuracy of 5-10 m. The features of building of the reference information databank are considered. The algorithm SURF implemented on GPU is proposed to use for rapid and reliable identification of the same name objects at the first stage of the model refinement. The filtering of falsely identified of the same objects is carried out using statistical analysis. The examples of practical implementation of the developed technology for processing of the data from the satellites Kanopus-V and Resurs-P are presented.

AB  - The EONav ship routing service uses near real time observations of ocean surface currents, waves, wind and sea ice conditions, in conjunction with forecasts from numerical weather and ocean models, to plan the optimal route for a vessel.Products from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and several national weather services are used together with in-house products developed for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from satellites such as Sentinel-1, Radarsat-2 and COSMO-SkyMed.A novel data selection algorithm automatically ranks the various data sets and combines them to provide the most reliable met-ocean information. A sail plan optimized e.g. to reduce fuel consumption is determined based on the met-ocean information and is communicated to the ships to assist captains in selecting the best route and speed pattern to their destination.

AB  - Progress in sensor technology leads to an ever-increasing amount of remote sensing data which needs to be classified in order to extract information. This big amount of data requires parallel processing by running parallel implementations of classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), on High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. Tomorrow's supercomputers will be able to provide exascale computing performance by using specialised hardware accelerators. However, existing software processing chains need to be adapted to make use of the best fitting accelerators. To address this problem, a mapping of an SVM remote sensing classification chain to the Dynamical Exascale Entry Platform (DEEP), a European pre-exascale platform, is presented. It will allow to scale SVM-based classifications on tomorrow's hardware towards exascale performance.

AB  - Fragmentariness of the picture of the world in majority modern students is a significant obstacle in the development of their scientific worldview. The lack of integrity of the image of the universe is aggravated by the prevalence of the clip-on thinking among students, which prevents the students from fully acquiring fundamental classical education. The formation of an integral scientific picture of the world is necessary for the realization of an independent productive research activity. In whatever field this activity is carried out, it is closely related to the creation of spatial representations and the mental manipulation of them in the process of solving various problems. Spatial representations are ordered in the mind of the learner on the basis of the geometric component of the natural science picture of the world. Integrated content courses such as "Introduction to the Modern Geometry of the Universe" while teaching of students should be combined with the implementation of the principle of interdisciplinary integration in the development of the educational program, carried out on the basis of the geometric component of the natural-science picture of the world.

AB  - We compare the results of observations and numerical simulation of the ozone-content variability in the atmosphere above Nizhny Novgorod for the winters 2015 and 2016. The data of the local ground-based measurements and the MERRA reanalysis, the satellite data (SBUV device), and the numerical-simulation results are used. The analysis of the results demonstrates similar patterns of the ozone-content variability for all data sources. The stable altitude maximum in the middle stratosphere with the short-term intervals of ozone-density increase is observed. Using the numerical-analysis data allows one to estimate the influence of the photochemical and dynamic factors on the observed ozone-content variability in the winter months in the atmosphere above Nizhny Novgorod.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the article analyzes the changes in the perception in the Russian population of the images of aborigines of Yugra, which were due to the historical memory, socio-cultural processes during the colonization of Siberia and the peculiarities of the worldview of our predecessors.Objective: to reveal the features of the sociocultural evolution of the images of the population of Yugra. The achievement of this objective is possible in solving a number of important tasks. How has the historical past led to the formation of indigenous population? What were the main characteristics of these images? How and why did the images of the population of Yugra change? And finally, how the transformation of the subjective perception of objective realities depends on the historical memory?Research materials: are based on the research of written historical sources about the past of Yugra and its adjacent territories from the Middle Ages to the early of XX century; the subjects of the research are changes in the mass perception of ethnic stereotypes; achievements of history, imagology, sociology, anthropology and literary criticism are used as methodological foundations.Results and novelty of the research: the article analyzed the generation and sociocultural evolution of images of the indigenous population of Yugra as they were reflected in "European", "Russian" consciousness; fixed changes in their perception: gradual shift of attention from negative and eschatological assessments to positive and attractive features. In the same time, the dominance of stereotypes set by the previous cultural experience or introduced from the outside remained. Aborigines were habitually perceived as not quite capable subjects with externally initiated activity. To the turn of XIX-XX centuries the domestic thought continued inversion permutations in the awareness of aborigines. Their images, even though they underwent another transformation, have not been able to get out of the previous image and achieve qualitatively different compliance with presented objects.

AB  - Tracking crop's biophysical parameters using temporal Pol-SAR (Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Data) data is an active research topic in precision agriculture due to the sensitivity of PolSAR acquisition to canopy's physical and geometrical structure. Reconstruction of polarimetric features from collection of SAR data is computationally expensive, and more important, the inter-features correlations cause decreased performance in regression based biophysical parameter estimation. With the scope of operational crop monitoring, this study provides key variables to drive Leaf Area Index (LAI) from polarimetric data based on global sensitivity analysis (GSA) addressing the ranking of the most influential features. We applied variance-based GSA for temporal fully-polarimetric RadarSAT-2 images acquired through the cultivation period of two crops; canola and barley. Among 20 polarimetric features, anisotropy and correlation magnitude between co-polar channels were found to be the most influential polarimetric features for canola and barley, respectively.

AB  - The upcoming suite of Sentinel satellites in combination with their free and open access data policy will open new perspectives for establishing a spatially and temporally detailed monitoring of the Earth's surface. However, the capability to effectively and efficiently access, process, analyze and distribute the mass data streams from the Sentinels and high-level information products derived from them (but also from other missions such as Landsat), poses a key challenge. This is also true with respect to the necessity of flexibly adapting the processing and analysis procedures to new or changing user requirements and technical developments. Hence, the implementation of operational, modular and highly automated processing chains, embedded in powerful hard-and software environments and linked with effective distribution functionalities is of central importance. This contribution introduces the Urban Thematic Exploitation Platform (Urban TEP) that aims at the utilization of modern information technology (ICT) functionalities and services to bridge the gap between the technology-driven Earth Observation (EO) sector and the information needs of environmental science, planning, and policy. Key components of the system are an open, web-based portal connected to distributed high-level computing infrastructures and providing key functionalities for data access, processing, analysis, and visualization, along with the possibility of a customized development and sharing of algorithms, products and services via dedicated networking and communication tools. The Urban TEP is supposed to initiate a step change in the use of EO data and geospatial analytics by enabling any interested user to easily exploit and generate thematic information on the status and development of the built environment based multi-source data collections (i.a. EO imagery, statistics, surveying, volunteered geographic information).

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is an important national strategic sector for the nutrition, employment, and development of all countries worldwide. The world is faced with the danger of starvation, especially due to the climatic changes in the recent years and global warming. Turkey is also in a region that is influenced by climate change. To provide food for the growing world population adequately and regularly, sustainable development of the agricultural sector needs to be promoted by minimising the existing risks. In this context, it is extremely important to monitor cultivated areas in the management of agricultural risks and to determine the level of effects the climate change would cause. Losses that may occur in agricultural production can be predicted earlier by using remote sensing techniques. In addition to climatic data, information on the topography and soil and land features can be collected in a GIS database, which would facilitate the development of an effective risk management model. The objective of this study was to examine the assessment and monitoring of crop-cultivated lands in Kayseri-Bunyan Province (Turkey), which was chosen as a pilot region, and predict the probable reduction in the yields that might occur due to dry seasons, plant diseases, and various disorders.

AB  - The shoreline trajectory of Damietta city, located at the Northern coast of Egypt, is dramatically subjected to significant kinematic changes. Several types of coastal measures have been applied substantially along the coastal stretch of Damietta to protect shoreline (detached breakwaters, Jetties, groins, and seawalls). This study focuses in the assessment of shoreline kinematics response due to the existence of these structures during the period from 1990 to 2015 using satellite images and geo-spatial tools. Three semi-automatic extraction techniques are initially tempted for Landsat ETM 2003 imagery namely; Iso cluster technique, threshold method, and onscreen digitizing. The shoreline variation measurement of is described for three sectors based on the allocation of the coastal measures:(1) the western sector encompassing Damietta port with two jetties; (2) the central sector including detached breakwaters; (3) the eastern portion of Damietta estuary passing through a seawall. The results show that, the shoreline has progressed by +10.0 m/year rate west of Damietta port. Behind the detached breakwaters, the shoreline has advanced by +12.0 m/year from 1999 to 2003 and then has decreased gradually to be near the stable state in 2015. The highly eroded by average rate of 78 m/year appeared at end of eastern seawall.

AB  - The Amazon River sediment discharge has been estimated at between 600 and 1200 Mt/year, of which more than 50% comes from the Solimoes River. Because of the area's inaccessibility, few studies have examined the sediment discharge spatial and temporal pattern in the upper Solimoes region. In this study, we use MODIS satellite images to retrieve and understand the spatial and temporal behaviour of suspended sediments in the Solimoes River from Peru to Brazil. Six virtual suspended sediment gauging stations were created along the Solimoes River on a 2050-km-long transect. At each station, field-derived river discharge estimates were available and field-sampling trips were conducted for validation of remote-sensing estimates during different periods of the annual hydrological cycle between 2007 and 2014. At two stations, 10-day surface suspended sediment data were available from the SO-HYBAM monitoring program (881 field SSS samples). MODIS-derived sediment discharge closely matched the field observations, showing a relative RMSE value of 27.3% (0.48 Mtday) overall. Satellite-retrieved annual sediment discharge at the Tamshiyacu (Peru) and Manacapuru (Brazil) stations is estimated at 521 and 825 Mt/year, respectively. While upstream the river presents one main sediment discharge peak during the hydrological cycle, a secondary sediment discharge peak is detected downstream during the declining water levels, which is induced by sediment resuspension from the floodplain, causing a 72% increase on average from June to September.

AB  - This study aims to propose management strategies of ventilation paths for improving urban thermal environments. For this purpose, Gimhae-si in Gyeongsangnamdo was selected as a study area. We analyzed hot spots and cool spots in Gimhae by using Landsat 8 satellite image data and spatial statistical analysis, and finally derived the vulnerable areas to thermal environment. In addition, the characteristics of ventilation paths including wind direction and wind speed were analyzed by using data of the wind resource map provided by Korea Meteorological Administration. As a result, it was found that a lot of hot spots were similar to those with weak wind such as Jinyoung-eup, Jillye-myeon, Juchon-myeon and the downtown area. Based on the analysis, management strategies of ventilation paths in Gimhye were presented as follows. Jinyoung-eup and Jillye-myeon with hot spot areas and week wind areas have a strong possibility that hot spot areas will be extended and strengthened, because industrial areas are being built. Hence, climate-friendly urban and architectural plans considering ventilation paths is required in these areas. In Juchon-myeon, where industrial complexes and agricultural complexes are located, climate-friendly plans are also required because high-rise apartment complexes and an urban development zone are planned, which may induce worse thermal environment in the future. It is expected that a planning of securing and enlarging ventilation paths will be established for climate-friendly urban management. and further the results will be utilized in urban renewal and environmental planning as well as urban basic plans. In addition, we expect that the results can be applied as basic data for climate change adaptation plan and the evaluation system for climate-friendly urban development of Gimhye.

TI  - The Origins and Meaning of Russian Anarchism
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article refutes the generally accepted belief that Hegel's system had made the most considerable influence on Russian philosophy of the 19th and 20th centuries and argues that in fact the Fichte's late religious philosophy had been more significant. The analysis of the M. Bakunin's anarchism makes it possible to assert that his conception has nothing to do with nihilism and appeared under the enormous influence of Fichte's doctrine. According to Bakunin's conception, the possibility to establish a social structure without state stems from a specific understanding of man and his destiny in the world. Like Fichte, Bakunin thinks that true Christianity gives correct understanding of man which is different from historical Christianity and is based on the principle of the identity of God and man. In accordance with the true Christianity, every man's destiny consists in revealing God with all possible plenitude, while Jesus Christ serves here as a model of the person who has already achieved this aim. This is the fact which determines the rejection of state in Bakunin's conception: as long as people are imperfect, the only way to achieve unity and harmony is external coercion, but those who reveal God within themselves will become perfect and their social life, being based on love and internal freedom, will immediately acquire harmonious form. The article demonstrates that even in his late years, when Bakunin maintained a materialistic worldview, he retained this understanding derived from Fichte's philosophy. It is shown that a close conception of man and society can be found in the views of many other Russian thinkers, in particular, in the F. Dostoevsky's and L. Tolstoy's worldview.

AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate of dynamics from the agricultural areas from geotechnologies such as geoprocessing, geographic information systems and remote sensing in the municipality of Faxinal do Soturno located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, from 1989 to 2014. A partial methodology of the realization of multitemporal mapping of the use and land cover of the municipality where water classes, field, agriculture, forest, exposed ground and shade were analyzed. For this, the software SPRING 5.2 was used in the supervised classification of images of the satellite Landsat 5 of the year 1989 and satellite Landsat 8 of the year 2014. Subsequently, the classified images passed through the process of spatial analysis through the Space Language for Algebraic Geoprocessing (LEGAL) that made it possible to show how agricultural areas. From the crossing of information it was possible to verify the following episodes: agricultural expansion, agricultural reduction and agricultural maintenance. The results show that in the 25 years as agricultural areas with expansion of their areas, this fact is strongly linked to the increase in rice production, the highest crop in the city, confirming with IBGE data. It is concluded that the results were important to confirm as current trends observed by the generation of information with the help of geotechnology tools in the municipality.

AB  - Organizations around the world have become increasingly concerned about managing for sustainability. Educating undergraduates about sustainability presents the challenge of dealing with students with limited knowledge, politicized awareness, and modest understanding of business and sustainability issues. Traditional-aged students are at a stage of deriving their own worldview on many subjects, including their place in a broader world. Equipping them to be useful professionals in the future, or even specializing in sustainability-oriented careers, requires raising their awareness of the state of the world in environmental, societal, political, and business terms. A curriculum needs to get them acquainted with what the world needs to reach a more fruitful future, as well as the strategies that the business sector can pursue for that purpose. This study reports one professor's attempt to create a comprehensive pedagogy to produce highly qualified graduates and support them in acquiring a mindset and worldview that includes cognitive skills, fundamental values, and confidence to make an appreciable impact toward a sustainable planet.

AB  - Geological mapping in desert, mountainous or densely vegetated areas are sometimes faced with many constraints. Recently several remote sensing methods are used on ASTER or LANDSAT imagery for making that task easier. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the applicability of some of these methods on Sentinel-2A images. The study, therefore, focuses on a lithological classification using these multispectral images in the south of the Tafilalet basin. To achieve this goal, two L1C level images were used. Decorelation stretch combined with the optimal index factor (OIF) and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) were the main improvements used for RGB combination images. The classifiers Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and the Maximum Likelihood classifier (MLC) have been evaluated for a most accurate classification to be used for our lithofacies mapping. The latest drawn geological maps and RGB images of false colour combinations were used to select regions of interest (ROI) as the endmembers to use for these classifiers. Obtained results showed a clear discrimination of the different lithological units of the study area. Classifications evaluation showed that the Maximum likelihood classifier is more accurate with an overall accuracy of 76% and a Kappa coefficient is 0.74. Finally, this study has shown the importance of the use of sentinel-2 multispectral images in geological mapping and has shown that the high spectral resolution of the VNIR and SWIR bands creates a synergy with the high spatial resolution for optimal lithological mapping.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar radiation (SR) data are commonly used in different areas of renewable energy research. Researchers are often compelled to predict SR at ground stations for areas with no proper equipment. The objective of this study was to test the accuracy of the artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models for estimating monthly average SR over Kurdistan Province, Iran. Input data of the models were two data series with similar longitude, latitude, altitude, and month (number of months) data, but there were differences between the monthly mean temperatures in the first data series obtained from AVHRR sensor of NOAA satellite (DS1) and in the second data series measured at ground stations (DS2). In order to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) from AVHRR sensor, emissivity of the area was considered and for that purpose normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI) calculated from channels 1 and 2 of AVHRR sensor was utilized. The acquired results showed that the ANN model with DS1, data input with R-2 = 0.96, RMSE = 1.04, MAE = 1.1 in the training phase and R-2 = 0.96, RMSE = 1.06, MAE = 1.15 in the testing phase achieved more satisfactory performance compared with MLR model. It can be concluded that ANN model with remote sensing data has the potential to predict SR in locations with no ground measurement stations.

AB  - Marine floating raft aquaculture is widely distributed along the coast of the country, which has a significant impact on the marine environment, transportation and economy. The distribution area of marine aquaculture changes dynamically with the maturity of the aquaculture. A variety of marine aquaculture types have different characteristics on different remote sensing images. GF-1/2 high space resolution optical remote sensing images have a very significant ability to monitor seaweed and kelp cultivation. GF-3 is the first commercial C-Band multi-polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite that was launched by China. The characteristics observed by both allday and all-weather observation depict significant advantages of national sea area use dynamic monitoring. GF-3 can effectively detect the distribution of shellfish cultures, but does not show any visible in optical images. The structure of marine aquaculture and remote sensing image feature are first analyzed. Then, the dynamic change of distribution area are monitored through different GF satellite data. The effectiveness of GF image are demonstrated in some major aquaculture areas.

TI  - Big Data Integration in Remote Sensing across a Distributed Metadata-Based Spatial Infrastructure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since Landsat-1 first started to deliver volumes of pixels in 1972, the volumes of archived data in remote sensing data centers have increased continuously. Due to various satellite orbit parameters and the specifications of different sensors, the storage formats, projections, spatial resolutions, and revisit periods of these archived data are vastly different. In addition, the remote sensing data received continuously by each data center arrives at a faster code rate; it is best to ingest and archive the newly received data to ensure users have access to the latest data retrieval and distribution services. Hence, an excellent data integration, organization, and management program is urgently needed. However, the multi-source, massive, heterogeneous, and distributed storage features of remote sensing data have not only caused difficulties for integration across distributed data center spatial infrastructures, but have also resulted in the current modes of data organization and management being unable meet the rapid retrieval and access requirements of users. Hence, this paper proposes an object-oriented data technology (OODT) and SolrCloud-based remote sensing data integration and management framework across a distributed data center spatial infrastructure. In this framework, all of the remote sensing metadata in the distributed sub-centers are transformed into the International Standardization Organization (ISO) 19115-based unified format, and then ingested and transferred to the main center by OODT components, continuously or at regular intervals. In the main data center, in order to improve the efficiency of massive data retrieval, we proposed a logical segmentation indexing (LSI) model-based data organization approach, and took SolrCloud to realize the distributed index and retrieval of massive metadata. Finally, a series of distributed data integration, retrieval, and comparative experiments showed that our proposed distributed data integration and management program is effective and promises superior results. Specifically, the LSI model-based data organization and the SolrCloud-based distributed indexing schema was able to effectively improve the efficiency of massive data retrieval.

AB  - Monitoring live fuel moisture content (LFMC) in Mediterranean area is of great importance for fire risk assessment. LFMC has extensively been estimated based on optical remote sensing data. But the latter can be affected by atmospheric effects. As a complementary data source, microwave data can be used as they are relatively insensitive to atmospheric effects. Yet further evaluations are needed to investigate the potential of microwave observations to monitor LFMC. In this study, we assess the capability of long-term microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD) to capture the temporal variability of in situ measured LFMC in 14 Mediterranean shrub species in southern France during 1996-2014. Microwave-derived VOD at X band (VODX-15) displayed a high sensitivity to LFMC with correlation coefficients of 0.56. Similar evaluations were made using four optical indices computed from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), visible atmospheric resistant index (VARI), normalized difference water index (NDWI). The comparisons showed that VARI performs better than VODX-15 and other optical indices with highest median of correlation coefficients of 0.65. Overall, this study shows that passive microwave-derived VOD, are efficient proxies for LFMC of Mediterranean shrub species and could be used along with optical indices to evaluate fire risks in the Mediterranean region.

TI  - A MODIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR SHIP DETECTION FROM COMPACT POLARIZATION SAR IMAGE
T2  - IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - In recent years, the compact polarimetric SAR (CP SAR) imaging mode has received much attention because of its advantages in swath width compared to the quad-polarization mode and in information of scattering targets compared to the linear dual-polarization mode, respectively. For object detection (e.g., ship, sea ice, and drilling platform) in maritime monitoring which has been widely discussed, it is still a challenge to eliminate the false alarms caused by ocean clutter. Accordingly, a modified feature-based framework for ship detection using CP SAR data was proposed in this paper. In particular, a Guard-filter was used after feature extraction to reduce the effect of ocean clutter. Several simulated CP SAR imageries based on Gaofen-3 quad-polarization SAR image were selected for further investigations on ship detection. A SVM classifier was included in the framework to do a pixel-wise classification. The result shows that the proposed method has a better performance compared to traditional methods (e.g., constant false alarm rate and polarimetric whitening filter) and the feature-based method without filtering. Overall false alarm rates are decreased by 35% with the proposed method.

TI  - PREDICTION OF LAND USE CHANGE AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES VALUE: A CASE STUDY IN NANPING, CHINA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use affect the structure, processes, and functions of ecosystems, and thus influence the ability of ecosystems to serve human beings. The prediction of land use and ecosystem services value can provide reference for the rational planning of land resources and relevant policy-making. Based on the CA-Markov model and the service value per unit area of terrestrial ecosystems in China, the area of land use types and ecosystem services value were predicted for 2030 and the corresponding countermeasures and suggestions were put forward. The study found that from 2015-2030, the area of forest land had the largest increase, while the area of land for construction had the largest decrease. The spatial distribution of land use in 2030 was predicted to be almost the same as that in 2015. The slight increase in the value of ecosystem services in 2030 was mainly due to improvement in the service capacity of waste treatment and gas regulation. The contribution rate of the service value of forest land to the total ecosystem services value was predicted to gradually decrease from 2015-2030.

TI  - Intercalibrating the MODIS and AVHRR Visible Bands Over Homogeneous Land Surfaces
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensor intercalibration has been widely performed over low-latitude deserts and circumpolar regions where surface conditions are generally well characterized. This letter proposes a new method for intercalibrating visible bands of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) over homogenous land surfaces that differ in brightness, in order to improve calibration results. The method is based on the extended simultaneous nadir overpass events. Initially, the spectral band adjustment factors are calculated using surface reflectances in the MODIS 552 and 645-nm bands. Sensor differences related to atmospheric effects are corrected using MODIS atmospheric parameters and MODIS/AVHRR sun-target-sensor geometries. In view of excellent MODIS calibration accuracy, the residual MODIS-AVHRR difference may result from AVHRR calibration bias. A preliminary validation study over radiometric sites shows <1.0% uncertainty for the high-gain calibration and <2.0% uncertainty for the low-gain calibration. The proposed method allows sensor intercalibration over varying land surfaces, and contributes to a collection of sensor calibration and intercalibration results of AVHRR sensors.

TI  - Using a MODIS Index to Quantify MODIS-AVHRRs Spectral Differences in the Visible Band
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral band differences are a critical issue for progressing into an integrated earth observation framework and in particular, in sensor intercalibration. The differences are currently normalized using spectral band adjustment factor (SBAF) that is generated from hyperspectral data. In this context, the current study proposes a method for calculating moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-advanced very high resolution radiometers (AVHRRs) SBAF in the visible band, using the MODIS surface reflectance data. The method involves a uniform ratio index calculated using the MODIS 552-nm and 645-nm bands, and a sensor-specific quadratic equation, producing SBAF data at 500-m spatial resolution. The calculated SBAFs are in good agreement at site scale with literature reported data (relative error < 1.0%), and at local scale with Hyperion-derived data (total uncertainty approximate to 0.001), and significantly improve MODIS-AVHRR surface reflectance data consistency in the visible band (better than 1.0% reflectance units). The calculation is more sensitive to atmospheric effects over the vegetated areas. At global scale, MODIS-AVHRRs SBAFs are generally large (>1.0) over densely vegetated areas and extremely low over deserts and barren lands (0.96-0.98), indicative of large MODIS-AVHRRs differences. Deserts show temporally stable SBAF values, while still suffer from intra-annual BRDF effects and short-term cloud contamination. By means of daily MODIS data, the proposed method can produce ongoing SBAF data at a spatial scale that is comparable to AVHRRs. It increases the sampling of MODIS-AVHRRs image pairs for intercalibration, and offers insight into spectral band conversion, finally contributing to an integrated earth observation at moderate spatial resolutions.

AB  - The uneven settlement of high-speed railway (HSR) brings about great threat to the safe operation of trains. Therefore, the subsidence monitoring and prediction of HSR has important significance. In this paper, an improved multitemporal InSAR method combing PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR, Multiple-master Coherent Target Small-Baseline InSAR (MCTSB-InSAR), is used to monitor the subsidence of partial section of the Beijing-Tianjin HSR (BTHSR) and the Beijing-Shanghai HSR (BSHSR) in Beijing area. Thirty-one TerraSAR-X images from June 2011 to December 2016 are processed with the MCTSB-InSAR, and the subsidence information of the region covering 56km*32km in Beijing is dug out. Moreover, the monitoring results is validated by the leveling measurements in this area, with the accuracy of 4.4 mm/year. On the basis of above work, we extract the subsidence information of partial section of BTHSR and BSHSR in the research area. Finally, we adopt the idea of timing analysis, and employ the back-propagation (BP) neural network to simulate the relationship between former settlement and current settlement. Training data sets and test data sets are constructed respectively based on the monitoring results. The experimental results show that the prediction model has good prediction accuracy and applicability.

AB  - SMAP (Soil Moisture Active/Passive) and SMOS (Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity) provide soil moisture observations that can be used for studying the global hydrological cycle, agriculture, ecology, and land atmosphere interactions. SMAP provides soil moisture at two grid scales; 36 km (which is close to its native radiometer spatial resolution) and an enhanced grid resolution of 9 km. However, these scales are not compatible with some agricultural and watershed applications that require a higher spatial resolution. This study applied a downscaling algorithm to the SMAP Level-2 radiometer 36 km product and improved the grid resolution to 1 km over the CONUS (Contiguous United States). The downscaling algorithm is built on the thermal inertial relationship between daily temperature change and averaged soil moisture modulated by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The average soil moisture and thermal inertia model functions were developed by using data from NLDAS (North America Land Data Assimilation System) and LTDR (Land Long Term Data Record) for 1981 -2016. The algorithm is applied with the 1 km MODIS Aqua LST product and the downscaled SMAP 1 km soil moisture was validated by in situ soil moisture measurements from the ISMN (International Soil Moisture Network). The validation variables show improved accuracy of the downscaled soil moisture.

TI  - Impact of Using Near Real-Time Green Vegetation Fraction in Noah Land Surface Model of NOAA NCEP on Numerical Weather Predictions
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Green vegetation fraction (GVF) is one of the input parameters of the Noah land surface model (LSM) that is the land component of a number of operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) of NOAA. The Noah LSM in current NCEP operational NWP models has been using static multiyear averages of monthly GVF derived from satellite observations of NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index. The multiyear averages of GVF are evidently not the representative of actual conditions of the land surface vegetation cover. (is study used a near-real-time (NRT) GVF data set generated from the 8-day composite of the leaf area index product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to assess the impact of NRT GVF on off-line Noah LSM simulations and NWP forecast model. Simulations of the off-line Noah LSM in the Land Information System (LIS) and weather forecasts of the NASA-Unified Weather and Research Forecasting (NUWRF) were obtained using either the static multiyear average AVHRR GVF data set or the NRT MODIS GVF while meteorological forcing data and other settings were kept the same. The off-line simulations and WRF forecasts were then compared against in situ measurements or reanalysis products to assess the impact of using NRT GVF. Improvements of both soil moisture simulations as well as forecasts of 2-meter air temperature and humidity and precipitation from NUWRF were observed using the NRT GVF data products. The RMSE in SM estimates from the off-line Noah model is reduced by around 1.0% (1.41%) during the green-up phase and by 1.48% (2.24%) over the senescence phase for the surface (root zone) SM simulations. Around 82.3% validation sites (out of 1178 sites) showed positive impact on coupled WRF model with the insertion of NRT GVF.

In this contest, we proposed a two-branch convolution network for hyperspectral image classification with a data re-sampling strategy and semi-supervised learning to address three existing problems, i.e. multi-scale feature learning, data imbalance, and small size of the dataset. The contest showed that our proposal achieved the best performance on two metrics: the overall accuracy of 77.39% and a kappa coefficient of 0.76 on the hyperspectral images provided by 2018 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.

TI  - Remote monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms using multi-source satellite data: A case of Yuqiao Reservoir, Tianjin
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, there is a growing eutrophication of surface freshwaters. In many cases, this has resulted in an increase in the occurrence and persistence of cyanobacterial blooms, not only large lakes, but also in small reservoirs. There is an urgent need for new and better monitoring approaches. Satellite based remote sensing is one important and increasing accessible tool. However, the application of MODIS and other satellite data with low spatial resolution (about 500 m) but high temporal frequency was limited to larger lakes. While with higher spatial resolution satellite data (<30 m), such as Landsat-8, have longer return periods, making them less useful for blooms monitoring. This study explores the usage of the Chinese HJ-1A\B CCD and GF-1 WFV sensors, together with the United States Landsat-8 OLI and other high-resolution satellite data for joint observation of cyanobacteria blooms in a small reservoir (Yuqiao Reservoir, Tianjin). An algal extraction was developed for each satellite sensor, and the output of different satellite sensors was evaluated. The results indicate that: (1) the combined satellite monitoring provided consistent results when compared to the visual interpretation of multiband satellite images with a mean square root error and relative error of 0.78 km(2) and 4.9%; (2) different satellite sensors provided consistent results, with an accuracy of 99.5%; (3) According to the research in 2016, the water quality of Yuqiao Reservoir was eutrophic, and algal bloom was the most serious in the two seasons of summer and autumn. The use of combined observations of high-resolution data was an effective, alternative strategy for monitoring cyanobacterial blooms in small waterbodies, opening up new possibilities to improve monitoring of these important freshwater environments.

AB  - Sukabumi coastal is the rivers outlet area for Indian Ocean. It is an area of care for the life of fish larvae. Fish Larvae can be consumed and also has a high economic value. One of the factors that affect the lives of fish larvae is the salinity conditions on waters. Salinity can be analyzed from the Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery processing using Cimandiri Algorithms. This study aims to determine and analyze the distribution of fish larvae at Sukabumi coastal and also analyze the relationship between the value of salinity with rainfall and the oceanographic conditions. Salinity values on fish larvae habitat in Sukabumi coastal ranged from 13.28 parts per thousand - 24.94 parts per thousand. The higher current movement, low rainfall, and sea in a state of low tide make salinity value increase. Otherwise, the higher rainfall, and sea in a state of low velocity tidal currents move make the salinity value decrease.

AB  - Deriving the wind surface direction is one of the key steps to retrieve other features of wind from spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). In this study first a preprocessing step in applied on the SAR image, to make the image ready for processing phase. NSCT transform is applied on the image for detecting wind direction on the next step. For wind direction estimation NSCT sub-bands that contain higher energy level, have been selected. Chosen sub-bands are clustered into different parts according to amount of energy in each pixel. The estimated wind direction has 180 degrees ambiguity, Which this problem is resolved by using the available models for wind direction estimation of SAR images. Two kinds of SAR images (1.COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) of the Italian Space Agency and 2.Sentinel-1A, VV polarization of the Strait of Bonifacio) have been analyzed and the results are compared with the model and scatterometer directions and the comparison indicated a good score of success.

TI  - Optimized fuzzy cellular automata for synthetic aperture radar image edge detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of coastline detection has been the subject of several reports. An optimized fuzzy cellular automata (FCA) algorithm for SAR image edge detection, which combines newly defined cellular automata (CAs) and fuzzy rules, is proposed. An extended Moore neighborhood is used for cellular automaton. Twelve custom masks were defined to study the edge angles of the radius two neighborhood of the main pixel. Comparing these edge angles with the radius, one neighborhood of the main pixel is useful when deciding whether or not a pixel is an edge pixel. The model was tested on two sets of images. The first dataset contained optical and simulated SAR images and the second contained an Envisat ASAR image and a ScanSAR image. A 3 x 3 Lee filter (as a preprocessing phase) was applied to each subimage containing coastlines, and the subimages were then processed using an FCA edge detector. The results were compared with those from a Sobel edge detector, Roberts edge detector, wavelet transform edge detector, and classic CA model. The results showed that the proposed method is more appropriate for edge detection of SAR images when compared with classic methods. The proposed method and wavelet transform edge detector showed good continuity, but the proposed method dealt better with speckle noise effects. (c) 2018 SPIE and IS&T

TI  - Surface albedo in different land-use and cover types in Amazon forest region
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Abstract Albedo is the portion of energy from the Sun that is reflected by the earth's surface, thus being an important variable that controls climate and energy processes on Earth. Surface albedo is directly related to the characteristics of the Earths surface materials, making it a useful parameter to evaluate the effects of original soil cover replacement due to human occupation. This study evaluated the changes in the surface albedo values due to the conversion of vegetation to other land uses and to analyze the applicability of the use of albedo in the spatial delimitation of land-use classes in the transitional region between the Cerrado and Amazon biomes. Surface albedo measurements were obtained from processing of Landsat Thematic Mapper data in the Geographic Information System (GIS), and land-use information were collected using Google Earth high-resolution images. The results show that human activities such as the cultivation of crops and burning have contributed substantially to variations in the surface albedo, and that albedo estimates from Landsat imagery have the potential to help in the recognition and delimitation of features of land use and cover.

TI  - Nature Faith and Native Faith as Integrative Spiritualities in Hungarian Ecovillages
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF RELIGION NATURE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - A basic assumption in contemporary research on religion is that religion is not an abstract system with 'neat' compartments, but a system that changes and adapts as human beings encounter, understand, interpret, and practice it. Within this basic understanding, religion scholar Marion Bowman has proposed the term 'integrative spirituality' to refer specifically to lifestyle choices that combine an eclectic mix of spiritual ideas and practices to produce highly personalized forms of religiosity. I argue that we can understand the spiritual life of Hungarian ecovillages through this lens. Ecovillages are 'intentional' communities, that is, village communities created with conscious efforts. Their inhabitants' objective is to create settlements that fit into their natural environments in the most efficient way with the least possible environmental damage. I show how Hungarian eco-village dwellers integrate green ideas, environmental philosophy, and folk-belief-especially the Central and Eastern European traditions of 'nature faith' and 'native faith'-to form a coherent religious worldview. This case study highlights the power of individuals and communities to create and re-create unique belief systems. The resulting worldview is not homogenous, but diverse and colorful.

TI  - CLASSIFICATION OF REGULAR METAPHORIC TRANSFER OF ENGLISH PHRASEOLOGICAL UNITS RELATED TO AREA OF MUSUCAL INSTRUMENTS
T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the analysis of a fragment of a conceptual worldview of the native speakers of English. It determines the conceptual areas of the designated group of functional units which have acquired the figurative meanings and names. The nature of linguistic view of the world is investigated, the correlation between metaphor and linguistic world image illustrated through the examples of the phraseological units that are considered among the phraseosemantic field "Musical Instruments" in the language under study. All the phenomena of the real world encompassing both material and ideal essences are involved into the process of metaphorization, by so doing metaphoric transfer is carried out in certain directions in a sufficiently consecutive sequence. Such transfers are called regular. In our article we differentiate seven types of regular metaphorical transfers that participate in formation of PhU with a component belonging to the topic "Musical Instruments" in the English language. The obtained distribution of the figurative meanings of PhU according to thematic groups is not final and the only possible, but it enables us to estimate the potential of this group of PhU in forming the linguistic world image of the speakers of English. The area of metaphorical meanings of this group of PhU does not all for thorough division into basic and prototypical metaphors, there exist also individual metaphoric transfers into various conceptual spheres which are based on different features.

TI  - Application of cokriging techniques for the estimation of hail size
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There are primarily two ways of estimating hail size: the first is the direct interpolation of point observations, and the second is the transformation of remote sensing fields into measurements of hail properties. Both techniques have advantages and limitations as regards generating the resultant map of hail damage. This paper presents a new methodology that combines the above mentioned techniques in an attempt to minimise the limitations and take advantage of the benefits of interpolation and the use of remote sensing data. The methodology was tested for several episodes with good results being obtained for the estimation of hail size at practically all the points analysed. The study area presents a large database of hail episodes, and for this reason, it constitutes an optimal test bench.

AB  - The Tibetan Plateau in the West of China has undergone significant changes over the last few decades as a consequence of far-reaching land-use changes and increasing effects of climate change. Numerous studies have described vegetation trends applying time-series of satellite data. However, the results of earlier studies are partly contradictory and the causal links between grassland dynamic patterns and potential drivers have not been fully understood. In this study we address this research gap by first conducting a time-series analysis based on MODIS NDVI data to derive grassland trends for the complete Tibetan Plateau. Then we apply a straightforward analysis comparing the initial grassland conditions at locations showing positive and negative vegetation trends in the surroundings of the Kekexili core protection area of the Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve where grassland degradations have been suspected due to recently increasing number of wildlife populations.The grasslands trends for the complete Tibetan plateau confirm results reported for earlier MODIS based studies, while the causal analysis showed that mostly formerly high-quality grasslands in the buffer zone of the protected areas are currently declining while positive trends can be mostly observed for areas that showed a sparse vegetation cover in 2000. This indirectly suggests a strong influence of land-use on grassland degradation as typically high-quality grasslands in the buffer zones are used for livestock keeping. These findings call for immediate management adaptations to stop currently ongoing grassland degradation in the buffer zones of the Kekexili nature reserve.

M3  - Article
AB  - The authors' understanding of neuro-programming is the result of the impact on the human brain of information and communication technology (including educational one), through which in the human brain the programs of manifestation in the ontogenesis of internal creative potentials are written. This article summarizes the history of the formation of key neuro-programming technologies of the human brain as well as proves that the changes in the society's worldview are caused by the possibilities and quality of neuro-programming technologies that society uses. Having influence over worldview stereotypes and behaviour set by the society, neuro-programming technologies essentially ensure the national security of any state and the peaceful coexistence of states in the regions and on the planet as a whole. Using historical and philosophical methods, methods of conceptualization, systematization, modeling, etc., the authors have come to the conclusion that the modern world lies in a confrontation of security strategies, in which neuro-programming technologies play a key role.

AB  - Energy conservation policy is one of the fundamental bases to take into account in the attempt of natural resources preservation nowadays. It is primarily underpinned by excessive resource exploration and uncontrolled development leading to disturbance of natural balance. In order to support the regulation of natural resource utilization there are various approaches to take into account, one of which is by using spatial approach Thus, the purpose of this study is to conduct an analysis using remote sensing methods to support a vegetation based energy conservation policy in the Special Region of Yogyakarta (DIY). On the basis of the research, it is noteworthy that the most rapidly increasing rate of energy utilization is by the general public and business actors. This is as clearly proven by an increase in the number of transportation modes of 2119575 vehicles, an increase of 6.03 % in 2017. Projected increase in the amount of fuel utilization Oil for industrial sector activities amounted to 455975425 liters or 95.26 %. The size of Green Open Space (RTH) land in recent years has not changed significantly. By using forecasting method, the projection of Green Open Space (RTH) is estimated to be 1,090.377 Ha increasing by 12.8 % in 2017. Furthermore, remote sensing analysis using Landsat 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI data indicates that land use in Yogyakarta also undergoes significant changes.

TI  - Advancing retrievals of surface reflectance and vegetation indices over forest ecosystems by combining imaging spectroscopy, digital object models, and 3D canopy modelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Imaging spectroscopy based methods offer unique capabilities for retrieving narrow-band vegetation indices which can be empirically related to functional traits of plants. However, in areas with complex topography, illumination effects affect the retrieval of such indices from high spatial resolution airborne or satellite data. Irradiance components at the pixel level are determined by atmospheric composition, as well as instantaneous illumination-surface-sensor geometries. An accurate pixel-wise description of direct and diffuse irradiance components is necessary to perform atmospheric corrections, finally resulting in improved surface reflectances and hence products. We assess three atmospheric correction strategies, differing in their approaches to simulate instantaneous as well as pixel-wise abundances of diffuse and direct irradiance. We use physically-based approaches in combination with either digital elevation models (DEM), fine resolution digital object models (DOM), or 3D modelling output from the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. The such obtained top-of-canopy reflectances at the Laegern test-site in Switzerland, are used to assess retrieval improvement for a set of indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), as well as chlorophyll and carotenoid indices). We demonstrate that both, the DOM and the DART based approach, improve the retrievals for flat cast-shadows by <= 71% compared to using a DEM. In dense forest areas, improvements are less significant. Remaining key issues are related to overestimating surface reflectance under extreme illumination conditions.

AB  - Gunung Palung National Park (1,080 km(2), 1 degrees 3' - 1 degrees 22'S, 109 degrees 54' - 110 degrees 28'E) was first protected in 1937 and is now one of the largest remaining primary lowland mixed dipterocarp forests on Borneo. To help inform conservation efforts, we measured forest cover change in the protected area using 11 multi-temporal Landsat series images with path/row 121/61. Annual deforestation rates have declined since measurement began in 1989, to around 68 hectares per year in 2011 and 112 hectares per year in 2017. Halting deforestation in this protected area requires to tackle its underlying economic and social causes, and find ways for communities to meet their needs without resorting to forest clearing. Community empowerment, forest rehabilitation, and health care incentives as payment for ecosystem services can help reduce deforestation in Gunung Palung National Park. This becomes a positive trend which we must continue to always work in forest conservation. Future forest monitoring will be dependency with remote sensing analysis and open source remote sensing data such as Landsat and Sentinel data remain an important data source for historical forest change monitoring.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aeolian sedimentary processes and corresponding facies shape the Earth's surface and control the evolution of dune fields. The Namib Sand Sea with its Sossusvlei playa-lake is a perfect example to investigate the spatial distribution of fluvially influenced aeolian deposits. Remote sensing in combination with ground observations allowed for mapping of the facies distribution pattern of associated fluvial and aeolian sediments. Laboratory spectral signature measurements were used to further improve the separation between six groups of facies: modern aeolian sand, deflation surface, mud pool/mud drapes, heavy mineral lag, reworked fluvial-aeolian sediments, and fossil dune remnant. The best results were achieved through a supervised classification algorithm trained by field observations, a combination of Principal Component Analysis, band ratios, texture and geomorphologic indices. Consequently, a map outlining the facies distribution pattern of the Sossusvlei area at a scale of 1:10,000 was created. We propose this as a possible workflow to efficiently map and monitor desert environments and to investigate the interplay of aeolian and fluvial sediments.

TI  - Kuban farmers' attitudes toward Soviet agrarian transformations in the 1920s
T2  - RUDN JOURNAL OF RUSSIAN HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - How did the residents of Kuban region perceive the agrarian transformations that the Soviet authorities carried out in the post-revolutionary period? The archival sources studied in this paper reveal the attitude of the villagers to the land and tax policies of the Soviet state, their sentiments towards Soviet modernisation, as well as the relationship between Cossacks and non-residents during the land management campaign. While the history of the Kuban villages in the 1920s has attracted the interest of many researchers and regional historians, the sentiments and attitudes of the population towards the agrarian reforms by the Soviet authorities have so far received little attention. The measures of the Soviet state contributed not only to the eradication of the traditional Cossack culture but also radically altered the socio-economic and cultural profile of the Kuban villages, leading to the loss of Cossack identity. The article analyses the role of the Soviet authorities in the imposition of a socialist order. In the 1920s, their aim was the dissemination of pro-Soviet sentiments among the Kuban grain farmers. To this end, party and state authorities used various means and methods. Therefore, the study of the sentiments and attitude towards the Soviet authorities' actions has become an important channel for obtaining information. The Soviet organs attempted to investigate the attitudes of the farmers and took these data in account for adjusting their policies. The documents produced in this process have been a central source for the present article. In the 1920s the authorities launched a large-scale ideological project to make the Kuban population accept the Soviet worldview and embrace an archetypical Soviet mentality. In particular the poor and the non-urban population became pillars of social support for the new regime. The mechanisms that the Soviets applied for studying the sentiments of the Kuban grain farmers, together with other instruments of control and coercion, allowed the authorities to conduct a fairly successful Sovietisation campaign in the region, and to attract new proselytes to their side.

AB  - Characteristics of the wide-swath multi-spectral equipment with high-resolution (WSME-HR) installed at the Russian Resurs-P type satellites are represented. The possibility of applying the data obtained by this sensor for solving the satellite hydrophysics problems is considered. The chlorophyll a concentration and the normalized water-leaving radiance calculated by the Earth operational monitoring scientific center JSC Russian Space Systems are compared with the similar products of the foreign optical sensors MODIS (Aqua and Terra) and OLI (Landsat-8). Being analyzed, the normalized water-leaving radiance spectra show the values retrieved from the WSME-HR data to be about two times higher in the red spectral range and by 15-20 % smaller in the green spectral range than the analogous ones resulted from the foreign sensors; whereas in the blue spectral range they do not reproduce both their typical maximum on the 488 nm wavelength and their decrease accompanying the dissolved colored organic matter absorption at the 412 and 443 inn. The chlorophyll a concentration values derived from the data of all the sensors are comparable with each other. This fact is explained by minimum differences between the values of the normalized water-leaving radiance at the 488 and 555 nm applied for calculating the chlorophyll a concentration.

TI  - The problem of the relationship between faith and knowledge in Murtaza Mutahhari's philosophy
T2  - FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with the views of Murtaza Mutahhari (1902-1989), contemporary Iranian philosopher and a major ideologue and close associate of Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of 1978-1979 Iranian Revolution. The author traces the growth of the political doctrine of the so-called 'Rule or guardianship by a jurist' (vilayat-i faqih), as developed by Mutahhari, and shows that the latter argues for the dominant role of religion in Iranian society on the assumption that the very foundation of the teachings of Islam is reason. The central point of Mutahhari's theory is the problem of the relation of faith (iman) to knowledge (ilm), in approaching which he follows along the traditional lines of Islamic philosophy. According to Mutahhari, between faith and knowledge there is no strict dichotomy, and indeed they are related to one another as two complementary concepts representing, respectively, the explicit and the hidden sides of the same reality. Knowledge, from this point of view, can be understood as a necessary condition of religious faith (iman-i mazhabi) which, in its turn, should be interpreted as one of the basic elements of individual consciousness and the most important 'constitutive' principle in man, Iranian society and the Islamic state.

TI  - THE AUTHOR AND THE HERO OF THE POEM BY A. K. TOLSTOY "JOHN OF DAMASCUS"
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - A. K. Tolstoy is a poet of the realistic epoch who kept a romantic approach to reality. The poem "John of Damascus" holds a specific place in the poet's creative body of work representing the writer's worldview and his aesthetic position. The subjective and objective world of the writing is under investigation in terms of Bakhtin's theory and modern historical poetics. The article brings to light the specificity of speech organization of the text, narration functioning, dialogue and monologue. While studying the poem the author appeals to the hagiographic texts and funeral canticles by the Reverend that allow precising the ties between the image of John and his prototype. He also points out the meaning of the closing episode of the hagiography of the Holy Man for the poem's storyline, and the role of the romantic motif of the detachment in the depiction of the hero. The hero's dialectic image in the poem is defined as the one that traces back to the image of the Reverend John of Damascus and remains under the impact of the image of the author himself. An inner nature of the hero's image is seen as a juxtaposition of the idea of the superior Divine office, deriving from the historical prototype, and the author's romantic aspiration for absolute freedom in creative work. The violation of an aesthetic border of the hero's objectivization is achieved due to the subjectiveness of the writer. The lyric monologues and fragments of the improper and direct speech constituting the poem objectify the hero's image. Through the expressiveness of the latter the author's subjectiveness is traced. The author and the hero are thought as the images that possess subjectiveness and objectified at the same time in the world. The study of the nature of subjective and objective relations in the poem gives an access to the value-based level of its content. The poem "John of Damascus" presents parallel ways of searching for truth by two poets a theologian and an artist. The first one comes to the ideal of a humbled man, whilst the other one to the idea of the assertion of man's dignity in front of God. The value-based level of the poem's content going back to orthodox understanding of the historical prototype, the hero's and author's images, defines semantic wholeness of the poem.

TI  - A method of downscaling temperature maps based on analytical hillshading for use in species distribution modelling
T2  - CARTOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate maps have been widely used for the construction of species distribution models. These maps derive from interpolation of data collected by meteorological stations. The sparse distribution of stations generates maps with coarse spatial resolution that are unable to detect microclimates or areas that can serve as plant or animal refuges. This work proposes a method for downscaling temperature maps using the solar radiation falling upon hillsides as predictor for the influence of relief on local variability. Solar irradiance is estimated from a digital elevation model of the study area using a routine based on analytical hillshading. Some examples of downscaling from 1km to 25m spatial resolution are shown. The results are compared with the surface temperature maps from Landsat 8 satellite imagery.

TI  - A multiple dataset approach for 30-m resolution land cover mapping: a case study of continental Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments in global land-cover mapping have focused on spatial resolution improvement with more heterogeneous features to integrate spatial, spectral and temporal information. In this study, hundreds of features derived from four seasonal Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) spectral bands, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series vegetation index (VI) data, night-time light (NTL), digital elevation models (DEM) and climatic variables were used for land cover mapping with a target 30-m resolution for the whole African continent. In total, 49,007 training samples (from 11,231 locations) and 23,803 validation samples (from 5,414 locations) interpreted from seasonal Landsat, MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and high-resolution images in Google Earth were used for classifier training (Random Forest) and map validation. Overall accuracy was 76% at 30-m spatial resolution, which is better than previous land cover mapping for the African continent. Besides, accuracies for cropland were improved dramatically by more than 10%. Our method also addressed many remaining issues for 30-m mapping (e.g. boundary effects and declines in resolution). This framework is promising for automatic and efficient global land cover mapping resulting in better visual effects and classification accuracy.

TI  - Merging Satellite Retrievals and Reanalyses to Produce Global Long-Term and Consistent Surface Incident Solar Radiation Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface incident solar radiation (R-s) is a key parameter in many climatic and ecological processes. The data from satellites and reanalysis have been widely used. However, for reanalysis, R-s data has been shown to have substantial spatial bias, and the time span of reliable satellite R-s is too short for climatic and ecological studies. Combining reanalysis and satellite data would be an effective method for generating long-term and consistent R-s datasets. Here, we apply a cumulative probability density function-based (CPDF) method to merge eight reanalyses with the latest available satellite R-s data from Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System Energy Balanced and Filled (CERES EBAF) surface retrievals. The CPDF method not only reduces the spatial bias of the reanalysis R-s data, but also makes the R-s datasets in a global, long-term and consistent way. The observed R-s data collected at 54 Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations from 1992 to 2016 are used to evaluate the method. Results show that the CPDF method could reduce the mean absolute biases (MAB) of the reanalysis R-s effectively by 21.24-64.36%. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis interim (ERA-interim) reanalysis R-s data, which are available for 1979 onward, perform the best before MAB = 13.20 Wm(-2) and after MAB = 10.40 Wm(-2) merging. This small post-merging MAB of the ERA-interim reanalysis is caused by the MAB of 9.90 Wm(-2) in the satellite R-s retrievals. The Japanese 55-year reanalysis provides R-s values back to 1958, and CPDF can reduce its MAB by 32.87%, to 11.17 Wm(-2). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-CIRES twentieth-century reanalysis (CIRES) and the ECMWF twentieth-century reanalysis (ERA20CM) provide century-long R-s estimates. CIRES performs better after merging. The MAB of CIRES can be reduced by 32.10%, to 12.99 Wm(,)(-2) while ERA20CM's can be reduced by 12.51%, to 16.40 Wm(-2).

TI  - Monitoring and evaluation in freeze stress of winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) through canopy hyperspectrum reflectance and multiple statistical analysis
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to evaluate the freeze stress of the winter wheat, field and pot experiments were conducted. The crop variables including plant height, above ground dry biomass (AGDB), chlorophyll content (CHLC), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), photosynthetic indexes, and canopy spectra were selected and assessed. Statistical methods of correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), importance of variables analysis, and multiple linear regression (MLR) were implemented to establish freeze injury comprehensive evaluation index (FICEI), extract sensitive bands, and build the freeze injury predictive model. The results demonstrated that FICEI can be used to evaluate the damage degree. The major spectral regions were selected with the B-coefficient, variable importance in projection (VIP), and the frequencies of selection (FS) parameters derived from the PLS analysis. The combination of all three approaches can be utilized to reduce invalid spectral regions. According to the importance of variables analysis, the seven sensitive bands were extracted, which were 574 nm, 702 nm, 1093 nm, 1111 nm, 1210 nm, 1302 nm, and 1333 nm, respectively. The calibrated MLR model based on the selected bands demonstrated an excellent performance as the R-2 and RMSE were 0.924, 0.279 for FICEI. The model also illustrated an accurate and robust performance by using the pot validation data set since the higher value of coefficient of the determination and lower root mean squared error in validation model were confirmed. Our findings show that the estimation model for FICEI of winter wheat is reliable.

TI  - Urban Zoning Using Higher-Order Markov Random Fields on Multi-View Imagery Data
T2  - COMPUTER VISION - ECCV 2018, PT VIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)
CL  - Munich, GERMANY
AB  - Urban zoning enables various applications in land use analysis and urban planning. As cities evolve, it is important to constantly update the zoning maps of cities to reflect urban pattern changes. This paper proposes a method for automatic urban zoning using higher-order Markov random fields (HO-MRF) built on multi-view imagery data including street-view photos and top-view satellite images. In the proposed HO-MRF, top-view satellite data is segmented via a multi-scale deep convolutional neural network (MS-CNN) and used in lower-order potentials. Street-view data with geo-tagged information is augmented in higher-order potentials. Various feature types for classifying street-view images were also investigated in our work. We evaluated the proposed method on a number of famous metropolises and provided in-depth analysis on technical issues.

AB  - Forest coverage rate is an indicator that reflects the possession of forest area or the abundance of forest resources and the degree of greening in a country or region and is also an important basis for determining the policy of forest management and development and utilization. For example, the extraction of the forest coverage rate is the basic data for the back volume and biomass inversion. Based on this, this paper takes Shangri-La of Yunnan Province as the research area, adopts the fusion of multispectral and panchromatic images, and extracts the forest coverage rate based on the classification technology. The data source includes Landsat 8 data, ZY3-01, GLAS 14, DEM and other auxiliary data, to extract features such as spectrum, NDVI etc., utilizing high-precision GLAS 14 data and SVR regression method to correct the ground objects height obtained by ZY3-01, incorporating this spatial feature into spectral features and then using Classification And Regression Trees(CART) method to classify them. Yearbook statistics are evaluated and verified. The results showed that the forest coverage rate of Shangri-La forest land extracted by the CART method was 74.22%. The forest resource planning and design investigation report in Shangri-La County, Yunnan Province is 74.99%, which shows that the CART decision tree method in this study area is applicable to the extraction of forest coverage rate, and it also proves that the classification methods of remote sensing data is efficient for the ecological indicator inversion.

TI  - A novel change detection approach based on visual saliency and random forest from multi-temporal high-resolution remote-sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a novel change detection (CD) approach for high-resolution remote-sensing images, which incorporates visual saliency and random forest (RF). First, highly homogeneous and compact image super-pixels are generated using super-pixel segmentation, and the optimal segmentation result is obtained through image superimposition and principal component analysis. Second, saliency detection is used to guide the search of interest regions in the initial difference image obtained via the improved robust change vector analysis algorithm. The salient regions within the difference image that correspond to the binarized saliency map are extracted, and the regions are subject to the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering to obtain the pixel-level pre-classification result, which can be used as a prerequisite for super-pixel-based analysis. Third, on the basis of the optimal segmentation and pixel-level pre-classification results, different super-pixel change possibilities are calculated. Furthermore, the changed and unchanged super-pixels that serve as the training samples are automatically selected. The spectral features and Gabor features of each super-pixel are extracted. Finally, super-pixel-based CD is implemented by applying RF based on these samples. Experimental results on Quickbird, Ziyuan 3 (ZY3), and Gaofen 2 (GF2) multi-spectral images show that the proposed method outperforms the compared methods in the accuracy of CD, and also confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Correlation between the intrinsic subtype and diagnostic methods of axillary lymph node metastasis in primary breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To discover the relationship between intrinsic subtypes and axillary lymph nodes metastatic proportion, to compare the accuracy of clinical examination, ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology of suspicious axillary nodes, and to evaluate the best method of axillary lymph nodes staging in patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: From May 2010 to March 2015, patients presenting with primary breast cancer had clinical examination and ultrasonography for axillary lymph node staging. The pathological results of US-guided needle biopsy and clinical data of these patients were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Results: A total of 292 (41.8%) of 698 patients confirmed the presence of axillary lymph nodes metastases. Luminal B (HER2-) and HER2 positive tumors had a higher node positivity rate than other intrinsic types. Axillary lymph nodes metastases rate indicates significant difference in each intrinsic subtype. Sixty-eight (11.5%) node-positive patients were identified by ultrasound-fine needle aspiration cytology (BUS-FNAC) and spared unnecessary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Fifteen (14.2%) patients who had palpable lymph nodes had negative results in both FNAC and SLNB, and spared unnecessary complete axillary node clearance. Clinical examination had an accuracy of 69.1%, and EBUS-FNAC had 79.4%. Conclusion: The intrinsic subtypes are related with axillary lymph node metastasis in primary breast cancer. In comparing with clinical examination, ultrasonography evaluation for axilla status, combined with ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of suspicious axillary node is more accurate, and it is valuable prior to SLNB in primary breast cancer treatment.

AB  - Use of machine learning to develop algorithms for distinguishing iceberg and vessel targets requires large validated data sets that are often costly, time consuming and, in some cases, inaccessible. Generating electromagnetic (EM) backscatter models of iceberg and ship targets can be a vital step in developing a robust iceberg/ship classification algorithm. In this work, EM backscatter models for icebergs are developed using an EM backscatter modelling tool called GRECOSAR and compared with ground truth data. The imaging scene consists of iceberg targets surrounded by the ocean surface. The 3D computer aided design models of the icebergs were obtained using LiDAR and multi-beam sonar data collected during a field program off the coast of Salvage, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. While profiling the iceberg targets, a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image from Sentinel-1A was captured and compared with the simulated SAR images. Comparisons made in terms of total radar cross section (TRCS) and the SAR signature of the targets generally indicate credible simulations. Simulated SAR images were generated at low and high dielectric conditions to mimic cold and melt iceberg surfaces. Variability of the TRCS and morphology as a function of target orientation highlights the usefulness of EM modelling in developing robust iceberg/ship classifiers.

AB  - Objective: to identify drug interactions resulting from scheduling and errors in the preparation of antibacterials. Methods: observational and cross-sectional study carried out in medical clinics of a sentinel hospital. Data were collected through the observation of prescriptions and the preparation of 265 doses of antibacterials with the use of a check list. Results: the administration of Piperaciclina and Tazobactan prevailed, with 51 doses. The scheduling of antibacterials with another drug occurred predominantly in the morning. Interactions with injectable anticoagulants and between antimicrobials of different classes stood out. The scheduling was associated with the lack of availability of printed guidelines on medication administration (p=0.003). The main error was the dose (32.5%). Conclusion: the scheduling of antibacterials in the medical clinic may potentiate possible drug interactions and dose errors have been identified in the administration of drugs.

AB  - Prescribed burning is a technique applied to control fire risk, and it has been used in the forests of Western Australia since the 1960s. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are sensitive to vegetation structural changes and may detect changes in understory vegetation particularly when the upper forest canopy remains largely unaffected, as it is often the case for prescribed burns. In this study, the ability of the Radar Burn Ratio (RBR), a SAR index that measures the degree of change between pre- and post-event radar backscatter, to appraise fire efficiency in prescribed burns was assessed. Data acquired by the L-band PALSAR-2 sensor, onboard the ALOS-2 satellite, were analysed to study the relationship between radar backscatter coefficient and prescribed burns carried out in eucalypt forests in Western Australia. A previously proposed framework was adapted to evaluate burn impacts in different environmental conditions (dry, wet and mean) using HV and HH polarizations as well as the RFDI (Radar Forest Degradation Index). A linear relationship between RBR and fire severity was found for HV polarization and RFDI confirming previous results observed for wildfires. RBRHV in dry environmental conditions yielded the most accurate estimates of fire impact (OA = 77.8 %; k = 0.67). RBRHH showed higher ability to differentiate between severity classes in wet conditions while the RBRRFDI showed an intermediate behavior. HH polarization and RFDI showed special ability for burn area detection in wet conditions. The results showed that it is possible to estimate the impact of prescribed burns using SAR data. As such, SAR data could contribute and assess the effectiveness of fire policy in Western Australia and similar environments.

AB  - Remote sensing-derived maps contain errors. The magnitude of such errors is evaluated through accuracy assessment based on sub-sampling the total 'population' (i.e. map). Several strategies have been proposed to define the optimal sampling design leading to a statistically robust accuracy assessment. In this work, a stratified random sampling approach as proposed by Padilla et al.(1) was applied to validate two burned area (BA) products as part of the ESA's Fire-cci project: a SAR-based product generated from S1 data and the MODIS MCD64. The sampling design considers sample allocation as a function of burned area proportion inside each biome. In our study the sampling size was computed as suggested by Olofsson et al.(2). The objective of this study was to assess to which extent a reduction in the sampling size influences the accuracy metrics. The validation was carried out for BA detected from Sentinel-1 as well as a MODIS based-product, the MCD64, generated for the year 2017 in the Amazon region (8M km(2)). The reference BA dataset was generated using optical time-series acquired by the Landsat-7 ETM+, Landsat-8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 MSI sensors. The BA products were validated three times: i) over n = 44 sample units (as computed from Olofsson et al.(2); ii) considering a sample size of n/2, and iii) considering a sample size of n/4, to test the sensitivity of the accuracy assessment to changes in the sample size over the tropics.The results showed that halving the sample size while maintaining the stratified allocation method, yielded similar results when compared to the original sample size (differences in OE and CE did not exceed 5% in any of the products, while differences in DC did not exceed 2%). For a sample size of n/4, the validation results were more unstable (differences in DC reached up to 9% and confidence intervals were higher). The results provide evidence for the optimal sampling size for the accuracy assessment of different BA products over the Amazon basin.

TI  - High resolution forest inventory of pure and mixed stands at regional level combining National Forest Inventory field plots, Landsat, and low density lidar
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many countries have employed recently developed technologies, such as airborne lidar, to capture nationwide three-dimensional information over the past few years. In Spain, a huge volume of lidar information is available for the majority of the territory in the Spanish National Plan of Aerial Orthophotography. In this article, a multi-source approach is taken, integrating available databases, such as nationwide lidar flights, Landsat imagery and permanent field plots from the Spanish National Forest Inventory, with good results in the generation of wall-to-wall forest inventories. Volume and basal area errors are similar to those obtained by other authors (using specific lidar flights and field plots) for similar species. Errors in stem number estimates are larger than the values found in the literature as a consequence of the great influence of variable-radius plots, as used in the Spanish National Forest Inventory, on this variable.

TI  - Sentinel Node Biopsy in Melanoma: A Short Update
T2  - DERMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Several controversies are still ongoing about sentinel node biopsy in melanoma. It is basically a staging procedure for melanoma >0.75 mm in thickness or for thinner melanoma in the presence of ulceration, high mitotic rate, and/or lymphovascular invasion. Complete lymph node dissection after a positive sentinel node can also allow a better locoregional disease control but seems not to prevent the development of distant metastases. The use of sentinel node biopsy in atypical Spitz tumors should be discouraged because of their peculiar biological properties. (C) 2018 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Nowadays, research practice in all scientific disciplines is increasingly, and in many cases exclusively, data driven. Knowledge of how to use tools to manipulate research data, and the availability of e-Infrastructures to support them for data storage, processing, analysis and preservation, is fundamental. In parallel, new types of communities are forming around interests in digital tools, computing facilities and data repositories. By making infrastructure services, community engagement and training inseparable, existing communities can be empowered by new ways of doing research, and new communities can be created around tools and data. Europe is ideally positioned to become a world leader as provider of research data for the benefit of research communities and the wider economy and society. Europe would benefit from an integrated infrastructure where data and computing services for big data can be easily shared and reused. This is particularly challenging in EO given the volumes and variety of the data that make scalable access difficult, if not impossible, to individual researchers and small groups (i.e. to the so-called long tail of science). To overcome this limitation, as part of the European Commission Digital Single Market strategy, the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) initiative was launched in April 2016, with the final aim to realise the European Research Area (ERA) and raise research to the next level. It promotes not only scientific excellence and data reuse, but also job growth and increased competitiveness in Europe, and results in Europe-wide cost efficiencies in scientific infrastructure through the promotion of interoperability on an unprecedented scale. This chapter analyses existing barriers to achieve this aim and proposes the Open Science Commons as the fundamental principles to create an EOSC able to offer an integrated infrastructure for the depositing, sharing and reuse of big data, including Earth Observation (EO) data, leveraging and enhancing the current e-Infrastructure landscape, through standardization, interoperability, policy and governance. Finally, it is shown how an EOSC built on e-Infrastructures can improve the discovery, retrieval and processing capabilities of EO data, offering virtualised access to geographically distributed data and the computing necessary to manipulate and manage large volumes. Well-established e-Infrastructure services could provide a set of reusable components to accelerate the development of exploitation platforms for satellite data solving common problems, such as user authentication and authorisation, monitoring or accounting.

TI  - Long-interval monitoring reveals changes in the structure of a reptile community in a biogeographic transition zone
T2  - Basic and Applied Herpetology
M3  - Article
AB  - Transition zones between biogeographical regions are natural scenarios to examine responses to local disturbances between species with contrasting biogeographic affinities. We compared absolute abundances of reptile species between fieldwork surveys carried out in 1999-2001 and 2012-2014 along a 1.5 km linear transect at the Peneda-Geres National Park (NW Portugal), an area located in the transition zone between Mediterranean and Atlantic biogeographical regions. During the 13-year period, wildfires in 2007 and 2009 burnt two adjacent areas located on the southern part of the study area. Based on Landsat imagery, land cover analysis demonstrated significant differences between both periods, with an increase of open areas caused by the wildfires. We performed 99 surveys and detected 1774 reptiles belonging to five lizard and six snake species. There were changes in the reptile assemblage: Lacerta schreiberi (Atlantic lizard) showed a decrease in relative abundance from the first period, Podarcis sp (wall lizards) showed an increase, and Psam-modromus algirus (Mediterranean lizard) colonized the study site in the second period. This field-based monitoring study confirms niche modelling predictions that forecasted range contraction for some Atlantic reptiles and expansion for some Mediterranean reptiles. Our results emphasize the importance of long-term monitoring to understand the magnitude of disturbance impacts on (reptile) communities.

T2  - DOCUMENTS D ANALISI GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the spatial distribution of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and its relationship with diverse urban land covers and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The study area was Monte Hermoso city, which is located in the southwest of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. To obtain the LST and NDVI parameters, satellite images from LANDSAT 5 TM and LANDSAT 7 ETM+ sensors were seasonally processed for the period 2008-2012. Visual interpretation techniques and empirical intervention were applied to design an urban land cover map on which LST and NDVI were analyzed by tracing four transects oriented in latitudinal and longitudinal directions. Each urban cover presented a particular behavior of these parameters. Furthermore, significant results for the relationship between LST and NDVI were observed (with alpha 0.1 and 0.05) with R-2, Pearson, and Spearman indices values higher than 0.7. Finally, LST variation in diverse land covers was observed as a consequence of urban growth and the alteration of the vegetation coverage. Therefore, it was concluded that the spatial and temporal variation of LST values may indicate modifications in urban land covers. The information obtained in this study would be a useful tool to guide future urban management studies and policies.

AB  - In this study, multi-polarimetric features extracted from dual-polarimetric (DP) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data collected by the Sentinel-1 SAR mission are exploited to analyze damages due to earthquakes. First, conventional single-polarization features, based on the coherence between pre-and post-event imagery, are analyzed using both the co-polarized and the cross-polarized channels to point out that the information carried on the two channels is different. Then, a coherent dual-polarimetric feature, based on the inter-channel coherence, is proposed. Results show that the latter feature allows to detect the changes after an earthquake using only two SAR acquisitions, i.e.; before and after the earthquake. Finally, a change detection algorithm based on the eigenvalues of the difference of covariance matrices, is proposed. Experimental results show that the DP information allows to improve the results obtained by conventional single polarization change detection techniques.

M3  - Article
AB  - Consider a nonparametric nonseparable regression model Y = phi(Z, U), where phi(Z, U) is strictly increasing in U and U approximate to U[0, 1]. We suppose that there exists an instrument W that is independent of U. The observable random variables are Y, Z, and W, all one-dimensional. We construct test statistics for the hypothesis that Z is exogenous, that is, that U is independent of Z. The test statistics are based on the observation that Z is exogenous if and only if V = F-Y|Z(Y|Z) is independent of W, and hence they do not require the estimation of the function phi. The asymptotic properties of the proposed tests are proved, and a bootstrap approximation of the critical values of the tests is shown to be consistent and to work for finite samples via simulations. An empirical example using the U.K. Family Expenditure Survey is also given. As a byproduct of our results we obtain the asymptotic properties of a kernel estimator of the distribution of V, which equals U when Z is exogenous. We show that this estimator converges to the uniform distribution at faster rate than the parametric n(- 1/2)-rate.

With minor improvements to the data processing method previously applied to Florida survey data (2003, 2006, 2012-2017), we estimate the diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 532 nm, K-d (532), to be 0.045-0.060 m(-1) in both regions. The results are in good agreement with space satellite data for the days of the lidar surveys and with Jerlov's K-d curves for water classes I and IB.

AB  - Is it possible to develop sustainable tourism infrastructures in karst regions where the hydro-geological system is highly perturbed due to the over-exploitation of the water resources? The new resorts area located north-east of the Dead Sea coast in Jordan, is the test-bed used to answer this question. The analysis of Sentinel optical and SAR images, in-situ observations and geological data, has been carried out to produce displacement, vulnerability and thematic maps at cadastral parcel scale. This research demonstrates that without costly remediation work the sustainability is doubtful: the Dead Sea hydro-geological system is more and more unbalanced; an increasing number of hotels and resorts are affected by sinkholes, landslides and subsidence with significant damage to the buildings and the infrastructure. Remote sensing techniques complemented by in-situ and geological data can provide most of the actionable knowledge needed for efficient remediation solutions and for the development of an early warning system.

T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Technical paper presented at the 2018 Defence and Security Doctoral Symposium.Trust is often explored as a determinant of appropriate automation usage and reliance. Despite the wealth of research into the antecedents, decision making and cognitive factors to facilitate human-automation interaction, internal factors that influence dispositional trust, are often underrepresented. High speciality and criticality domains characterise the most researched areas in this field, however, there are minimal studies exploring organisational culture, such as within the military, and their effect on trust in automation. The research seeks to explore the dominant narratives of differing echelons of the military (ground, air, surface and subsurface) through responsive interviewing and examining the unique culture borne of strong hierarchical order, regulations and training in parallel to civilians. Furthermore, within the larger scope, submarine culture is psychosocially distinctive due to the environmental constraints of active duty, such as the isolation and restrictions incurred by lengthy operational deployment. Due to this seclusion, submarine life is often distinct from other strata owing to the weight of human-human trust and kinship placed on the personnel over automated teammates (e.g., decision making software). The research plans to delve into the experiences of this idiosyncratic workforce and others to explore how service potentially alters their views and experience of human-automation/system interactions and whether underlying skepticisms, expertise or training play a part in their worldview.

CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Mid-infrared (mid-IR or 3.5 - 5.0 mu m) laser sources are widely employed in applications such as laser projectors, remote sensing of the atmosphere and countermeasures against heat seeking missiles. In this paper, we describe the development of a mid-IR laser source which can be used as a ground-based system for remote sensing applications and testing countermeasure effectiveness in the field.For this purpose, we developed an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) based on a ZnGeP2 (ZGP) crystal for converting a 2.1-mu m pump laser into mid-IR. The pump laser is an acousto-optically Q-switched Ho: YAG laser pumped by a continuous-wave (cw) Tm:fiber laser. The maximum possible average mid-IR power obtained is 6.5 W at a pump power of 20 W with a 33% power conversion efficiency. The pump pulses resulting from the Q-switched operation of the Ho: YAG laser have a pulse width of 30 ns (FWHM) at a pulse repetition rate (PRR) of 50 kHz.Between the pump laser and the OPO, we use a Faraday isolator for protecting the pump laser from back reflections of the output beam coupling into the pump laser cavity, we also use a polarization rotator and a lens which focuses the pump beam down to a spot of 275 mu m (1/e(2), diameter) at the center of the 15-mm long and 55 degrees-cut ZGP crystal located in the middle of a 19-mm long cavity formed by two flat mirrors. The OPO cavity is doubly resonant, the input mirror is a high transmitter at 2.1 mu m and a high reflector in mid-IR whereas the output mirror is a high transmitter at 2.1 mu m but a partial reflector with a reflectance of 50% in mid-IR. The mid-IR and residual pump beams are separated from each other using a dichroic mirror. We characterized the performance of the OPO in terms of the mid-IR power, power conversion efficiency and pump depletion as functions of the input pump power. We recorded the wavelength spectrum of the mid-IR beam.

The essay will focus on two texts: Metade cara metade mascara by Eliane Potiguara and Todas as coisas sao pequenas by Daniel Munduruku. Whereas Potiguara's book is a hybrid composition that mixes mythical discourse, poetry and personal testimony, Munduruku's text is closer to the model of the baroque novel as described by Bakhtin. Through the analysis of these two books, the article demonstrates that Amerindian authors are initiating a new literary tradition in Brazil.

TI  - On the use of temporal vegetation indices in support of eligibility controls for EU aids in agriculture
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has progressively become an official method to support European (EU) Member States in carrying out controls about declarations of farmers requiring EU subsidies in agriculture.Reliable automatic or semi-automatic methodologies aiming at crop identification are still being developed and the only technique, which is officially accepted in the CAP context, remains photo interpretation of high/very high (satellite or aerial) orthoimages. To verify past situations, only orthophotos can be used but, unfortunately, they are not always available. In these cases, the use of satellite sensors with adequate spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, together with a reliable data analysis technique, could support or even substitute orthophoto interpretation.In this study, we propose a multi-temporal, multispectral algorithm exploiting the Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus data on Landsat platforms to identify different land covers in the context of CAP. Here it is presented to discriminate arable from non-arable lands. Assessment of the methodology was carried out using Corine 2012 and more than 1500 validation points over Basilicata region (Southern Italy). A general good agreement was found (74%), which increases to 82% in the specific case of arable land identification.

TI  - The determinants of crown fire runs during extreme wildfires in broadleaf forests in Australia
T2  - ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH 2018
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th International Conference on Forest Fire Research
CL  - Coimbra, PORTUGAL
AB  - Crown fires in forest ecosystems can pose a major threat to life and property due to their high intensities and rapid rates of spread. However, research into the prediction of crown fire dynamics in the Eucalyptus forests of Australia is limited. Previous studies have focused on coarse temporal scales, utilised low resolution weather based predictors, and disregard the spatial nature of crown fires. Our study aimed to use observations from large wildfires in eucalypt forests to develop an empirical model to predict the likelihood of crown fire events using environmental predictors at an hourly scale. Our study was conducted in south-eastern Australia using data from fifteen large wildfires that occurred between 2009 and 2015. Fire severity maps were created for each fire at a 30 m resolution using Landsat imagery from which we calculated the proportion of 30 m pixels experiencing crown fire within a 150 x 150 m window (2.25 ha). Predictor variables were chosen to represent the four key environmental drivers of fire behaviour, namely fuel moisture (i.e. live and dead fuel), fuel load and structure (i.e. surface, elevated and bark fuels, tree height), fire weather (i.e. vapour-pressure deficit, wind speed, relative wind direction) and topography (i.e. slope and ruggedness). Random Forests were used to model the effect of environmental drivers on the proportion of crown fire. Fuel moisture content variables were the best predictors of probability of crown consumption. Topographic variables and fire weather had only an intermediate influence and fuel load and structure had the lowest influence. Crown fire runs largely occurred when thresholds in vapour-pressure deficit (<4 kPa) and dead fuel moisture content (<7%) were exceeded. Predictions from the model showed a high degree of agreement with the raw fire severity maps. The proposed models have the potential to provide guidance on the likelihood of crown fire during fire events.

TI  - TM/ETM plus /LDCM Images for Studying Land Surface Temperature (LST) Interplay with Impervious Surfaces Changes over Time Within the Douala Metropolis, Cameroon
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Douala, the most important metropolis of Cameroon, is a sub-Saharan wet coastal environment of which the anarchic urbanization is a socio-economic and environmental problem, significantly influencing the local climate. In this study, three Landsat images from 1986 (TM), 2007 (ETM+) and 2016 (LDCM), were utilized to investigate the effect of this urbanization on the increasing land surface temperature (LST) between these dates. Thus, the urban indices (UI), determined from the Landsat Visible and NIR channels were used to identify impervious areas (Urban Fabric and bare soil) of urban area. It has been shown from the UI images that, impervious areas have been increased from 1986 to 2016. The LST images derived have a continual expansion of zones and points of heat throughout these dates. The correlation analysis of LST and UI, at the pixel-scale, indicated the positive relationship between these parameters, which could show a real impact of urbanization on the increasing temperature in the area. These correlations are fairly low in 1986 (maximum R-square value is about 0.35) and in 2007 (maximum R-square value is about 0.44. In 2016, a high positive correlation (maximum R-square value is about 0.77) confirm that, the impervious areas strengthen the temperature and the Urban Heat Island effect in Douala urban zone. Overall, the earth observation images and the geographic information system techniques were effective approaches for aiming at environment monitoring and analyzing urban growth patterns and evaluating their impacts on urban climates.

TI  - A Review of Oil Spill Remote Sensing
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - The technical aspects of oil spill remote sensing are examined and the practical uses and drawbacks of each technology are given with a focus on unfolding technology. The use of visible techniques is ubiquitous, but limited to certain observational conditions and simple applications. Infrared cameras offer some potential as oil spill sensors but have several limitations. Both techniques, although limited in capability, are widely used because of their increasing economy. The laser fluorosensor uniquely detects oil on substrates that include shoreline, water, soil, plants, ice, and snow. New commercial units have come out in the last few years. Radar detects calm areas on water and thus oil on water, because oil will reduce capillary waves on a water surface given moderate winds. Radar provides a unique option for wide area surveillance, all day or night and rainy/cloudy weather. Satellite-carried radars with their frequent overpass and high spatial resolution make these day-night and all-weather sensors essential for delineating both large spills and monitoring ship and platform oil discharges. Most strategic oil spill mapping is now being carried out using radar. Slick thickness measurements have been sought for many years. The operative technique at this time is the passive microwave. New techniques for calibration and verification have made these instruments more reliable.

AB  - Estimating parameters for global climate models via combined active and passive microwave remote sensing data has been a subject of intensive research in recent years. A variety of retrieval algorithms has been proposed for the estimation of soil moisture, vegetation optical depth and other parameters. A novel attenuation-based retrieval approach is proposed here to globally estimate the gravimetric moisture of vegetation (m(g)) and retrieve information about the amount of water [kg] per amount of wet vegetation [kg]. The parameter m(g) is particularly interesting for agro-ecosystems, to assess the status of growing vegetation. The key feature of the proposed approach is that it relies on multi-sensor data from three sensor types (microwave radar, microwave radiometer, and lidar) to solve the physics equations and obtain m(g)-estimates. The comparability of these estimates to literature values as well as to results of a globally applied, retrieval approach of Grant [4], reveal the potential of the developed method.

AB  - Traditional human representation is unable to conserve complete information. Therefore ignorance, uncertainty, ambiguity to mankind's best conceivable worldview are even more amplified. To minimize this problem, we need to develop a reliable and effective ontological uncertainty management (OUM) approach. To reach this goal requires starting from traditional mankind worldview to arrive at a convenient OUM framework. Learning from neuroscience helps to develop neuromorphic systems able to overcome previous representation limitations by appropriate OUM solution. Furthermore, according to CICT (computational information conservation theory), the information content of any symbolic representation emerges from the capturing of two fundamental coupled components, i.e. the linear one (unfolded) and the nonlinear one (folded), interacting with their environment. Thanks to its intrinsic self-scaling properties, this system approach can be applied at any system scale, from single quantum system application to full system governance strategic assessment policies and beyond. A detailed OUM application example, taking advantage of the well-known EPM (elementary pragmatic model) by De Giacomo & Silvestri, to achieve full information extraction and conservation, is presented. This chapter is a relevant contribution to effective OUM solution development framework for learning and creativity, emerging from a Post-Bertalanffy General Theory of Systems.

AB  - Groundwater has a very important role both in terms of environmental, social and economic. The consumption of groundwater continuously can affect the physical condition of the environment such as land subsidence, especially in Semarang City. The spatial correlation of land subsidence and water table changes was analyzed in this study using remote sensing and geographic information systems. PS-InSAR method is used to process Sentinel-1 SAR image satellite to get the result of land subsidence during in 2014-2017. The annual average of vertical land subsidence in Semarang City, with the range 0 +/- 3.4 cm to 4.5 +/- 3.4. The spatial relation between the land subsidence and the water table decreased is obtained using the rules of the spatial correlation matrix. The study area was dominated by a very high correlation with the percentage (47.58%), which located in several areas in Genuk District, Tembalang District, Pedurungan District, Tugu District and Mijen District. The potential of groundwater in unconfined aquifers in Semarang City is nihil potential and low potential of groundwater quality. The very high correlation between land subsidence and water table decreased, which located in the low potential of groundwater in unconfined aquifer mostly located in Tembalang District.

In addition to FY, JK, and MNS genotyping, the RH blood group system is now explored in SCD patients in France. Molecular typing has been used for the deduction of partial RH2 (C) antigens since 2010, and the gradual implementation of systematic RHD and RHCE genotyping nationwide was initiated in late 2014. In our laboratory, 962 RH: 2 (C-positive) SCD patients have been tested since 2010, and 1,148 SCD patients of all RH phenotypes have been genotyped for clinically relevant alleles of RHD and RHCE since late 2014.

AB  - Evapotranspiration is the hydrological variable of greatest relevance in the Argentina Pampas Region (APR). The estimation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) in this area becomes essential since primary productivity is directly linked to water availability. In order to evaluate the MOD16_A2 product of evapotranspiration (ET), a comparison with in situ measurements was conducted. We used ET data provided by the Oficina de Riesgo Agropecuario, corresponding to 24 stations placed in the region covering all seasons for the years 2012 to 2014. Results show an overestimation of 86% and 52% in Autumn-Winter and Spring-Summer, respectively. Mean Absolut Error (MAE) range between +/- 0.9 and +/- 2.1 mm day(-1) in Autumn-Winter, and between +/- 1.6 and +/- 2.6 mm day(-1) in Spring-Summer, with R-2 values close to 0.7 for both data sets, with no seasonal differences at this point. Overestimation in PET was found to be partly due to the empirical model used in the MOD16_A2 product to determine the downward longwave radiation (Rl(down arrow)) term. A specific application in our study sites showed that the term of Rl(down arrow) produces in an overestimation of 1 mm day(-1) in the calculation of PET. Although further research is still required to find out the reasons for these discrepancies, these results advice to be cautious when using PET data of the MOD16_ A2 product in the APR.

AB  - Factors that negatively impact the environment invariably affect human health. Therefore, timely detection and monitoring of environmental contaminants are required. The study of biological samples obtained from sentinel species provides valuable information about the presence, accumulation and effects of toxic substances. This work recorded the concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OP) determined in blubber of five organisms of the species T. manatus manatus stranded in different regions of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Tabasco, Campeche and Quintana Roo) and in 15 specimens of the species T. truncatus that inhabited and were stranded in the Area of Protection of Flora and Fauna Lagoon of Terms in the State of Campeche. The range of concentrations found in manatees for total DDT (Sigma DDT) was 0.09-1.013 mg/kg on lipid base, mainly composed of p, p'-DDE, o, p'-DDT and p, p'-DDT, while for the bottlenose dolphins was 0.334-10.757 mg/kg. The highest values of Sigma DDT in manatees corresponded to a specimen from Quintana Roo. In bottlenose dolphins, the highest level was more than ten times higher than the maximum value registered in manatees. Although the sample size is small, the results suggest that the ban on the use of these compounds has had a positive impact on their levels in the sampled area, since the concentrations of OP reported in organisms from other latitudes are higher. However, it is necessary to carry out more studies, both in living organisms, as well as in those that are stranded and die in this area, in order to have greater certainty of the current concentrations of OP in these populations.

T2  - 2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Aerospace Conference
CL  - Big Sky, MT
AB  - This paper proposes the use of the disturbance observer for the design of an impedance controller to perform a safe capture of a target satellite by a space robot. First, the observer aids in the determination of the contact force between the servicer and the target. Later, once the almost perfect match between the actual and estimated contact force is demonstrated, the estimated force is used as input for an impedance controller with trajectory tracking. The advantages of estimating the contact force instead of measuring it are also discussed in the document. The design of the impedance control is performed such that the capturing process is compliant and safe, and thus it can help to advance towards an autonomous capture of space objects. A simulation experiment was set up to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the contact force is bounded and behaves smoothly in a spring-mass-damper-like manner, imposing an stable contact between the robot's end-effector and the servicer's capturing spot.

TI  - Discrimination of 3 dominant mangrove species from the Pacific coast of Mexico by spectroscopy on intact leaves
T2  - CIENCIAS MARINAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral discrimination of mangrove leaves is the first step in classifying remotely sensed imagery of mangrove forests. The objective of this study was to analyze spectroscopic data on leaves from the upper and lower parts of mangrove canopies to discriminate species and physiognomic types. Leaf samples from the upper and lower parts of the canopies of 3 mangrove species (Avicennia germinans, Laguncularia racemosa, and Rhizophora mangle) in 2 physiognomic types (basin and fringe) were collected during 2 seasons (dry and rainy). Probability distribution and first-derivative plots were generated for every wavelength (450-1,000 nm) detected in all samples. With the plots, optimal wavelengths were selected and subsequently verified with a canonical discriminant analysis. Results indicated that all species in basin mangrove forests showed a unique distinction between the upper and lower leaves during the dry season. By contrast, species in fringe mangrove forests did not show this difference during both seasons. Optimal wavelengths for species discrimination were located between 540-560 nm and 700-720 nm, which correspond to the green and red-edge wavebands, respectively. Future studies using remote sensing data with the aforementioned wavebands can be conducted to discriminate physiognomic mangrove forest types and to increase accuracy in the classification of mangroves at the canopy level on the Pacific coast of Mexico.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quasi-global, medium-resolution land surface models - the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model (SRTM1 DEM), the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global DEM (ASTER GDEM), and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3D digital surface model (AW3D30 DSM) - are widely used in geosciences. We carried out a comparative analysis of accuracy for these models exemplified by the Zaoksky testing ground, Central European Russia. First, we extracted related portions from the SRTM1 DEM, ASTER GDEM, and AW3D30 DSM for the study area. In the further analysis, we used 69 ground control points (GCPs) within the testing ground, as well as a reference DEM photogrammetrically generated from aerial stereo images. For each GCP, we determined an elevation value in four models and a related vertical error. For each model, we carried out a statistical analysis of vertical errors. To visualize the spatial distribution of vertical errors, we calculated matrices of residuals between the reference DEM and the quasi-global models. The results demonstrate that the AW3D30 DSM can be considered the most accurate quasi-global, medium-resolution land surface model. We do not recommend the use of the ASTER GDEM because it is marked by high errors with chaotically distributed hummock-like patterns.

AB  - In the past the effect of soil roughness was often considered secondary within the determination of soil moisture from remote sensing data. Several studies showed that accurate determination of soil roughness leads to an improved estimation of soil moisture. Two standard parameters in microwave sensing to describe the surface roughness are the standard deviation of the surface height variation s and the surface correlation length l with its corresponding autocorrelation function (ACF). Both parameters (s, l) affect the emissivity measured by radiometers as well as the backscattering observed by radars. In this study, we develop a physics-based approach to retrieve s and l by combining both microwave signals based on active-passive microwave covariation. To test the approach, containing a forward model and a retrieval algorithm, we used active/passive microwave data measured with the ComRAD truck-based SMAP simulator at L-band. Results and validations with corresponding field measurements on ground show that s and l can be estimated when using this approach. The physics-based retrieval algorithm works robustly for two investigated test fields having an RMS-Error of 0.68 cm and 0.69 cm between the microwave-based and field-measured s-values, and of 3.13 cm and 3.04 cm for l-values. Validation of the results reveals that the influence of the ACF, needed within the retrieval, is distinct.

TI  - Assessing the Benefits of Simulated RADARSAT Constellation Mission Polarimetry Images for Structural Mapping of an Impact Crater in the Canadian Shield
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional polarization architectures transmit and receive linear polarizations (LL). Canada's RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) will be equipped with a hybrid architecture that will transmit a circular polarization and receive linear polarizations (CL). The objective of this study is to assess the benefits of CL polarization images, in comparison to LL, for automated structural mapping in Canadian Shield terrain. RADARSAT-2 data acquired over the Manicouagan impact crater are used to simulate RCM data through the Natural Resources Canada RCM-CP (compact polarimetric) v3 program. Circular transmit/receive (CC) polarization images were also generated and included in this study. The structural mapping benefits of each polarization architecture have been assessed via comparisons with a manually inferred fault map, escarpment map, and optical data illustrating faults indicated through extended linear waterbodies. The results demonstrate that the CL and LL architectures provide a complementary overview of the structural geology. CL, in relation to LL, provides a greater spatial extent of lineaments, better optimizes faults expressed through linear waterbodies, and highlights the largest number of manually inferred faults, while LL better recognizes faults related to moderate relief. We conclude that RCM's CL architecture will provide an additional benefit for structural mapping in the Canadian Shield and equivalent terrains.

AB  - Chile has a large number of endemic species due to its isolated location, which are increasingly endangered by a variety of invasive species. This development is further intensified by high disturbance rates. In this study, we evaluate a Sentinel-2 time-series of one phenological cycle in 2016 and additional geo-information from TanDEM-X as well as infrastructure and soil data to detect the spread of Ulex europaeus onto agricultural areas with a one-class classifier (MaxEnt) and a non-negative least square (nnls) unmixing algorithm. The results were validated with UAS-based image mosaics acquired in March 2016.First results led to overall accuracies of up to R-2 = 0.7 for Ulex europaeus for the linear unmixing and overall accuracies between 79 % and 89 % for the one-class classifier, depending on the included data-set. The mapped pattern reflects the observed on-field spreading pattern on the Isla de Chiloe (Chiloe Island) quite well, showing the most affected areas in the more intense agriculturally used north-east of the island. Furthermore, the results were notably influenced more by the included data-sets than by the detection method. Generally, an increased number of Sentinel-2 images as well as additional geo-information improved the performance.

M3  - Observational Study
AB  - BACKGROUND: Melanoma is one of the conditions with greater increase in incidence worldwide in recent decades. It is a skin cancer with potential high lethality and predominates in Caucasian adults. Treatment of primary cutaneous melanoma is essentially surgical and search for sentinel lymph node can modify the aggressiveness of the treatment.OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiological profile of patients diagnosed with primary cutaneous melanoma, histopathological features and compare with literature data.METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational, single-center, case series study of patients with primary cutaneous melanoma, who underwent surgery between January 2008 and December 2013. The parameters include: Age, sex, clinical stage, date of surgery, tumor location, histological subtype, condition of surgical margins, Breslow thickness, mitotic index, presence of ulceration and metastasis on admission.RESULTS: We included 321 melanoma patients who were treated at Hospital Erasto Gaertner. The population consisted of 58.9% females and 41.1% males with an average age of 52.8 ± 16.3 years. As for the clinical stage, 51.1% were in the initial stage, 24.3% in the clinical stage II (A, B and C), 21.2% in clinical stage III and 3.4% with distant metastases. The most frequent location of the primary melanoma was the trunk, and the histological subtype was superficial spreading pattern. Intermediate and thick melanomas were the most frequent.STUDY LIMITATIONS: This is a retrospective study and some information and data could be incomplete or absent.CONCLUSION: The diagnosis and treatment of melanoma in early stages provides less morbidity and improved survival of patients. Understanding the biological behavior of tumor and knowing the local epidemiology guide health strategies.

AB  - Grassland degradation is a process according to which occurs loss of productivity, nutritional value and natural recovery capacity. The geoprocessing techniques to identify different levels of degradation through consistent data and repeated measurements. The objective of this research was to use Vegetation Indexes (NDVI) to detect degradation processes of pastures grown in the municipality of Colorado do Oeste - RO. For the study, were used OLI/Landsat satellite images 8 scenes 230/69 and 229/69 for the year 2015, with subsequent verification of a field of pasture conditions. The indexes indicated that 66.69% of the municipality present pastures with some degree of degradation. Of this percentage, 35.19% were classified with moderately (Grassland 3), 24.88% strongly (Grassland 2) and 6.62%, extremely degraded (Grassland 1), and only 33.30% of the pastures in the study area are in adequate production conditions. The methodology used was satisfactory for differentiation of pasture degradation levels.

TI  - NDVI and meteorological data as indicators of the Pampa biome natural grasslands growth
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - ABSTRACT The present study aimed to characterize the dynamics of NDVI and meteorological conditions, relating both to the annual dynamics of biomass accumulation in natural pastures of the Pampa biome as a way of subsidizing growth modeling. Forage accumulation rate data from a long-term experiment, NDVI data from the MODIS images, and meteorological data measured at the surface were used. We verify that the agrometeorological element associated to the accumulation of forage in the natural grasslands is different according to the season, which is typical of the subtropical climate. Winter is the critical season for livestock production due to the lower forage accumulation rate and lower values of NDVI, conditioned by the decrease of solar radiation and air temperature. In the summer, the limiting factor to forage accumulation is the hydric condition. It was also verified that the variability in the growth of grasslands can be associated with the ENSO phenomenon, being the El Nino favorable and the La Nina unfavorable, especially in the spring-summer period. Considering the verified associations, spectral indices combined with agrometeorological elements are recommended to the adjustment of models of forage accumulation in the Pampa biome natural grasslands.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - In this work we investigate urban reconstruction and propose a complete and automatic framework for reconstructing urban areas from remote sensing data.Firstly, we address the complex problem of semantic labeling and propose a novel network architecture named SegNeXT which combines the strengths of deep-autoencoders with feed forward links in generating smooth predictions and reducing the number of learning parameters, with the effectiveness which cardinality-enabled residual-based building blocks have shown in improving prediction accuracy and outperforming deeper/wider network architectures with a smaller number of learning parameters. The network is trained with benchmark datasets and the reported results show that it can provide at least similar and in some cases better classification than state-of-the-art.Secondly, we address the problem of urban reconstruction and propose a complete pipeline for automatically converting semantic labels into virtual representations of the urban areas. An agglomerative clustering is performed on the points according to their classification and results in a set of contiguous and disjoint clusters. Finally, each cluster is processed according to the class it belongs: tree clusters are substituted with procedural models, cars are replaced with simplified CAD models, buildings' boundaries are extruded to form 3D models, and road, low vegetation, and clutter clusters are triangulated and simplified.The result is a complete virtual representation of the urban area. The proposed framework has been extensively tested on large-scale benchmark datasets and the semantic labeling and reconstruction results are reported.

AB  - As more and more geospatial data are produced, Big Earth data is becoming a new key to the understanding of the Earth. Such opportunity also comes with new issues and challenges related to the massive and heteregenous amount of data to process and to analyse. The present work explores the use of three types of Earth Observation (EO) data in order to automatically classify built and non-built areas in Africa using a machine learning classifier : SAR (Sentinel) and optical (Landsat) imagery, and the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database as training data. Experimental results in ten african cities show that the use of satellite data from multiple sensors improves the performance of the classifiers in these areas. They also show that using crowd-sourced geospatial databases such as OSM as training data leads to similar accuracies than when relying on field surveys or hand-digitalized datasets.

TI  - Modernization of Blackbody Temperature Control for the Enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS)
T2  - 2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Aerospace Conference
CL  - Big Sky, MT
AB  - This paper describes a modernization effort to a critical subsystem onboard NASA's Enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS). A new Blackbody Temperature Controller subsystem greatly improves eMAS' infrared-imaging calibration and offers substantial gains in measurement and control performance. Reductions in Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) over prior instrument hardware are also achieved. Real-time control from the ground via the NASA Airborne Science Sensor Net is enabled by the ARM-based, embedded controller. A linear-drive stage delivers 140W peak power to a Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC) array for the blackbody. The paper details the rationale for selection of a linear power stage and corresponding analyses and prototyping that traded PWM versus linear methods. Linear drive is often considered grossly inefficient; a deeper analysis and novel packaging techniques indicate otherwise for this specific application. A survey of high-performance, temperature-measurement techniques reveals that new System-on-Chip (SoC) offerings substantially reduce complexity over prior state-of-the-art with little compromise in performance. Packaging volume of the new technology also radically shrinks. Lab results indicate measurement readout-noise (15mK, 3 sigma) improvements over legacy eMAS hardware. Selection of the temperature sensor and NIST-traceable calibration yields an overall systematic error of 60mK typical, 141mK worst-case. A full measurement system error budget is presented. The measurement stability aids performance and tuning of the control algorithm, also discussed. Two controllers have been built and integrated into the instrument in preparation for the upcoming deployment season.The new development is best understood in the context of the eMAS whiskbroom imager, its infrared capability, and the implementation of its blackbody infrared references. The blackbodies are built using circular plates of copper, coated with a special, high-emissivity paint that appears diffuse at infrared wavelengths. A pair of references on either side of the spectrometer's field of view provides an in-system, two-point calibration every scan line. An array of TEC modules is sandwiched between each plate and a forced-air cooled heatsink. A single sensor is read out at high precision with room for a coarse, auxiliary channel.Historically, temperature readout and control of these references were performed with a system mounted far from the spectrometer optical bench. Low-level analog signals were sent over long (10') cables in close proximity to the TEC array's high-current drive. This rendered the temperature measurement highly susceptible to systematic noise. The legacy system also utilized an analog control loop that could not be tuned or modified over time. The new controller leverages modern embedded system techniques to radically shrink the packaging volume and enable real-time control. Low-noise methods and clever thermal management allow the controller to be placed in close proximity to the reference plate. The overall result is an improvement in performance, reduction in system volume, and a drop in weight. Aircraft managers always welcome a weight reduction for airborne sensors; however, the eMAS technicians tasked with repeatedly installing the system are the real beneficiaries. Overall, the modernization effort represents a major step forward for this unique NASA Airborne Science asset.

TI  - Landsat-8 vs. Sentinel-2: examining the added value of sentinel-2's red-edge bands to land-use and land-cover mapping in Burkina Faso
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of freely available moderate-to-high spatial resolution (10-30m) satellite imagery received a major boost with the recent launch of the Sentinel-2 sensor by the European Space Agency. Together with Landsat, these sensors provide the scientific community with a wide range of spatial, spectral, and temporal properties. This study compared and explored the synergistic use of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data in mapping land use and land cover (LULC) in rural Burkina Faso. Specifically, contribution of the red-edge bands of Sentinel-2 in improving LULC mapping was examined. Three machine-learning algorithms - random forest, stochastic gradient boosting, and support vector machines - were employed to classify different data configurations. Classification of all Sentinel-2 bands as well as Sentinel-2 bands common to Landsat-8 produced an overall accuracy, that is 5% and 4% better than Landsat-8. The combination of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 red-edge bands resulted in a 4% accuracy improvement over that of Landsat-8. It was found that classification of the Sentinel-2 red-edge bands alone produced better and comparable results to Landsat-8 and the other Sentinel-2 bands, respectively. Results of this study demonstrate the added value of the Sentinel-2 red-edge bands and encourage multi-sensoral approaches to LULC mapping in West Africa.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Long-range airborne geophysical measurements were carried out in the ICEGRAV campaigns, covering hitherto unexplored parts of interior East Antarctica and part of the Antarctic Peninsula. The airborne surveys provided a regional coverage of gravity, magnetic and icepenetrating radar measurements for major Dronning Maud Land ice stream systems, from the grounding lines up to the Recovery Lakes drainage basin, and filled in major data voids in Antarctic data compilations, such as AntGP for gravity data, ADMAP for magnetic data and BEDMAP2 for ice thickness data and the sub-ice topography. We present the first maps of gravity, magnetic and ice thickness data and bedrock topography for the region and show examples of bedrock topography and basal reflectivity patterns. The 2013 Recovery Lakes campaign was carried out with a British Antarctic Survey Twin Otter aircraft operating from the Halley and Belgrano II stations, as well as a remote field camp located at the Recovery subglacial Lake B site. Gravity measurements were the primary driver for the survey, with two airborne gravimeters (Lacoste and Romberg and Chekan-AM) providing measurements at an accuracy level of around 2 mGal r.m.s., supplementing GOCE (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer) satellite data and confirming an excellent sub-milligal agreement between satellite and airborne data at longer wavelengths.

TI  - The 3MI mission on-board EPS-SG - A Multi-Spectral Multi Polarization Multi-Directional Imager for operational characterization of aerosol and cloud
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The 3MI instrument is one of the missions of the EPS-SG program to be launched in 2021. This polarimetric mission is a heritage of the POLDER mission, with improved capabilities and now placed in a fully operational long-term framework. The spectral range was extended from the visible-near-infrared (410 to 910nm) to the shortwave infrared domain (up to 2200nm). The spatial resolution (4km at nadir) and the swath (2200x2200km(2)) were also improved compared to previous POLDER instruments. The 3MI concept of the multi-viewing, multi-spectral and multi polarized Imaging will be described, especially how these 3 information are acquired together with one instrumental concept that remains simple. The performance necessary to meet the mission requirements will be initially reached before launch through a fully dedicated ground campaign and maintained once in orbit through an extensive vicarious calibration strategy. The level 1 products available to the users will be geolocated Stokes vectors on the native geometry (Level 1B) and geoprojected multi-directional and spectral Stokes vectors (Level 1C). Level-2 products will provide geophysical and microphysical parameters for aerosol and clouds. The presentation will detail the 3MI concept, overview the mission characteristics, and browse the foreseen ground campaign and in-flight strategy necessary to reach the performance, as well as the products available to the users.

AB  - Recent development by European Space Agency (ESA) involved the extension of the interferometric capabilities of the SentiNel Application Platform (SNAP) to enable SAR interferometric time series analysis through the Stanford Method of Persistent Scatterer (StaMPS) software package. In the current work, we demonstrate the enabled Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) processing of Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission data through SNAP-StaMPS integrated processing. A detailed overview of the processing steps involved as well as considerations and assumptions to exploit the SNAP-StaMPS synergy are presented. We intend to support the Earth Observation community by providing guidelines for Sentinel-1 TOPS data PSI processing using open source software packages. We demonstrate the SNAP functionality by processing two stacks of Sentinel-1 products over Mexico City (Mexico) and Rome (Italy).

AB  - Accurate and timely crop yield forecasts are critical for making informed agricultural policies and investments, as well as increasing market efficiency and stability. In Becker-Reshef et al. (2010) and Franch et al. (2015) we developed an empirical generalized model for forecasting winter wheat yield. In this study we present a new model based on the extrapolation of the pure wheat signal (100% of wheat within the pixel) from MODIS data at 1km resolution and using the Difference Vegetation Index (DVI). The model has been applied to monitor the national and state level yield of winter wheat in the United States from 2001 to 2016.

TI  - Christian ethos secondary schools in England and Wales: a common voice or wide diversity?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BELIEFS & VALUES-STUDIES IN RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study argues that it is the collective worldview of the students which is crucial in reflecting and shaping the ethos of schools. In order to understand the potential distinctiveness of Christian ethos schools two analyses were undertaken. The collective worldview of 2942 students attending 10 Christian ethos schools was compared with the collective worldview of 13,861 students attending 71 schools without a religious character. Then the collective worldview of 194 students attending an Anglican school that prioritised the Church's 'domestic' function in education was compared with the collective worldview of 302 students attending an Anglican school that prioritised the Church's 'general' function in education. The major difference occurs not between Christian ethos schools and schools without a religious character, but between Anglican schools that voice their interpretation of the Church's mission in education differently.

TI  - VEGETATION RATES OBTAINED FROM MULTISPECTRIC IMAGES APPLIED IN THE DISCRIMINATION OF VEGETABLE COVERAGE IN MOUNTAIN RELIEF
T2  - GEO UERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation indices are used to investigate the properties of spectral vegetation and can be related to the biophysics parameters. In addition, they can also be used to minimize illumination effects caused by the topographic on spectral response that difficult to distinguish vegetation physiognomy. To evaluate the efficiency of vegetation indices to distinguish the vegetation cover in mountainous area, it was calculated two indices from LANDSAT8/ OLI multispectral bands that cover the Tijuca Massif, situated on central zone of Rio de Janeiro city. The results revealed that the both vegetation indices (NDVI and SR) had efficiency to separate water bodies and to discriminate vegetation and non-vegetation classes. However, the urban area, shadows and rocks were mixed, while it was not possible to classify the vegetation physiognomy because of the effect solar illumination on the vegetation indices. The forest located at southern slopes, which received less solar illumination at the time the orbital sensor collected the data, had indices similar to herbaceous vegetation, and in this way it was not possible to separate them. While the forest located at northern and western, which were received more solar illumination, had the most elevated indices and it was not confused with other types of land cover. In conclusion, the indices vegetation (IVDN and SR) were not efficient to minimize the topographic effects to discriminate the vegetation physiognomy. On other hand, the indices showed efficient to demonstrate that watersheds located at protected area had more elevated indices than the basin located near de urban area.

TI  - Wetland classification using Radarsat-2 SAR quad-polarization and Landsat-8 OLI spectral response data: a case study in the Hudson Bay Lowlands Ecoregion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Circumboreal Canadian bogs and fens distinguished by differences in soils, hydrology, vegetation and morphological features were classified using combinations of Radarsat-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) quad-polarization data and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) spectral response patterns. Separate classifications were conducted using a traditional pixel-based maximum likelihood classifer and a machine learning algorithm following an object-based image analysis (OBIA). This study focused on two wetland classes with extensive coverage in the area (bog and fen). In the pixel-based maximum likelihood classification, accuracy increased from approximately 69% user's accuracy and 79% producer's accuracy using Radarsat-2 SAR data alone to approximately 80% user's accuracy and 87% producer's accuracy using Landsat-8 OLI data alone. Use of the Radarsat-2 SAR and Landsat-8 OLI data following principal components analysis (PCA) data fusion did not result in higher pixel-based maximum likelihood classification accuracy. In the object-based machine learning classification, higher bog and fen class accuracies were obtained when using Radarsat-2 and Landsat OLI data individually compared to the equivalent pixel-based classification. Subsequently, a PCA-data fusion product outperformed the individual bands of the Radarsat-2 and Landsat-8 imagery in object-based classification. Greater than 90% producer's accuracy was obtained. The margin of error (MOE) was less than 5% in all classifications reported here. Further research will examine alternative data fusion techniques and the addition of Radarsat-2 SAR interferometric digital elevation model (DEM)-based geomorphometrics in object-based classification of different morphological types of bogs and fens.

AB  - Snow accumulation is one of the most important forms of water storage. The natural cycle of water is being increasingly influenced by climate change and will continue to change in the future. To understand the evolution of snow cover and to perfect its accurate detection UN Environment/GRID-Geneva and the University of Geneva have developed a Snow Detection tool called "Snow Observations from Space" for the Swiss Data Cube. The Snow Detection tool uses the C Function of Mask to identify snow pixels and then subsequently produces a normalized detection raster.Through further development, this tool will reach its full potential as an accurate method of detecting snow cover change for Switzerland.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules are considered the most reliable component of a photovoltaic system and according to the manufacturers have a lifetime from 25 to 30 years. However, some modules degrade or fail along their service time under outdoor exposure and harsh conditions. The reliability and lifetime of a module depend on its energy conversion performance and degradation modes. For better understanding of the mechanisms behind the degradation and failure of PV modules, this study reviews the governing degradation modes and investigates a ten-year-old operating crystalline silicon PV module installed at an active farm and animal sanctuary. Field current-voltage testing and Infrared imaging for hot spot detection have been employed in examining this PV module showing localized damaged regions. While new remote sensing tools are being deployed to monitor large-scale PV systems, this study provides a basic overview of PV reliability to small-scale community users. This work exemplifies academic-community collaborations in the field of sustainability. Published by AIP Publishing.

TI  - Clinical workflow optimization to improve 4DCT reconstruction for Toshiba Aquilion CT scanners
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR MEDIZINISCHE PHYSIK
M3  - Article
AB  - Respiratory motion remains a source of major uncertainties in radiotherapy. Respiratory correlated computed tomography (referred to as 4DCT) serves as one way of reducing breathing artifacts in 3D-CTs and allows the investigation of tumor motion over time. The quality of the 4DCT images depends on the data acquisition scheme, which in turn is dependent on the vendor. Specifically, the only way Toshiba Aquilion LB CT scanners can reconstruct 4DCTs is a cycle-based reconstruction using triggers provided by an external surrogate signal. The accuracy is strongly dependent on the method of trigger generation. Two consecutive triggers are used to define a breathing cycle which is divided into respiratory phases of equal duration. The goal of this study is to identify if there are advantages in the usage of local-amplitude based sorting (LAS) of the respiration motion states, in order to reduce image artifacts and improve 4DCT quality. Furthermore, this study addresses the generation and optimization of a clinical workflow using as surrogate motion monitoring system the Sentinel (TM) (C-RAD AB, Sweden) optical surface scanner in combination with a Toshiba Aquilion LB CT scanner. For that purpose, a phantom study using 10 different breathing waveforms and a retrospective patient study using the 4DCT reconstructions of 10 different patients has been conducted. The error in tumor volume has been reduced from 2.9 +/- 3.7% to 2.7 +/- 2.6% using optimal cycle-based triggers (manipulated CBS) and to 2.7 +/- 2.2% using LAS in the phantom study. Moreover, it was possible to decrease the tumor volume variability from 5.0 +/- 3.6% using the original cycle-based triggers (original CBS) to 3.5 +/- 2.5% using the optimal triggers and to 3.7 +/- 2.7% using LAS in the patient data analysis. We therefore propose the usage of the manipulated CBS, also with regard to an accurate and safe clinical workflow.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Water temperatures are crucial for biological and physiological processes and are an integral part of water quality monitoring. Thermal infrared remote sensing can help to acquire extensive temperature information at low cost, but for inland water bodies, the available satellite data often has an insufficient spatial resolution to monitor water surface temperatures (WST). Hence, thermal sharpening to increase temperature data availability is evaluated in this study. Landsat-8 TIRS data was sharpened based on land cover information from Landsat-8 OLI data and a gyrocopter survey over the research area in Koblenz, Germany. This area presents a challenging composition of two rivers, infrastructure, urban and vegetation areas. The water and non-water pixels were identified with a pixel based, two-step modified parallelpiped classification algorithm.The sharpening water thermal imagery (SWTI) algorithm is available for water bodies to unmix temperatures of water-land boundary pixels based on the relation between their radiance and land cover composition. It was modified in order to test its applicability to the research area. Two auxiliary datasets were used to investigate the effect of large resolution differences between temperature and land cover data. In most cases the SWTI improves the RMSE and in all cases reduces the average difference of the Landsat-8 compared to reference WST. The quality of the results depends mainly on the congruency of the input data. The SWTI also proved to be superior to the cubic convolution algorithm when increasing the spatial resolution over water areas and reduced the required minimum river width.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Day and employment services provided by state intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) agencies, with funding from Medicaid Home and Community Based Services (HCBS), have shown little growth in the employment rate of people with IDD. In attempt to prepare individuals with IDD for employment, prevocational services may be provided. The goal of prevocational is to develop or improve the job and non-job skills, develop work tolerance, and increase preparedness to have a job in a community based and/or competitive setting.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine how prevocational services were allocated in HCBS 1915(c) waivers for people with IDD across the United States in fiscal year (FY) 2014.METHODS: 111 HCBS IDD waivers were examined to determine if and how they provided prevocational services. Prevocational services were then compared to determine projected expenditures and service utilization.RESULTS: In FY 2014, approximately $750 million of funding was projected for prevocational services of approximately 87,500 participants; projected allocation varied widely by state and service.CONCLUSIONS: Without a clear pathway to competitive integrated employment, the very notion of prevocational services does not necessarily fit well within shifting policy paradigms that prioritize inclusion, competitive wages, and funding for integrated employment.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites are able to observe small and large scale structures in sea ice - in any weather, through clouds and darkness. In order to assist ship navigation during polar campaigns, we acquired SAR images along the ship course and provided them to navigators on board in near real time, utilizing the operational data processing chain of DLR ground station Neustrelitz. These "exclusive" acquisitions already helped to optimize the routes. SAR data, however, contain more information that is not easily visible, e.g. information about the local sea ice drift. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of a new software processor that is intended to retrieve high resolution sea ice drift fields from pairs of co-located SAR images, combining TerraSAR-X and Radarsat-2 images. The processor is foreseen to be integrated into the operational data processing chain at DLR ground station network sites.

AB  - The Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) in Lagrange-1 (L1) orbit provides observations of the Earth's surface lit by the Sun at a cadence of 13 to 22 images/day and optical resolution of 16 km in 10 spectral bands from 317 to 780 nm. The EPIC data collected in the bands centered on 443, 551, and 680 nm are used to estimate daily mean photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) reaching the surface of the global, ice-free oceans. The solar irradiance reaching the surface is obtained by subtracting from the extraterrestrial irradiance (known), the irradiance reflected to space (estimated from the EPIC measurements), while taking into account atmospheric transmission (modeled). Clear and cloudy regions within a pixel do not need to be distinguished, i.e., the methodology is adapted to the relatively large EPIC pixels. A first daily mean EPIC PAR imagery is generated. Comparison with estimates from sensors in polar and geostationary orbits, namely MODIS and AHI, shows good agreement, with coefficients of deteunination of 0.79 and 0.92 and RMS differences of 8.2 and 5.7 E/m(2)/d, respectively, but overestimation by 1.08 E/m(2)/d (MODIS) and 3.44 E/m(2)/d (AHI). The advantages of using observations from L1 orbit are: 1) the daily cycle of cloudiness is well described (unlike from polar orbit) and 2) spatial resolution is not significantly degraded at high latitudes (unlike from geostationary orbit). The methodology can be easily extended to estimate ultraviolet (UV) surface irradiance using the spectral bands centered on 317, 325, 340, and 388 nm, all the more as ozone content, a key variable controlling atmospheric transmittance, is retrieved from the measurements.

This study takes unscented particle filter (UPF) as an example to test its performance at different two probability distribution, Gaussian and Uniform distributions with two different assimilation frequencies experiments (1) assimilating hourly in situ soil surface temperature, (2) assimilating the original Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) once per day. The numerical experiment results show that the filter performs better when increasing the assimilation frequency. In addition, UPF is efficient for improving the soil variables (e. g., soil temperature) simulation/prediction accuracy, though it is not sensitive to the probability distribution for observation error in soil temperature assimilation.

TI  - Analysis of influence of observation operator on sequential data assimilation through soil temperature simulation with common land model
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - An observation operator is a bridge linking the system state vector and observations in a data assimilation system. Despite its importance, the degree to which an observation operator influences the performance of data assimilation methods is still poorly understood. This study aimed to analyze the influences of linear and nonlinear observation operators on the sequential data assimilation through soil temperature simulation using the unscented particle filter (UPF) and the common land model. The linear observation operator between unprocessed simulations and observations was first established. To improve the correlation between simulations and observations, both were processed based on a series of equations. This processing essentially resulted in a nonlinear observation operator. The linear and nonlinear observation operators were then used along with the UPF in three assimilation experiments: an hourly in situ soil surface temperature assimilation, a daily in situ soil surface temperature assimilation, and a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) assimilation. The results show that the filter improved the soil temperature simulation significantly with the linear and nonlinear observation operators. The nonlinear observation operator improved the UPF's performance more significantly for the hourly and daily in situ observation assimilations than the linear observation operator did, while the situation was opposite for the MODIS LST assimilation. Because of the high assimilation frequency and data quality, the simulation accuracy was significantly improved in all soil layers for hourly in situ soil surface temperature assimilation, while the significant improvements of the simulation accuracy were limited to the lower soil layers for the assimilation experiments with low assimilation frequency or low data quality.

AB  - Remote sensing data is an important way to reflect the comprehensive information of surface. In this paper, based on the semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images, a segmentation method based on full convolutional neural network (FCN) is proposed. The method improves the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) and replaces the final fully connected layer of the CNN network with a convolutional layer. And then optimize the convolution operation by using the matrix expansion technique. The experimental results show that the FCN network with sufficient training and fine-tuning can effectively perform automatic semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images. The correct segmentation accuracy is higher than 85%, which improves the efficiency of convolution operations.

AB  - To make better use of the advantages of radar and promote the application of image fusion based on radar data, the author uses different fusion methods based on GF-3 SAR and GF-1 MSS, and evaluates the fusion results by analyzing mean, variance, information entropy, average gradient, spectral distortion and correlation coefficient. The results show that HSV and GS transforms have the best performances in overall. PC is recognized as the third, while it is still remarkable that it has the best ability of spectral retention. And the specialty in NIR band makes PC more conducive for extraction of vegetation. Brovey and Multiplicative transforms are not effective in comparison.

TI  - Sedimentary and geochemical characteristics of two small permafrost-dominated Arctic river deltas in northern Alaska.
T2  - Arktos : the journal of arctic geosciences
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Arctic river deltas are highly dynamic environments in the northern circumpolar permafrost region that are affected by fluvial, coastal, and permafrost-thaw processes. They are characterized by thick sediment deposits containing large but poorly constrained amounts of frozen organic carbon and nitrogen. This study presents new data on soil organic carbon and nitrogen storage as well as accumulation rates from the Ikpikpuk and Fish Creek river deltas, two small, permafrost-dominated Arctic river deltas on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska. A soil organic carbon storage of 42.4±1.6 and 37.9±3.5kg C m-2 and soil nitrogen storage of 2.1±0.1 and 2.0±0.2kg N m-2 was found for the first 2m of soil for the Ikpikpuk and Fish Creek river delta, respectively. While the upper meter of soil contains 3.57TgC, substantial amounts of carbon (3.09 Tg C or 46%) are also stored within the second meter of soil (100-200cm) in the two deltas. An increasing and inhomogeneous distribution of C with depth is indicative of the dominance of deltaic depositional rather than soil forming processes for soil organic carbon storage. Largely, mid- to late Holocene radiocarbon dates in our cores suggest different carbon accumulation rates for the two deltas for the last 2000years. Rates up to 28g C m-2 year-1 for the Ikpikpuk river delta are about twice as high as forthe Fish Creek river delta. With this study, we highlight the importance of including these highly dynamic permafrost environments in future permafrost carbon estimations.

AB  - One of the elements of the urban plans for adapting to climate change is to identify the range the urban heat island (UHI). To a relatively rare ground station network air temperature, one of the possible methods to identify this phenomenon in cities is the analysis of satellite images, and in particular the thermal images surface cities in conjunction with the land-use structure. In the publication is presented the application of indirect methods of determining surface characteristics of heat island in the cities of Upper Silesia Agglomeration on the basis of the analysis of the thermal images from the satellite Landsat for the period 1986-2016. It presents ways to interpret these images depending on the needs of determination the areas sensitive to the impact of the (UHI) and define the areas where adaptation actions to the climate change should be undertaken.

AB  - In cancer immunotherapy, the importance of tumor microenvironment (TME) has recently been highlighted. TME, where trafficked T lymphocytes with tumoricidal activity, particularly endowed by dendritic cells in the sentinel lymph nodes, suppress cancer cells, consists of multiple cellular components, such as fibroblasts, macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, monocytes, neutrophils, regulatory T cells, and NK cells, and non-cellular components, such as extracellular matrix and blood and lymphatic vessels. These stroma-forming components have been demonstrated to be mutually interrelated and to provide pro-cancer propensity. The recent clinical success of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer treatment has again highlighted the importance of controlling the immunosuppressive milieu of TME to achieve an improved clinical outcome. Simultaneously, understanding the unsuccessful clinical efficacy mediated by adoptively transferred cancer antigen receptor gene-modified T cells against solid tumors has similarly drawn a conclusion. This review presents some recent and notable progresses in cancer immunotherapy, thus aiming at an opportunity to understand the interrelation between tumor immunity in cancer-bearing host and TME.

AB  - Allergic skin and respiratory diseases range among the most frequent afflictions in industrialized countries. Due to this fact the importance of indoor mold pollution based on dampness is discussed. In a sentinel health study of the State Health Agency (LGA) children attending of 4th grade of a primary school were tested by an in-vitro allergy screening (UniCap 100/Phadia) for the mold allergens mx1 (Penicillium chrysogenum m1, Cladosporium herbarum m2, Aspergillus fumigatus m3 and Alternaria alternata m6). Primarily about 5% of the children were sensitized against molds which are associated with the ambient air. The investigations showed that most of the children were sensitized against Alternaria alternata and concerning the IgE-concentration (kU/l) Alternaria alternata had the highest concentration among the tested allergens. Commonly children with sensitization against molds were polysensitized. It is unclear if the allergy screening against mold mx1 includes molds with indication for indoor mold pollution such as Acremonium spp., Aspergillus penicillioides, Aspergillus restrictus, Aspergillus versicolor, Chaetomium spp., Phialophora spp., Stachybotrys chartarum, Tritirachium (Engyodontium) album und Trichoderma spp. by means of crossreaction. Therefore, such investigations do not admit any conclusion about health problems as a result of indoor mold pollution. At the present state of knowledge exposure measurements of indoor mold pollutions are not possible, at most a semiquantitative assessment. Although it is generally accepted that dwellings with moisture and mold represent a health risk, knowledge about indoor mold pollution and the related health problems is lacking.

AB  - PurposeThe Heart Protection Study 2Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events (HPS2-THRIVE) trial found higher incidence rates of adverse reactions, including bleeding, in patients receiving the combination of extended-release niacin and laropiprant versus placebo. It is not known whether these adverse events are attributable to laropiprant, not approved in the USA, or to extended-release niacin. We compared rates of major gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage among initiators of extended-release niacin and initiators of fenofibrate.MethodsWe used Mini-Sentinel (now Sentinel) to conduct an observational, new user cohort analysis. We included data from 5 Data Partners covering the period from January 1, 2007 to August 31, 2013. Individuals who initiated extended-release niacin were propensity score-matched to individuals who initiated fenofibrate. Within the matched cohorts, we used Cox proportional hazards models to compare rates of hospitalization for major gastrointestinal bleeding events and intracranial hemorrhage assessed using validated claims-based algorithms.ResultsA total of 234242 eligible extended-release niacin initiators were identified, of whom 210 389 (90%) were 1:1 propensity score-matched to eligible fenofibrate initiators. In propensity score-matched analyses, no differences were observed between exposure groups in rates of major gastrointestinal bleeding (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.18) or intracranial hemorrhage (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.66 to 2.22). Results were similar in pre-specified sensitivity and subgroup analyses.ConclusionsWe did not observe evidence for an association between extended-release niacin versus fenofibrate and rates of major gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.

TI  - Detection of Gossan Zones in Arid Regions Using Landsat 8 OLI Data: Implication for Mineral Exploration in the Eastern Arabian Shield, Saudi Arabia
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Gossans (Fe-rich alteration zones) are the surface indications of massive sulfide, porphyry and skarn deposits in the Arabian Nubian Shield. They consist of limonite, goethite, hematite, malachite, and azurite. The Khunayqiyah gossans, Eastern Arabian Shield, Saudi Arabia, have been used to demonstrate the effectiveness of using the Landsat 8 OLI imagery for detecting and delineating of gossan zones in arid regions. The Khunayqiyah gossans have diagnostic spectral features, and they are often larger than the pixel size of the Landsat 8 OLI images. Remote sensing techniques in this study include pan sharpening, principal component analysis (PCA), minimum noise fraction (MNF), and band ratio. The RGB (red, green, blue) color composites of pan-sharpened original bands (4, 3, 2), PCA (PC3, PC2, PC1) and MNF (MNF2, MNF4, MNF3) images were found to be the most useful to delineate gossan/alteration zones in the Khunayqiyah district. The obtained results show reasonable matches between the spectra of collected samples and image-derived spectra from Landsat 8 data. Notably, the use of above-mentioned technique for mineral exploration is facilitated by the arid environment. The results of this study demonstrate Landsat 8 OLI images and the above-mentioned technique are useful in the exploration of new gossan occurrences in the Arabian Nubian Shield and other arid regions worldwide where little in situ geological data exist.

AB  - In this paper, the spatial-temporal landscape pattern changes of Qingyang city were analyzed based on landscape pattern indices from the classified remotely sensed data of 2000, 2006 and 2012. The future landscape pattern in 2018 was predicted using the CA-Markov model. The results suggested that cropland, forestland, and grassland dominated the landscape pattern in Qingyang city, with a total percentage of more than 90%, and the area of unused land, construction land, and water body area successively decreased. During the period from 2000 to 2012, the percentage of cropland kept on reduced while those of other landscape types showed an upward trend, especially the grassland with the highest increase rate because of the policy of returning cropland back to forestland and grassland. Moreover, the patch numbers, as well as the fragmentation degree of cropland, forestland, and grassland were larger than other landscape types. During the period from 2000 to 2012, the patch density of cropland, forestland, and construction land presented a growing trend, and the landscape of cropland, forestland and grassland were spottily distributed. The natural connectivity of blocks was relatively high, and the degree of patch aggregation in grassland and construction land increased, of which the construction land had more changes. The prediction results based on the CA-Markov model indicated that the cropland would continue to decrease in 2018, and the other five landscape types would keep on increasing in Qingyang city. Under this trend, the cropland, forestland, and grassland are still the dominant types in this study area. This study can contribute to decision-making on ecological environmental protection and land use planning in Qingyang City.

AB  - Archaeological monuments are an essential part of the cultural landscape. Modern condition of archaeological monuments of the Republic of Tatarstan is discussed in this article. Fortified settlements, with the system of defensive fortifications were selected as the objects of study, as they are easily identified by remote sensing data. Due to the fact, that most of monuments are located on the small rivers banks, the first task of our study was to assess the risk of their destruction by natural processes. The second objective was to evaluate the role of the human factor in archaeological sites destruction. One of the main used methods is archival and modern remote sensing data analysis that also made able to correct the form of study settlements in comparison with existing plans as well as their size and location in the landscape. The results of research will help to identify trends in monuments state and to quantify the risks of their destruction.

AB  - The modern world faces numerous challenges that ultimately have a worldview nature. Every person included in the global processes meets with many contradictions, the settlement of which determines the direction of different communities and the whole of mankind movement. Globalization which began and was initially conceived as a process of world economic, political, cultural integration, rapprochement of peoples, over time began to demonstrate its negative aspects: socio-cultural unification, standardization of human tastes and preferences, stereotyping of people's habits and behavior, weakening of traditional values and ties. At present globalization is opposed to a relatively new process of extending glocalization as the desire to avoid the extremes of globalization, to prevent the disappearance of regional differences, to preserve and strengthen economic independence and cultural identity. This inevitably puts a human being and the whole mankind not only in front of the need of extensive scientific, technical and technological, social and humanitarian knowledge, but also requires the development of the ability to comprehend the whole array of diverse knowledge obtained in order to efficiently, in activity-based way use them. Therefore, alongside with general ideas about the world, the important task is integration of diverse modern humanitarian knowledge into the overall humanitarian picture of the world. The article examines some key methodological issues of the formation of the humanitarian world picture, including the problems of the language worldview, and focuses on the teaching of the experimental course "Humanitarian picture of the world" in the framework of the model of practice-oriented training of Russian pedagogical staff.

TI  - RED WEDDINGS IN BASHKIRIA: THE EXPERIMENTS OF SOVIET POWER
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The author analyses the introduction of the Soviet civil ceremony of "Red" weddings in postwar Bashkiria in order to eliminate religious beliefs, ethnic customs, and territorial differences by means of uniting youth for the purpose of solving existing social problems. The author refers to Bashkir periodicals of the 1920s, field materials, funds of the national archive of the Republic of Bashkortostan, and publications on the ethnography of the peoples of the republic. Red weddings in Bashkiria were first mentioned on 2 October 1923. In 1924, they were organised in towns, canton centres, and factory settlements among Komsomol members, non-party people, and clerks. In rural areas, attempts to impose new rituals on the public failed. As was explained by Bashkir newspapers, Komsomol leaders in the countryside were economically dependent on their parents and had to agree to their conditions. Additionally, this failure to introduce new practices was explained by the fact that it proved impossible to "develop" and "bring up" one of the spouses, usually a non-Komsomol member. According to field and archival materials, rural areas continued observing their old traditions in the 1920s, keeping patriarchal customs, and conservative worldview. This was particularly true about the Bashkir Trans-Urals, which still preserved a nomadic lifestyle, polygamy, and bride price. In Priuralye Bashkir settlements, there were rare cases of so-called demonstration Red weddings. Overall, the author finds data about Red wedding practices among Russians, Bashkirs, Tatars, Ukrainians, Chuvash, and Estonians. By the late 1920s, Red weddings had stopped as they were discredited in the public's opinion and there had been a change in the political course of the country.

T2  - GEOFOCUS-REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE LA INFORMACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study determines glacial coverage changes in nevado Cayambe (Ecuador), for the period 1978-2009, using two different but supplementary sources of information. The first one is aerial photographs (period 1978-1999); the second one is Landsat imagery (period 1979-2009). Results reveal 23.85 km(2) of ice coverage at the beginning of the period and 15.36 km(2) at the end. Reduction percentage is 25.53 % for the years studied using aerial photographs and 25.58 % for the years studied using remote sensing imagery. These figures support a trend to reduction observed in other Ecuadorian equinoctial glaciers such as Iliniza Sur, Antisana, Cotopaxi and Chimborazo.

TI  - COGNITIVE ASPECTS OF ANTHROPOCENTRIC MODELING LINGUISTIC WORLDVIEW
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with the issue of one of centrisms - anthropocentrism in lexical space as a perspective of linguistic worldview. The article discusses three aspects of anthropocentrism in the language: at lexical level, at phraseological level, and at the level of evaluation category expressed in the language. The issue of anthropocentrism in language in the framework of Polish phraseology according to A. Pajdzinska and R. Tokarski is discussed. The research of four basic categories reflecting the structure of natural world: space - time - quantity and degree - intensity is undertaken. As a proof of anthropocentrism in language in the comprehension of these categories, examples of metaphorical expressions from different Slavic languages are given: Slovak, Polish, and Russian. Philosophical justification is given to the idea of anthropocentrism in a language that manifests itself at the level of metaphorical expressions and is represented in the form of value judgments by means of "humanizing" comparisons, consisting in the notion that it is natural for a person to know the world around them through a prism of their own self, in particular through the prism of a physically perceptible body, through the prism of their own feelings, impressions and assessments.

TI  - A Land Product Characterization System for Comparative Analysis of Satellite Data and Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A Land Product Characterization System (LPCS) has been developed to provide land data and products to the community of individuals interested in validating space-based land products by comparing them with similar products available from other sensors or surface-based observations. The LPCS facilitates the application of global multi-satellite and in situ data for characterization and validation of higher-level, satellite-derived, land surface products (e.g., surface reflectance, normalized difference vegetation index, and land surface temperature). The LPCS includes data search, inventory, access, and analysis functions that will permit data to be easily identified, retrieved, co-registered, and compared statistically through a single interface. The system currently includes data and products available from Landsat 4 through 8, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua, Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP)/Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and simulated data for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). In addition to the future inclusion of in situ data, higher-level land products from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 and -3 series of satellites, and other high and medium resolution spatial sensors, will be included as available. When fully implemented, any of the sensor data or products included in the LPCS would be available for comparative analysis.

AB  - This work aims to improve the accuracy in Land Surface Temperature (LST) from single-channel thermal sensors by providing spatialized maps of transmittance, upwelling and downwelling atmospheric radiances required in the radiative transfer equation. Two different techniques are introduced for the estimation of pixel-by-pixel atmospheric parameters, focusing on the correction of Landsat Thermal Infrared (TIR) data. First technique is based on the linearization of the atmospheric parameters with the total column water vapor (W), extracted from the MOD05 product, whereas a second technique uses the Single Band Atmospheric Correction (SBAC) tool. Ground-measured values of LST in an agricultural area in central Spain, covering a variety of surface conditions, were used for a local assessment. Very similar estimation errors <2 K were obtained using both, linearization with W and SBAC techniques applied to a set of 12 Landsat 7 images. W values ranged 0.6-4 cm in this work. Wetter conditions might deteriorate the performance of the linearization technique. A preliminary analysis of the operational spatialization of this pixel-by-pixel atmospheric correction is also included.

AB  - Accurate co-registration of SAR image is a crucial step in interferometry SAR (InSAR) processing, and lower registration accuracy will lead to more interferometry phase error. The most commonly used is 2-D polynomial function registration method (2-DR), which is simple and works well in most conditions. But in the case of long baselines and complex terrain scene, (2-DR) can not meet the precision requirements. The DEM-assisted geometrical SAR image registration method (GeoR), which use the external DEM and orbit data to calculate offsets, can theoretically achieve an ideal precision for any baseline and terrain. In GeoR, corresponding elevation value of each pixel in the master image needs to extracted from the external DEM. Unfortunately, there are errors in the DEM data and the orbit data, which often result in approximate horizontal shift error and mismatch between DEM and SAR image, caused low precision elevation value extraction and eventually degrade the registration performance. In this paper, the influences of DEM error and orbital error in elevation value extraction are firstly analyzed, and then an improved geometrical SAR image registration method based on elevation correction (I-GeoR) is proposed. In elevation correction, Elevation value in DEM can be correctly assigned to each pixel of the image, which is achieved by deformation extraction that based on SAR image simulation. Finally, two ALOS-PALSAR images are processed to vaidate the new method. The result shows that I-GeoR can effectively correct the elevation and has a higher registration precision.

AB  - .stimation of crop canopy parameters is important task for remote sensing monitoring of agriculture and constructing strategies for within-field management. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the retrieval from Sentinel-2 images by parametric and non-parametric statistical models several crop canopy parameters for monitoring before winter and after winter rapeseed crop in real farming conditions of North East Bulgaria. For the calibration of the models in-situ data from three field campaigns is used. For most of the studied parameters models with good accuracy were identified, except for aboveground fresh biomass. The best identified model for vegetation fraction (RMSEcv = 0.14 %) and plant density (RMSEcv = 9 nb/m(2)) were parametric models with three band vegetation index (3BSI-Tian) and linear fitting function for the first, three band vegetation index (3BSI-Verreslt) and polynomial for the second parameter. For aboveground dry biomass (RMSEcv = 52 g/m(2)), mean plant height (RMSEcv = 4 cm) and nitrogen content in fresh biomass (RMSEcv = 2 g/kg) the best models were non-parametric, Gaussian Processes Regression for the first parameter and Variational Heteroscedastic variant of the Gaussian Processes Regression for the other two.

AB  - Accurately monitoring agriculture with satellite data is in constant demand. However, correctly relating the satellite data to ground data is not a trivial task. This study explores the possibility to use RGB digital images as ground truth in remote estimation of the flowering duration for the winter rapeseed crop (Brassica napus). I used a DJI Phantom 3 Advanced drone and camera. The flowering of the rapeseed crop is characterized by a very distinctive yellow color. The beginning and end of flowering is not an exact notion, but a user estimated one, based on the percentage of the flowering plants in the study area. Therefore, the aim is to pixel segment the acquired RGB digital images and identify the flowering pixels. The RGB color model is transformed into a Hue Saturation Value (HSV) color model that decouples the intensity information from the color information in the image. This transformation is used to improve the image classification in variable lighting conditions. Unsupervised image classification on the color transformed images gives satisfactory results in identifying the flowering pixels in the image in full and end flowering, if the images are taken under cloudless sky. The estimation of the results is done by visual user check. The experiment started after the beginning of flowering therefore this part will be performed and evaluated during the next flowering period.

AB  - Compression of an image forms the indivisible part of the digital image storage and transmission. The limitation of storage and bandwidth capacity brings the necessity for image compression. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is the technique used here for converting spatial components into frequency component. An algorithm is developed to compute DCT that yields compression of image. Compressed image is decompressed using Inverse Discrete Cosine Transformed (IDCT) to obtain a reconstructed image. The compression ratio (CR), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) are computed for three images which gives the performance criteria for DCT image compression technique. The rural image and urban image obtained by Indian Remote Sensing Satellite IRS 2 are used for deriving compression ratios. Lena image gives higher compression ratio compared to satellite rural and urban images. It is found that the rural image shows better compression ratio compared to urban image. It is seen that satellite rural image shows higher compression ratio of 7.8952 when compared to satellite urban image of 5.4244.

AB  - Nature, extent, and reliability of spatial data on land resources become the imperative need of the present day for scientific utilization of land resources and sustainable management. In land resource inventory and mapping, the applications of remotely sensed data and geographic information system (GIS) are found to be not only timesaving but also economic in generation of base maps and conducting of soil survey. Further, high-resolution remote sensing and applications of GIS have made the task of land resource inventory and mapping cost effective and time efficient. Depending upon the objective, method and intensity of land resource surveys and scale, the type of satellite data to be selected to generate the base maps in order to show the details of survey information. A detailed soil survey provides sufficient information about various kinds of soils, including problematic or degraded soils, and is immensely useful for resource appraisal and development of alternative strategies for land use and site-specific agricultural development. As a case study, a detailed land resource survey was conducted in Piprakothi Block under Purba Champaran district of Bihar, and it shows that soils are very deep, well to somewhat poorly drained, and highly calcareous. Soils suffer from waterlogging, frequent flooding, drainage congestion, calcareousness, salinity, and multi-nutrient deficiency, affecting the crop yield. Soil-site suitability evaluation of sugarcane in the soils of the block indicates that 31.7% of the area is moderately suitable for the cultivation of sugarcane due to moderate limitation of soil fertility and 53.0% of the area is marginally suitable due to relatively low water availability and severe soil fertility limitations.

AB  - Land degradation is a serious environmental issue in the world. Both space and ground-based observations could be used to define the land changes and develop the assessment of land degradation. This study assessed land degradation in the Orkhon sub-province, the best representation sample in the prominent agricultural zone of Mongolia, using Landsat Thermal Mapper (TM) and Landsat Operation Land Imager (OLI) satellite images during the periods of 1990, 1994, 2000, 2006, 2010, and 2015. The land degradation of a region could be detected by changes in spectral indices and correlation of these indices. The most frequently used spectral indices include Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). These indices were selected as indicators for representing land surface conditions vegetation biomass, landscape pattern, micrometeorology and human activities. The land degradation analysis was described by descriptive statistics, correlation distributions and correlation coefficients of changes in index outputs. In addition, the validations of these indices were also verified by comparing LST and NDWI index values with in-situ, real-time climate data from 1984 to 2010. The Land Degradation Risk Mapping (LDRM) analysis shows that the agricultural and urban areas experienced degradation due to human activities and this has led to decline in the soil moisture in this region.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a predictive model that hospitals or healthcare systems can use to identify patients at high risk of revisiting the emergency department (ED) within 30 days and thus reduce unnecessary ED use through proactive interventions.STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of fiscal years (FYs) 2013 and 2014 data from 4 Veterans Affairs hospitals in upstate New York.METHODS: This study developed a predictive model based on administrative data, a publicly available patient classification system, and logistic regression. The study data were from 4 Veterans Affairs hospitals in upstate New York; FY 2013 data were used to predict 30-day revisits in FY 2014. All 22,734 patients with ED visits were included in the analysis. The predictive variables were patient demographics, prior-year utilization, and comorbidities. To prevent overfitting, we validated the model by the split-sample method. The predictive power of the model is measured by C statistics.RESULTS: In the first model using only patient demographics, the C statistics were 0.568 (95% CI, 0.555-0.580) and 0.556 (95% CI, 0.543-0.568) for the development and validation samples, respectively. In the second model with prior-year utilization added, the C statistics were 0.748 (95% CI, 0.737-0.759) for both samples. In the final model with comorbidities added, the C statistics reached 0.773 (95% CI, 0.762-0.784) and 0.763 (95% CI, 0.753-0.774) for the development and validation samples, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The predictive model we developed in this study is straightforward to implement and offers significantly higher predictive power than other models reported in the literature. Hospitals and healthcare systems can use it to identify high-risk "frequent flyers" for early interventions to reduce ED revisits.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) are the phenomenon of urban regions usually being warmer than rural regions, which significantly impacts both the regional ecosystem and societal activities. Numerical simulation can provide spatially and temporally continuous datasets for UHI analysis. In this study, a spatially and temporally continuous ground temperature dataset of Xi'an, China was obtained through numerical simulation based on the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5), at a temporal resolution of 30 min and a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees.. Based on the ground temperature, the seasonal average UHI intensity (UHII) was calculated and the seasonal variation of the UHI effect was analyzed. The monthly variation tendency of the urban heat stress was also investigated. Based on the diurnal cycle of ground temperature and the UHI effect in each season, the variation tendencies of the maximum, minimum, and average UHII were analyzed. The results show that the urban heat stress in summer is the strongest among all four seasons. The heat stress in urban areas is very significant in July, and the UHII is the weakest in January. Regarding the diurnal cycle of UHII, the maximum always appears at 06: 30 UTC to 07: 30 UTC, while the minimum intensity of the UHI effect occurs at different times in the different seasons. The results of this study could provide a reference for policymakers about how to reduce the damage caused by heat stress.

AB  - This paper presents the methodology for irrigation mapping using the Sentinel-1 SAR data. The study is performed using VV polarization over an agricultural site in Urgell, Catalunya (Spain). From the time series for each field, the indices including the mean value and variance of the signal, the correlation length, the fractal dimension which are derived from the backscatter time series are analyzed. The classification of irrigated and nonirrigated fields is done with the indices vector formed by the parameters analyzed. The result is compared with the supervised classification from Sentinel-2 multi-band data. The accuracy is 77%. The methodology uses only SAR data, which makes it usable for all areas even with cloud cover most times of the year.

AB  - Dam construction is one of the solutions to the problem in water resources distribution and utilization caused by global climate change and the calculation of water energy reserves can provide scientific decision for it. The emergence of remotely sensed data and the application of Geographic Information System (GIS) make water reserves calculation a reality on a large scale. Hydro30 and measured runoff data are adopted to extract indicators of water energy reserves and the analysis of its spatial distribution is carried out in Anabar basin, Russia. The result shows that the most suitable site for waterpower development is concentrated in the upper reaches and the reserves of main rivers are larger than that in the source and tributary rivers.

AB  - The change of water resources under global warming is one of the most important issues faced by national economy and social development. Accurate estimation and analysis of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) are important for understanding global and regional water cycle process. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data is used to inverse water storage change in China and the correlation between it and precipitation from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is also analyzed. The study shows that GRACE TWSA and TRMM precipitation are consistent and linear. In the best regression model, R-2 and RMSE are 0.8025 and 11.1469 respectively, which suggests that precipitation is the source of water supply and also the main impact of water storage change.

AB  - The deposition of atmospheric particles on the insulator is one of the important causes for the pollution flashover events in the power grid. The distribution characteristics of atmospheric aerosol particle and its relationship with the flashover in the Eastern China are analyzed in this work. Firstly, the temporal and horizontal distributions of aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (AE), fraction of fine-mode aerosol (FMF) and particle columnar mass concentration (CMC) are analyzed during 2003 to 2013 over Eastern China using MODIS Level 3 aerosol products. The distribution of AODs have a latitudinal distinction in this region, AOD is higher in the northern part (30 degrees N north) than the southern part. The annual means of AOD are about 0.6 similar to 0.7 in the northern part and lower than 0.5 in the southern, respectively. The mean AODs of spring and summer are higher than those of autumn and winter, with the highest one in summer. It shows a fluctuant increasing trend of AOD in this region, which increases faster in the northern part than the southern. The AE has no significant variation in the research years. It presents a distribution of high in the southern part and low in the northern. It shows a seasonal feature of high in spring and winter and low in summer and autumn. The FMF of spring and winter is lower than that of summer and autumn. It shows lower FMFs in the northern part than the southern, while the growth rate of the northern is faster than the southern. To the CMC of aerosol, it shows higher value in the northern part, with the highest values in the region of Jiangsu and Shanghai and the lowest in Zhejiang. The highest CMC is in spring, while the lowest in autumn. It shows an increasing trend of CMC in the northern part, while decreasing in the southern.

AB  - Eastern China, as one of the most polluted and populated regions, plays an important role in the economic development of China. The rapid economic growth in this region has boomed China's economy for the past few years. However, due to the industrialization and urbanization in this area, more and more pollutants have been emitted into the atmosphere, which inevitably brings serious problems of air pollution. In this study, the meteorological and environmental conditions for pollution flashover events in Eastern China are analyzed from MERRA-2 (second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications) meteorological (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction and pressure) and aerosol (aerosol optical depth and particle mass concentration) products, combined with flashover frequency measurements in recent 40 years. It shows that AOD (aerosol optical depth) is higher in the northern part of Eastern China than the southern part, which is similar to the spatial distribution of occurrence rate of pollution flashover in this region. The occurrence rate of pollution flashover is higher in winter than the other seasons, especially for large-area flashover. The less precipitation, lower boundary layer height and higher particle mass concentration near surface contribute a lot to the higher flashover events in winter. For the temporal variation, it shows a relative higher occurrence rate of flashover in 1990s, which corresponding to the rapid increasing period of aerosol optical depth. The blooming up of industrial manufacture and the southward moving of industrial center in this period due to the reform and opening-up policy made more particle pollutants emitted to the air in the Eastern China. The higher loading of aerosol and more dense power grid resulted in more frequent occurrence of flashover events in Eastern China in this period. With the more advance technology of insulator and stricter environment protection policy, the occurrence of flashover events decreases in recent few years. In general, the long-term high loading of aerosols, less precipitation, more occurrences of fog and haze events and high relative humidity are the main causes for the occurrence of pollution flashover in the power grid.

TI  - Mapping growing stock volume and biomass carbon storage of larch plantations in Northeast China with L-band ALOS PALSAR backscatter mosaics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable spatial information on growing stock volume (GSV) and biomass is critical for creating management strategies for plantation forests. This study developed empirical models to map the GSV and biomass of larch plantations (LPs) in Northeast China (1.25 million km(2) total area) by integrating L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with ground-based survey data. The best correlation model was used to map the GSVs and biomasses of LPs. The total GSV and biomass carbon storage were estimated at 224.3 +/- 59.0 million m(3) and 113.0 +/- 29.7 x 10(12) g C with average densities of 85.1 m(3) ha(-1) and 42.9 10(6) g x C ha(-1), respectively, over a total area of 2.64 million ha. The saturation effect of SAR was determined beyond 260 m(3) ha(-1), which was expected to influence the estimations for a small proportion of the study area. The accuracy of the estimations has limitations mainly due to the uncertainties in the GSV inventories, discrimination of natural larch and the SAR dataset. Based on the mapping results of the GSVs of LPs, a planning strategy for multipurpose management was tentatively proposed. This study can inform policies and management practices to assure broader and sustainable benefits from plantation forests in the future.

AB  - Optimizing harvesting schedules requires a method for maturity date prediction, to avoid the influence of adverse weather and prevent the decline of crop yield or quality due to inappropriate harvest schedule. However, most prediction models are statistical-based thus are not suitable for regional application, and remote sensing-based models lacked predictability. We presented a framework that assimilated leaf area index (LAI) derived from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) into WOrld FOod Studies (WOFOST) crop growth model, and forecast meteorological data from THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) was used as weather data input for the future periods. We selected the winter wheat planting area in Henan Province as study area and recalibrated WOFOST model based on observation data from agrometeorological sites. A cost function based on normalization was constructed to quantify the difference between simulated LAI and MODIS LAI products. First the MODIS LAI profile was smoothed by Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filter, and then these two LAI profiles were normalized to keep their trend information. Then we selected parameters in WOFOST model that are sensitive to maturity date as optimization parameters, such as emergence date (IDEM), effective temperature sum from emergence to anthesis (TSUM1) and effective temperature sum from anthesis to maturity (TSUM2). These parameters have significant differences between years and no obvious spatial and temporal patterns. By means of Shuffled Complex Evolution method developed at the University of Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm, we simulated in each pixel in the study area and retrieved the optimal parameters set of this pixel. Then we run WOFOST by this optimal parameter set to simulate the growth and development of winter wheat. Moreover, we transformed TIGGE data into the CABO-format weather file to drive WOFOST simulating winter wheat growth in the next 16 d and obtained a spatial distribution of winter wheat maturity date in the study area. Comparing the forecasting date with the observed date from agrometeorological sites, it demonstrated that this method had substantial accuracy in predicting regional maturity date with correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.90 and the root mean square error (RMSE) was 1.93 d. Besides that, the distribution map of maturity prediction showed obvious spatial variability. This method can remedy the shortages of poor predictability and lacking regional differences in most previous methods, and it provides a reference for the future study of crop maturity prediction at a regional scale with longer forecast period.

TI  - Assessing forest cover change in Mexico from annual MODIS VCF data (2000-2010)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We applied annual Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) data for the detection of forest cover change (FCC) in Mexico over the period 2000-2010. We excluded the pixels with uncertain information and applied a moving average and low-pass filter to smooth the multi-temporal data to reduce the fluctuations in the forest cover for each pixel. We applied a linear regression model and created two scenarios based on the coefficient of determination and slope to determine whether a pixel had changed its land cover over the study period. This model was able to label detected changes as deforestation, degradation, reforestation, and regrowth, based on the initial and final values of forest cover. The results showed that there has been more forest gain (reforestation and regrowth) than forest loss (deforestation and degradation) during the study period. We verified these results by comparing with the biomass data derived from the Mexican National Forest and Soil Inventory (Inventario Nacional Forestal y de Suelos, abbreviated to INFyS). Our model provides an efficientmethod to assess FCC at national level, which can contribute to the development of a reference level of greenhouse gas emission as necessary for the implementation of the international policy for reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+).

TI  - Wetland Change Detection Using Cross-Fused-Based and Normalized Difference Index Analysis on Multitemporal Landsat 8 OLI
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are one of the most important ecosystems on the Earth and play a critical role in regulating regional climate, preventing floods, and reducing flood severity. However, it is difficult to detect wetland changes in multitemporal Landsat 8 OLI satellite images due to the mixed composition of vegetation, soil, and water. The main objective of this study is to quantify change to wetland cover by an image-to-image comparison change detection method based on the image fusion of multitemporal images. Spectral distortion is regarded as candidate change information, which is generated by the spectral and spatial differences between multitemporal images during the process of image cross-fusion. Meanwhile, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) were extracted from the cross-fused image as a normalized index image to enhance and increase the information about vegetation and water. Then, the modified iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) is applied to the generally fused images and normalized difference index images, providing a good evaluation of spectral distortion. The experimental results show that the proposed method performed better to reduce the detection errors due to the complicated areas under different ground types, especially in cultivated areas and forests. Moreover, the proposed method was tested and quantitatively assessed and achieved an overall accuracy of 96.67% and 93.06% for the interannual and seasonal datasets, respectively. Our method can be a tool to monitor changes in wetlands and provide effective technical support for wetland conservation.

AB  - The effect of cloud cover on the quality of remote sensing data becomes an unavoidable problem when dealing with a large amount of remote sensing data obtained from satellite sensors. As an important meteorological element, cloud plays a vital role in all areas of atmospheric science. In this paper, we propose a cloud detection method based on multi-feature hierarchical judgement. First, the gray histogram of the object to be interpreted is extracted and the histogram is intercepted to remove the singular value. Then, five types of feature are employed in feature extraction. After that, the objects to be interpreted is divided into single type and mixed type, and mixed type can be further divided into certain mixed type and uncertain type. Finally, threshold method and support vector machine(SVM) are employed to classify these types. Experiment has shown good performance of the proposed method.

AB  - The RTM-based algorithm developed to remove thin-cloud effects for Landsat-8 visible bands was extended to those of Sentine-2A visible bands. In the assessment of the extendibility, a cloud-covered Sentinel-2A image acquired on 18 February 2017 was downloaded. Another cloud-free Sentinel-2A image of the same area acquired on 8 February 2017 was selected as reference image. The three assumptions made in the original RTM-based algorithm were evaluated, and were valid for Sentinel-2A data. The algorithm was qualitatively and quantitatively effective in the thin-cloud removal for Sentinel-2A data of visible bands. Therefore, the algorithm developed for Landsat sensors was directly applicable to Sentinel-2 spectral data.

T2  - CUADERNOS GEOGRAFICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to integrate different sources of spatial information (cadastres, orthophotographies and satellite images), which also require different treatments, in order to be able to measure and evaluate the sealing of soils in a recent urban development project in the southeast of the city of Madrid, in order to establish a methodology of space-time monitoring of this parameter. Another objective is to show if the current urbanization process respects the European environmental guidelines in which waterproofed or sealed soil, inherent in economic development, coexists with natural spaces that allow to maintain some ecological functions such as softening the urban microclimate, setting growth levels of CO2 in stable figures in line with European environmental quality and standards, damping floods and preserving biodiversity.The sealing values of soils measured from different sources and using complementary techniques generate similar results when the waterproofing is higher than 60%. However, the calculations obtained from satellite images vary according to their spatial resolution and the type of treatment applied. With the Spot satellite the sealing values are close to 24%, while with the Sentinel-2 the percentage rises to 30%. Orthophotographies offer greater spatial precision, so sealing levels (<20%, 20-40%, 40-60% and >60%) have been established, but their low temporal resolution prevents continuous monitoring, at least annually. Therefore, it is necessary to use different cartographic sources when carry out a study of urban areas, since the different temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions allow to visualize different characteristics in each of them. Consequently, their complementarity helps to correct the possible inadequacies of each of them.
