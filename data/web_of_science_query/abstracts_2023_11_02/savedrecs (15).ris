TI  - Kinematic Analysis of Small and Slow-Moving Landslides Using Pleiades-1 Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although they may have small velocity values, small slope failures can cause damage to facilities such as roads and pipelines. The main goals of this paper are to detect and map, and quantify the kinematics of small and slow-moving landslides in Kutlugun, Northeastern Turkey. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) and rule-based classification techniques were utilized to detect and map the small and slow-moving landslides. The horizontal displacement of the landslides was investigated using the sub-pixel image correlation method, Cosi-Corr software, and Pleiades-1 images. Kalman filtering method and Real-Time Kinematics-Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) observations were utilized to formulate a kinematic analysis model for the landslides. A total of 123 small landslides covering an area of approximately 413.332 m(2) were detected in the study area. The displacements determined by image correlation compare very well with the RTK-GPS measurements, with a maximum deviation of 0.86 mm. The movement rate of the small landslide from RTK-GPS results ranged from 0.80- 8.28 mm during the six-month monitoring period. The average displacement value for all the monitoring points is 9.88 mm, while the average movement rate is 3.11 mm during the monitoring period. Compared to the deformation obtained using only the RTK-GPS measurements, the optical image correlation produced a more coherent deformation pattern and more detailed information on the extent and distribution of deformation. The results of the kinematic analysis suggest that the entire body of the small landslide moved slowly during the monitoring period.

TI  - Large-Scale Oceanic Dynamic Field Visualization Based on WebGL
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic visualization of ocean dynamics data is essential for effectively presenting oceanic information data. However, with the increasing spatial resolution of ocean remote sensing data, performing global-scale visualization in a single pass has become challenging. Directly rendering ocean data with high spatial resolution can result in problems such as increased communication time, blocked resource loading, and page lag. To address this issue, this paper proposes a common ocean data standard based on the characteristics of massive ocean element data, constructs an efficient three-level LOD model for ocean dynamic field rendering, and achieves particle rendering of ocean dynamic data by converting ocean data into image slices to complete the rendering of high-volume ocean data on the Web side. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed method significantly improves rendering performance. The average window construction time (FT) is reduced to 51.77ms, enhancing the overall rendering speed by approximately 64%. Meanwhile, the average frames per second (FPS) increase to 57.45fps, augmenting rendering stability and smoothness by around 18%. The peak memory consumption of the highest resolution data used in this paper is about 90MB, which is only 1/4 of the original. The proposed method effectively compensates for the disadvantage of slow rendering of large-scale ocean data visualization in some systems, enabling fast rendering of dynamic ocean data on the Web.

TI  - Multitask GANs for Oil Spill Classification and Semantic Segmentation Based on SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasingly frequent marine oil spill disasters have great harm to the marine ecosystem. As an essential means of remote sensing monitoring, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images can detect oil spills in time and reduce marine pollution. Many look-alike oil spill regions are difficult to distinguish in SAR images, and the scarcity of real oil spill data makes it difficult for deep learning networks to train effectively. In order to solve the abovementioned problems, this article designs a multitask generative adversarial networks (MTGANs) oil spill detection model to distinguish oil spills and look-alike oil spills and segment oil spill areas in one framework. The discriminator of the first generative adversarial network (GAN) is transformed into a classifier, which can effectively distinguish between real and look-alike oil spills. The generator of the secondGANmodel integrates a fully convolutional symmetric structure and multiple convolution blocks. Multiple convolution blocks can extract the shallow oil spill information, and the fully convolutional symmetric structure can extract the deeper features of the oil spill information. The algorithm only needs to use a small number of oil spill images as the training set to train the network, and the limitation of the oil spill dataset can be solved. Validation evaluations are conducted on three datasets of Sentinel-1, ERS-1/2, and GF-3 satellites, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MTGANs oil spill detection framework outperforms other models in oil spill classification and semantic segmentation. Among them, the classification accuracy of the oil spill and look-alikes can reach 97.22%. The average OA for semantic segmentation of the oil spill area can be 97.47% and the average precision can reach 86.69%.

TI  - Multifeature Semantic Complementation Network for Marine Oil Spill Localization and Segmentation Based on SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine oil spill causes severe damage to the marine ecological environment. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is widely used in marine oil spill detection due to its all-day and all-weather advantages. However, long stripe shape oil spill areas make it challenging to extract the oil spills effectively. A multifeature semantic complementation network (MFSCNet) is proposed for oil spill localization and segmentation of SAR images in one framework to address these problems. The long strip shape interference of oil spill is reduced by extracting intensity and damping ratio characters from nonpolarimetric features and entropy, anisotropy, and mean scattering angle from polarization features to form a multifeature SAR image. Then, the backbone feature network and feature fusion module are used for feature extraction. The decoupled head and the proposed oil spill semantic segmentation head are used for localization and semantic segmentation tasks, respectively. Also, the semantic complementation module is used in the training phase. It combines the results of localization and semantic segmentation to obtain complementation boxes for interactive iterative updating of the model parameters to enhance the detection accuracy of localization boxes. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated based on a lot of Sentinel-1 oil spill data compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - On the Use of Dual Co-Polarized Radar Data to Derive a Sea Surface Doppler ModeluPart 2: Simulation and Validation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Doppler shift obtained from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements comprises the combined contribution to the radial motion of the ocean surface induced by the sea state (wind waves and swell) and underlying surface currents. Hence, to obtain reliable estimates of the ocean surface current (OCS), the sea-state-induced Doppler shifts must be accurately estimated and eliminated. In this study, we use a semiempirical dual co-polarization Doppler velocity (DPDop) model, presented in the companion paper, to calculate sea-state-induced Doppler shifts using buoy-measured wind speed, wind direction, and ocean wave spectra. The DPDop model-simulated Doppler shifts are compared with the collocated Sentinel-1B SAR Wave (WV) mode observations at the 24. and 37. incidence angles, showing a bias of -0.24 Hz and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5.55 Hz. This evaluation is also implemented on a simplified DPDop model at the same incidence angles. The model inputs include wind fields from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and wave characteristic parameters (e.g., significant wave height (SWH), mean wave direction, and mean wavenumber) from WAVEWATCH III (WW3). The estimated Doppler shifts are validated using the ascending and descending observations of Sentinel-1B WV over the global ocean. Furthermore, the comparisons show that the bias and RMSE are -0.71 and 9.25 Hz, respectively. Based on accurate wave bias correction, we obtain the radial current speeds of the ocean surface from the Doppler shift measurements. The estimated current speeds are compared with the collocated high-frequency (HF) radar measurements, with a bias of -0.04 m/s and an RMSE of 0.15 m/s. These results suggest that the original and simplified DPDop models can be used to estimate sea-state-induced Doppler shifts and, thus, derive accurate surface current retrievals.

TI  - Establishment of a Monitoring Model for the Cotton Leaf Area Index Based on the Canopy Reflectance Spectrum
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotton is the main economic crop in China and is important owing to its use as an industrial raw material and a cash crop. This experiment was conducted in the main cotton-producing area of Xinjiang, China. A hyperspectrometer was used to monitor the canopy spectral reflectance of cotton at different stages of growth. The results showed that the leaf area index (LAI) increased with the increase in the amount of nitrogen fertilizer added during the early full boll stage and decreased with the increase in nitrogen fertilization in the full and late boll stages. Insufficient or excessive fertilization led to a decrease in the LAI. The visible light band indicated that the canopy spectral reflectance decreased, and the amount of fertilizer increased in all the growth stages. The near-infrared band revealed that the canopy spectral reflectance increased with the amount of nitrogen applied during the bud stage, early boll stage, and the most vigorous period of boll growth. During the flowering period, the spectral reflectance followed the order N3 > N4 > N2 > N1 > N0. During the entire growth period of cotton, the values of the cotton LAI predicted using the ratio vegetation index (RVI) model were found to best fit the measured values. The LAI monitoring models of cotton in each growth stage were different. The TVI model is the best in the bud and early boll stages. The NDVI model is the best in the flowering stage, and the DVI model is the best in the full boll stage. This study provides a basis to accurately monitor the LAI in each growth period of cotton.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Composite regularization models are widely used in sparse signal processing, making multiple regularization parameters selection a significant problem to be solved. Variety kinds of composite regularization models are used in sparse microwave imaging, including L-1 and L-2 penalty, nonconvex and total variation penalty, combined dictionary, etc. In this article, a new adaptive multiple regularization parameters selection method named L-hypersurface is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments. Simulation experiments indicate that the selected optimal regularization parameters have satisfied reconstruction results, both visually and numerically. Furthermore, experiments on Gaofen-3 synthetic aperture radar satellite data are also exploited to show the performance of the proposed method.

TI  - Aerosol Retrieval Study from a Particulate Observing Scanning Polarimeter Onboard Gao-Fen 5B without Prior Surface Knowledge, Based on the Optimal Estimation Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To meet the demand for the aerosol detection of single-angle and multi-band polarization instrument containing short-wave infrared bands, an inversion algorithm that makes full use of multi-band intensity and polarization information is proposed based on optimal estimation theory. This method uses the polarization information in the short-wave infrared band to perform surface and atmosphere decoupling without a prior information on the surface. This obtains the initial value of the aerosol, and then it uses the scalar information to obtain the final result. Moreover, the multi-band information of the instrument is used for decoupling the surface and atmospheric information, which avoids the inversion error caused by the untimely update of the surface reflectance database and the error of spatio-temporal matching. The measured data of the Particulate Observing Scanning Polarimeter (POSP) are used to test the proposed algorithm. Firstly, to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm under different surface conditions, four regions with large geographical differences (Beijing, Hefei, Baotou, and Taiwan) are selected for aerosol optical depth (AOD) inversion, and they are compared with the aerosol robotic network (AERONET) products of the nearby stations. The validation against the AERONET products produces high correlation coefficients of 0.982, 0.986, 0.718, and 0.989, respectively, which verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm in different regions. Further, we analyzed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under different pollution conditions. Regions with AOD >0.7 and AOD < 0.7 are screened by using the AOD products of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiomete (MODIS), and the AOD of the corresponding region is inverted using POSP data. It was found to be spatially consistent with the MODIS products. The correlation coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE) in the AOD high region were 0.802 and 0.217, respectively, and 0.944 and 0.022 in the AOD low region, respectively, which verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under different pollution conditions.

TI  - Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval Based on Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) and a Combine Algorithm of Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm and Simplified and Robust Surface Reflectance Estimation (SREMARA)
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol satellite retrieval can provide detailed aerosol information on a large scale, which becomes one of the main ways of global aerosol research. However, rapid and accrue aerosol retrieval by satellite is challenging, typically requiring radiation transfer models (RTMs) and surface reflectance (SR). An aerosol retrieval algorithm (SEMARA) combining the simplified aerosol retrieval algorithm and simplified and robust surface reflectance estimation can obtain local high-precision aerosol optical depth (AOD) without RTMs and SR datasets, while the method cannot perform large-scale and long-term aerosol retrieval. Hereby, a machine learning (ML) method based on the fully connected neural network (FCNN) and SEMARA was proposed. The new method optimizes the traditional sample construction of the ML and can achieve aerosol retrieval at a larger spatial and temporal scale. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data were applied to AOD retrieval on four typical regions globally. The AOD retrievals were validated using aerosol robotic network measurements in comparison to MOD04_3K AOD and the SEMARA. The accuracy validation indicators of the new method, in which the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.109, mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.072, Pearson correlation coefficient (R) was 0.8983, and approximately 79.69% of the retrievals fell within the expected error (EE), performed better than MOD04_3K (RMSE = 0.1972 MAE = 0.1403, R = 0.7692 and Within EE = 55.24%) and the SEMARA method (RMSE = 0.2465 MAE = 0.1106, R = 0.0.5968 and Within EE = 72.85%) in all study regions, and the AOD retrievals can better reflect the spatial variation of AOD with better spatial continuity and coverage.

TI  - A Normalized Spectral Angle Index for Estimating the Probability of Viewing Sunlit Leaves From Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The probability of viewing sunlit leaves (PT) is a crucial variable influencing observed canopy spectra. Proper determination of PT is necessary for the quantitative retrieval of vegetation parameters using remote sensing. This article describes a spectral index for estimating PT from satellite-observed canopy spectra. For this purpose, we propose a normalized spectral angle index (NSAI) at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, based on the spectral shapes of leaf and soil background. The performance of NSAI in estimating PT was evaluated using one ground-based high-resolution imaging dataset, one synthetic satellite dataset, and one satellite-ground synchronous observation dataset. The results demonstrate that NSAI is more suitable for estimating PT from satellite data than five commonly used spectral indices, including enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference spectral index (NDSI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), simple ratio (SR) index, and photochemical reflectance index (PRI). NSAI exhibits a significant linear correlation with PT. The empirical model for estimating PT based on NSAI has the best transferability from simulated to in situ satellite data. For the fine spectral-spatial resolution (Hyperion) data, the normalized root-mean-square error (nRMSE) and adjusted R-2 of estimated PT were 14.9% and 0.744, respectively. For MODIS images, PT was estimated with satisfactory accuracy, with an nRMSE of 18.71% and an adjusted R-2 of 0.670. NSAI is potentially applicable to satellite images for direct estimation of PT to improve the inversion accuracy of vegetation parameters.

TI  - Rapid Identification of Main Vegetation Types in the Lingkong Mountain Nature Reserve Based on Multi-Temporal Modified Vegetation Indices
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nature reserves are among the most bio-diverse regions worldwide, and rapid and accurate identification is a requisite for their management. Based on the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 dataset, this study presents three multi-temporal modified vegetation indices (the multi-temporal modified normalized difference Quercus wutaishanica index (MTM-NDQI), the multi-temporal modified difference scrub grass index (MTM-DSI), and the multi-temporal modified ratio shaw index (MTM-RSI)) to improve the classification accuracy of the remote sensing of vegetation in the Lingkong Mountain Nature Reserve of China (LMNR). These three indices integrate the advantages of both the typical vegetation indices and the multi-temporal remote sensing data. By using the proposed indices with a uni-temporal modified vegetation index (the uni-temporal modified difference pine-oak mixed forest index (UTM-DMI)) and typical vegetation indices (e.g., the ratio vegetation index (RVI), the difference vegetation index (DVI), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), an optimal feature set is obtained that includes the NDVI of December, the NDVI of April, and the UTM-DMI, MTM-NDQI, MTM-DSI, and MTM-RSI. The overall accuracy (OA) of the random forest classification (98.41%) and Kappa coefficient of the optimal feature set (0.98) were higher than those of the time series NDVI (OA = 96.03%, Kappa = 0.95), the time series RVI (OA = 95.56%, Kappa = 0.95), and the time series DVI (OA = 91.27%, Kappa = 0.90). The OAs of the rapid classification and the Kappa coefficient of the knowledge decision tree based on the optimal feature set were 95.56% and 0.95, respectively. Meanwhile, only three of the seven vegetation types were omitted or misclassified slightly. Overall, the proposed vegetation indices have advantages in identifying the vegetation types in protected areas.

TI  - SDRCNN: A Single-Scale Dense Residual Connected Convolutional Neural Network for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is a process of fusing a high spatial resolution panchromatic image and a low spatial resolution multispectral (MS) image to create a high-resolution MS image. A novel single-branch, single-scale lightweight convolutional neural network, named SDRCNN, is developed in this article. By using a novel dense residual connected structure and convolution block, SDRCNN achieved a better tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. The performance of SDRCNN was tested using four datasets from the WorldView-3, WorldView-2, and QuickBird satellites. The compared methods include eight traditional methods (i.e., GS, Gram-Schmidt adaptive, partial replacement adaptive CS, band-related spatial detail, smoothing-filter-based intensity modulation, GLP-CBD, CDIF, and LRTCFPan) and five lightweight deep-learning methods (i.e., pansharpening neural network, PanNet, BayesianNet, DMDNet, and FusionNet). Based on a visual inspection of the pansharpened images created and the associated absolute residual maps, SDRCNN exhibited least spatial detail blurring and spectral distortion, among all the methods considered. The values of the quantitative evaluation metrics were closest to their ideal values when SDRCNN was used. The processing time of SDRCNN was also the shortest among all methods tested. Finally, the effectiveness of each component in the SDRCNN was demonstrated in ablation experiments. All of these confirmed the superiority of SDRCNN.

TI  - Estimation of the influenza-associated respiratory hospitalization burden using sentinel surveillance data, Lebanon, 2015-2020
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionInfluenza epidemics cause around 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness worldwide every year. Estimates are needed for a better understanding of the burden of disease especially in low- and middle-income countries. The objective of this study is to estimate the number and rate of influenza-associated respiratory hospitalizations in Lebanon during five influenza seasons (2015-2016 to 2019-2020) by age and province of residence in addition to estimating the influenza burden by level of severity. MethodsThe severe acute respiratory infection sentinel surveillance system was used to compute influenza positivity from the influenza laboratory confirmed cases. The total of respiratory hospitalizations under the influenza and pneumonia diagnosis was retrieved from the Ministry of Public Health hospital billing database. Age-specific and province-specific frequencies and rates were estimated for each season. Rates per 100 000 population were calculated with 95% confidence levels. ResultsThe estimated seasonal average of influenza-associated hospital admission was 2866 for a rate of 48.1 (95% CI: 46.4-49.9) per 100 000. As for the distribution by age group, the highest rates were seen in the two age groups >= 65 years and 0-4 years whereas the lowest rate was for the age group 15-49 years. For the distribution by province of residence, the highest influenza-associated hospitalization rates were reported from the Bekaa-Baalback/Hermel provinces. ConclusionThis study shows the substantial burden of influenza in Lebanon mainly on high-risk groups (>= 65 years and <5 years). It is crucial to translate these findings into policies and practices to reduce the burden and estimate the illness-related expenditure and indirect costs.

AB  - This work aims to investigate the potential of the application of Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) to bridge monitoring, in order to demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting damages early, preventing collapses and triggering in-situ inspections, especially if integrated with advanced numerical modeling. A post-processing methodology is presented, able to derive two-dimensional displacement configurations of multi-span bridges with properly defined error bounds, using both ascending and descending SAR acquisitions. The bounds are estimated by considering both random and systematic errors, accounting for the orientation of the bridge with respect to the Line-Of-Sights of the satellites, the hypothesized deformation plane and the accuracy of the measurements. The proposed procedure has been applied to the case study of the Albiano-Magra Bridge in Italy, collapsed on April 8th 2020. The results, referred to the monitoring period 2015-2020, highlight anomalies in the displacements of the first two spans and abutment of the East side, observed during the three years preceding the failure, thus providing information on the possible cause of collapse. A numerical model of the bridge, based on the Applied Element Method (AEM), was developed in order to simulate the progressive collapse of the structure subjected to the settlements derived by monitoring data and to verify the hypothesis on the kinematics and its causes.

T2  - GECONTEC-REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE GESTION DEL CONOCIMIENTO Y LA TECNOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - For thousands of years the Guna people have made use of the plant resources found in their environment for their vital needs as the production of food, medicine, firewood, construction, crafts, dyes, among others. Their worldview of nature has allowed them to have a very intimate relationship with their natural context. Despite this relationship, the traditional knowledge associated with the uses of plants is being lost over the years. For this reason, the purpose of this study is to learn about the uses of plants and thus provide valuable information on the knowledge of the use of plant diversity in the Guna communities. For this purpose, a descriptive-transversal ethnobotanical research was carried out in 9 communities of the townships of Nargana and Corazon de Jesus, through open surveys and collection of samples of plant specimens.A floristic inventory was carried out with 85 species, which resulted in the identification of 6 ethnobotanical categories, the most mentioned uses being: ecological references (70 mentions), food (46 mentions), construction (45 mentions), handicraft (38 mentions), fuel (18 mentions), medicinal (16 mentions). Use value indexes (UVI) were calculated by ethnobotanical category. The results present information on the cultural diversity and ancestral popular knowledge of the Guna people. This continues to be rooted in their identity, where the plant resource is very valuable, so this study provides information that allows for relevant decision making for the promotion of long-term conservation strategies for the forested areas of Guna Yala.

M3  - Article
AB  - The first ever comprehensive study on wildland fires in Bangladesh is carried out to develop a fire prevention and prediction method. The major causes of huge wildland fires (88%) in the subtropical Chittagong Hill forest (43% of total) of southern Bangladesh are reported as shifting cultivation, grazing and unauthorized settlement. We used satellite hotspot (HS) data from 2003 to 2021 (a total of 54,669 HSs) to clarify the spatio-temporal structure of wildland fires. Fire weather conditions were analyzed using various weather data and synoptic-scale weather maps at different air levels. Fires concentrated from March through April or a transitional period from the dry season, caused by the Asian winter monsoon, to the wet season, due to the Asian summer monsoon. Fire occurrence depended on dry conditions and pre-monsoon showers and their timing. The difference in 925 hPa heights of high and low pressure systems may be attributed to the different types of the Asian winter and summer monsoons. The average maximum air temperature and incident shortwave solar energy in April were the highest and strongest, contributing fire-prone weather conditions. Based on the analysis, a fire prevention and prediction method will be developed, and this report may also facilitate the establishment of future CO2 reduction measures for Bangladesh.

AB  - In his first novel - Almayer's Folly - Conrad describes a tragic family history that can be read as a confrontation with colonialism. In Almayer's Folly Conrad's criticism of the mentality of Europeans, and of their colonial arrogance is devastating. The narrator's sympathy lies with the 'wild' and unspoiled existence of the Malays, but since Conrad, in accordance with his skepticism, does not offer any solutions, his portrayal of the Malay world is also reserved. In Conrad's depiction of tropical nature, constituting the background of the events, this reservation increases to a hitherto to some extend underexposed metaphysical nihilism, revealing the tragic and dark worldview of Conrad.

M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of land use between 1998 and 2018 in the Sambande Community Forest, which was set aside in 1999 and has been exploited for charcoal production since 2007, was assessed using Landsat satellite images, a household survey and floristic data collected in 2019. Mapping based on Landsat images shows that spontaneous vegetation has recovered significantly. This observation is shared by the population, with the proportion of respondents considering that spontaneous vegetation was abundant increasing from 14 % for 1998 (before the protection) to 66 % for 2018. This improvement in vegetation cover was expressed by an increase in shrub and tree savannahs. Between the two dates, the former increased from 43.1% to 52.1% of the study area and the latter from 11.3 % to 15.8 %. At the same time, degraded wooded savannah decreased significantly, from 33.5 % to 14.2 % of the total area. The decrease in degraded area is here the mark of a territory in reconstitution, hence the concordance with the survey. However, the floristic inventories give a different view, as the number of individuals and floristic diversity on the plots are not linked by a simple and close relationship to the apparent degree of recovery of the vegetation cover.

TI  - Change Detection of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Through Adaptive Focal Modulation on Hierarchical Feature Maps
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major challenges in the change detection (CD) of high-resolution remote sensing images is the high requirement for computational resources. Besides, to get the best change detection result, it must spot only the important changes while omitting unimportant ones, which requires learning complex interactions between multi-scale objects on the images. Despite Convolution Neural Network (CNN) efficiently extracting features from such images, it has a limited receptive field resulting in sub-optimal representation. On the other hand, Vision Transformer (ViT) can capture long-range dependencies. Still, it suffers from quadratic complexity concerning the number of image patches, especially for high-resolution images. Furthermore, both approach can not model the interactions among multi-scale image patches, which is essential for a model to fully understand the natural images. We propose FocalCD, a CD method based on a recently proposed focal modulation architecture capable of learning short and long dependencies to solve this problem. It is attention-free and does not suffer from quadratic complexity. Also, it supports learning multi-scale interaction by adaptively selecting the discriminator regions from multi-scale levels. Besides the efficient yet powerful encoder, FocalCD has an effective multi-scale feature fusion and pyramidal decoder network. FocalCD achieves strong empirical results on various CD datasets, including CDD, LEVIR-CD, and WHU-CD. It reaches F1 scores of 0.9851, 0.952, and 0.9616 on datasets CDD, LEVIR-CD, and WHU-CD outperforming state-of-the-art CD methods while having comparable or even lower computation complexity.

M3  - Article
AB  - As the long-term sustainability of both natural and artificial phytocenoses is under serious threat from biological invaders, the global community is working hard to prevent invasions and rapidly eradicate or halt the spread of invasive species. By tracking the actual spread of "invaders" or predicting areas at risk of invasion, geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing of the Earth (RSE) can significantly assist the process of ensuring biosecurity at the state level. Research has shown the potential of remote sensing and GIS applications for invasive species mapping and modeling, even though it is currently restricted to a small number of taxa. This article gives examples of how GIS and RSE can be used to track invasive species like Utricularia australis R. br. and Lemna aequinoctialis Welw. To describe the distribution of species, current Internet databases of species distribution and the author's own research were used. It also talks about promising ways to find and track the spread of invasive species, like using NDVI indices, chlorophyll and xanthophyll content to find changes in regional biodiversity, some problems with finding changes in biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, and mapping invasion risk. The study also demonstrates how GIS technology may be used to identify agricultural landscape biodiversity using radiometric space data from Sentinel 1, followed by a verification of the findings. The prospects of spatial, spectral, and temporal analysis of images are determined, as they make it possible to outline the boundaries of ecosystems, biometric characteristics of species, characteristics of their current and potential areas of distribution, etc.

TI  - Using Experimental Models and Multitemporal Landsat-9 Images for Cadmium Concentration Mapping
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology and its integration with machine learning are the examples of effective and low-cost acquisition, particularly in the field of environmental studies and earth sciences for optimal management. The purpose of this study is to accurately map the cadmium (Cd) concentration and introduce the most suitable regression model among different models, including support vector regression (SVR), partial least square regression (PLSR), and artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this study, instead of using a single-date (SD) Landsat-9 image, multitemporal (MT) images were used, and the extraction of suitable features to estimate the Cd concentration was selected as the input of the regression model. For this purpose, 20 Landsat-9 images and 100 soil samples were prepared from the Ust-Kamenogorsk region in northeastern Kazakhstan. The comparison of MT images and SD images of Landsat-9 showed that MT images have a better performance for monitoring the concentration of heavy metals compared to SD images. Among various features investigated in this study, the original band (OB) was found to be the most appropriate feature for grouping regressions. The results suggested that SVR model with OB as the input leads to the most accurate estimate of the Cd concentration in the area, which was in the range of 8-26 mg/kg.

TI  - Fast Ocean Front Detection Using Deep Learning Edge Detection Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Small-scale ocean fronts play a significant role in absorbing the excess heat and CO2 generated by climate change, yet their dynamics are not well understood. The existing in situ and remote sensing measurements of the ocean have inadequate spatial and temporal coverage to map small-scale ocean fronts globally. In addition, conventional algorithms to generate ocean front maps are computationally intensive and require data with long lead times. We propose machine learning (ML) models to detect temperature and chlorophyll ocean fronts from unprocessed and radiometrically uncorrected satellite imagery by transfer learning from the existing models for edge detection. We use two separate datasets: one based on conventional approaches to ocean front detection, and a second based on human-annotated ground truth. The deep learning front detection approach significantly reduces the resources and overall lead times needed for detecting ocean fronts. The deep learning models are developed with resource-constrained edge compute platforms, such as CubeSats in mind, as such platforms can address the spatial and temporal coverage challenges. The highest performing models achieve the accuracies of 96% and make predictions in milliseconds using unoptimized desktop CPUs and less than 100 MB of storage; these capabilities are well suited for CubeSat deployment.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf)
CL  - San Antonio, TX
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR) enables three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of urban buildings with a high level of details. However, traditional spectrum estimation algorithms for TomoSAR inversion are usually based on large data stacks and high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. For the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) dataset with few available images, due to the low image resolution and large baseline intervals, traditional methods fail to achieve accurate 3-D reconstruction of the interested area. Compressed sensing (CS) method has super-resolution imaging capability in TomoSAR, which can significantly reduce the number of samples required for 3-D imaging. With the help of multi-signal compressed sensing (MCS) theory, this paper introduces a novel processing workflow to achieve 3-D reconstruction of Chinese GF-3 Satellite dataset. This workflow firstly uses two-dimensional (2-D) building footprint geographic information system (GIS) data to extract features of target building. Then, these features are introduced into the estimation as prior knowledge to improve the accuracy of TomoSAR inversion. Finally, to ensure that scatterers on the same contour line of a building are regularly arranged, we exploit total variation (TV) to constrain the distribution of these scatterers. This paper uses the GF-3 dataset to generate high-resolution 3-D point cloud of Beijing, demonstrating the potential of GF-3 satellite for 3-D imaging.

TI  - Super-Resolution-Aided Sea Ice Concentration Estimation From AMSR2 Images by Encoder-Decoder Networks With Atrous Convolution
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive microwave data is an important data source for the continuous monitoring of Arctic-wide sea ice concentration (SIC). However, its coarse spatial resolution leads to blurring effects at the ice-water divides, resulting in the great challenges of fine-scale and accurate SIC estimation, especially for regions with low SIC. Besides, the SIC derived by operational algorithms using high-frequency passive microwave observations has great uncertainties in open water or marginal ice zones due to atmospheric effects. In this article, a novel framework is proposed to achieve accurately SIC estimation with improved spatial details from original low-resolution Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) images, with joint the super-resolution (SR) and SIC estimation network. Based on the SR network, the spatial resolution of original AMSR2 images can be improved by four times, benefiting to construct AMSR2 SR features with more high-frequency information for SIC estimation. The SIC network with an encoder-decoder structure and atrous convolution, is employed to accurately perform the SIC retrieval by considering the characteristics of passive microwave images in the Arctic sea ice region. Experimental results show that the proposed SR-Aided SIC estimation approach can generate accurate SIC with more detailed sea ice textures and much sharper sea ice edges. With respect to MODIS SIC products distributed in Arctic scale, the proposed model achieves a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5.94% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.04%, whereas the Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI) SIC results have three and two times greater values of RMSE and MAE.

AB  - The Mw 6.6 Menyuan earthquake occurred on January 8th of 2022 on the northern margin of Menyuan Basin, Qinghai. It was followed by over 600 aftershocks with magnitudes of up to M 5.1. The mainshock was located on the Lenglongling (LLLF) segment of the Qilian-Haiyuan (QLHYF) sinistral fault system, a 127-km-long active fault with a characteristic event of Mw 7.3-7.5. In this study, we used seismic and geodetic data for the characterization of this seismic event and its large aftershocks. Using the seismic data and the CAPjoint inversion method, we obtained the centroid depths and focal mechanisms of the mainshock and the 17 largest (Ms >= 3.0) aftershocks. We determined that the mainshock was a strike-slip event with a moment magnitude of 6.58, centroid depth of 4 km, and the two nodal planes of 197 degrees/83 degrees/-162 degrees and 104 degrees/72 degrees/-7 degrees. Most of the estimated aftershocks were also strike-slip events located at depths ranging from 3-9 km at the periphery of the earthquake centroid. We analyzed the rupture directivity of the two large aftershocks (Ms 5.2 and Ms 4.8) with the azimuthal variation of source duration and found that both events ruptured 1.5-2.0 km segments along the sinistral fault plane. We also processed Sentinel-1 SAR data acquired on tracks 026, 033, and 128 using an automated InSAR processing package, pSAR. The SAR-derived results that include subpixel offsets, coherence maps, and differential interferometry consistently reveal two major surface rupture segments that correlate with a step-over of Tuolaishan fault and the western segment of LLLF, respectively. We performed a geodetic inversion of the ascending and descending coseismic InSAR observations using a geodetic inversion package PSOKINV in order to determine geometric parameters and subsurface slip on the fault. During the inversion, the surface fault traces were fixed based on the observations from the subpixel offsets and coherence maps produced from the SAR data. The geodetic inversion indicates that the sinistral strike-slips on the two steep-dipping fault segments are responsible for the mainshock, having three distinct slip patterns with a maximum slip of about 4 m at a depth of 4 km, which is consistent with the seismic solutions. The geodetic moment from the slip model was 1.58x10(19) Nm, corresponding to Mw 6.68, which is slightly greater than Mw 6.58 estimated from the seismic data. We also compared the seismic source solutions produced by the different seismic methods to the multiple earthquake fault segments inferred from the InSAR results obtained in this study. We found that the significant variations of the seismic solutions from P first motion polarizations, CAPjoint, GCMT and USGS W-phase are mainly due to the different periods of the seismic data used in the inversions. The solution derived from the P first motions is consistent with the fault F1 determined from the offset maps presented in this study that corresponds to the step-over of Tuolaishan fault. With longer periods, the seismic focal mechanism solutions turn out closer to the epicenter of the earthquake. This could help with the understanding of seismic solutions for other earthquakes, particularly those with significant strike variations along the rupture. Combining with regional tectonic structures and historical earthquakes, e.g., the 1986 and 2016 Ms 6.4 thrust-slip Menyuan earthquakes, we suggest that an asymmetrical flower structure along QLHYF may have been a key model for unleashing the regional strain.The coseismic slip-derived stress analysis indicates that the earthquake significantly increased the Coulomb stress in the vicinity of the hypocenter, particularly at the western end of the earthquake rupture, where few aftershocks were observed, drawing our attention to the increased seismic risk in that region.

TI  - Dynamic Large-Small Kernel Convolutional Neural Network for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is a spatial-spectral fusion technique that fuses low-resolution multispectral (MS) images with high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images to get high-resolution MS images which are rich in spectral and spatial information. Some pansharpening methods based on dynamic convolution were proposed to improve the adaptivity and generalization of the fusion network. However, these methods either only focus on local small regions or generate dynamic filters with a complex network. Besides, the dynamic filters in the existing methods only convolve with MS or PAN images, resulting in the extracted details or spectral features are inadequate. In this letter, we propose a dynamic large-small kernel convolutional network. To obtain small scale features, we propose a dual dynamic small kernel (DDSK) module which consists of dynamic spatial small filter (DASF) and dynamic spectral small filter (DESF). The multiscale dynamic large kernel convolution (MDLC) module is designed to expand the receptive field for obtaining large scale features. Considering the differences between PAN and MS images, DASF and spatial MDLC modules are presented to extract the details of PAN image. Similarly, DESF and spectral MDLC modules are proposed to obtain the spectral features of MS images. The proposed method is evaluated on GaoFen-2 and WorldView-3 datasets, and our method shows good performance.

TI  - Study of the geomagnetic field's regional gradients in Chinese continent using three-dimensional surface Spline model
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We combined domestic ground-based and satellite magnetic measurements to create a regional three-dimensional surface Spline (3DSS) gradient model of the main geomagnetic field over the Chinese continent. To improve the precision of the model, we considered the data gap between the ground and satellite data. We compared and analyzed the results of the Taylor polynomial, surface Spline, and CHAOS-6 (the CHAMP, Orsted and SAC-C model of Earth's magnetic field) gradient models. Results showed that the gradients in the south-north and east-west directions of the four models were consistent. The 3DSS model was able to express not only gradients at different altitudes, but also average gradients inside the research area. The two Spline models were able to capture more information on gradient anomalies than were the fitted models. Strong local anomalies were observed in northern Xinjiang, Beijing, and the junction area between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the total intensity F decreased whereas the altitude increased. The gradient decreased by 21.69% in the south-north direction and increased by 11.78% in the east-west direction. In addition, the altitude gradient turned from negative to positive while the altitude increased. The Spline model and the two fitted models differed mainly in the field sources they expressed and the modeling theory.

TI  - Success Rates of Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping for Endometrial Cancer in Patients with Body Mass Index < 45 Compared with Body Mass Index ≥ 45.
T2  - Journal of minimally invasive gynecology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The objective is to evaluate the rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in patients with body mass index (BMI [kg/m2]) BMI ≥ 45 compared with < 45.DESIGN: A retrospective chart review.SETTING: Three urban referral-based settings-1 academic and 2 community based.PATIENTS: Patients age ≥ 18 years, with endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia or clinical stage 1 endometrial cancer who underwent robot-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy with attempted SLN mapping between January 2015 and December 2021.INTERVENTIONS: Robot-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy with attempted SLN mapping.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 933 subjects were included: 795 (85.2%) with BMI < 45 and 138 (14.8%) with BMI ≥ 45. Comparing the BMI < 45 with BMI ≥ 45 group, bilateral mapping was successful in 541 (68.1%) vs 63 (45.7%), respectively. Unilateral mapping was successful in 162 (20.4%) vs 33 (23.9%), respectively. Failure to map occurred in 92 (11.6%) vs 42 (30.4%) (p <.001), respectively. Exploratory analysis also suggested an inverse relationship between success rate of bilateral SLN mapping and BMI, with patients with BMI < 20 having bilateral SLN mapping rates of 86.5% and patients with BMI ≥ 61 having rates of 20.0%. The steepest decline in bilateral SLN mapping rates was from BMI group 46 to 50 compared to 51 to 55, at 55.4% to 37.5%, respectively. Adjusted odds ratio (compared with those with BMI < 30) for those in the BMI 30 to 44 group was 0.36 (95% confidence interval 0.21-0.60) and for those in the BMI ≥ 45 group was 0.10 (95% confidence interval 0.06-0.19).CONCLUSION: There is a statistically significant lower rate of SLN mapping in patients with a BMI ≥ 45 than BMI < 45. Understanding the success of SLN mapping in patients with morbid obesity is essential for preoperative counseling, surgical planning, and developing a risk-appropriate postoperative treatment plan.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Soil Erosion Modelling Based on Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent years have seen an increase in the use of remote-sensing based methods to assess soil erosion, mainly due to the availability of freely accessible satellite data, with successful results on a consistent basis. There would be valuable benefits from applying these techniques to the Arctic areas, where ground local studies are typically difficult to perform due to hardly accessible roads and lands. At the same time, however, the application of remote-sensing methods comes with its own set of challenges when it comes to the peculiar features of the Arctic: short growing periods, winter storms, wind, and frequent cloud and snow cover. In this study we perform a comparative analysis of three commonly used classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), in combination with ground truth samples from regions all over Iceland, provided by Iceland's Soil Conservation Service department. The process can be automated to predict soil erosion risk for larger, less accessible areas from Sentinel-2 images. The analysis performed on validation data sets supports the effectiveness of both approaches for modeling soil erosion, albeit differences are highlighted.

TI  - Fusing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Images for Deforestation Detection in the Brazilian Amazon Under Diverse Cloud Conditions
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the current deforestation detection systems rely on cloud-free optical images, which are difficult to obtain in tropical regions. A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is nearly unaffected by clouds, thus providing valuable insights for deforestation detection. In cloud-free conditions, the use of optical images usually provides better results than the use of SAR data alone. Optical-SAR fusion has been hailed as a promising way to improve deforestation detection. However, it was poorly investigated, particularly when optical images are affected by clouds. This letter employs optical-SAR fusion strategies to improve the classification accuracy of clear-cut deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon under diverse cloud conditions. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images were fused using fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and early, joint, and late fusion (LF) strategies. Experiments showed that the optical-SAR fusion outperforms the single-modality (optical or SAR) variants for deforestation detection on pixels affected by clouds. The joint fusion strategy provided the best results in all cloud cover scenarios.

T2  - ALEA-ESTUDOS NEOLATINOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drawing on Linda Hutcheon's A Theory of Parody, this article considers Campos de Carvalho's A lua vem da Asia as a parody of Louis-Ferdinand Celine's Journey to the End of the Night. The article describes A lua vem da Asia as a tense bitextual synthesis that deferentially picks up the pessimistic worldview of Celine's novel, whilst contradicting it with critical distance and irony by repeatedly endorsing the quest for a transmundane transcendence, i.e., a salvation by means of another world.

TI  - Estimating stem volume of <i>Eucalyptus</i> sp. and <i>Pinus</i> sp. plantations in Brazil, using Sentinel-1B and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multifrequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been applied to discriminate subtle differences in the vegetation and to better characterize its structural properties, since each SAR frequency will interact with the different sections of the vegetation canopy. In this study, our main objective was to evaluate the use of multifrequency Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data for stem volume estimations in Eucalyptus sp. and Pinus sp. plantations using three different machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). Different experiments were carried out using combinations of predictor variables derived from both SAR sensors: backscattering, polarimetric decompositions, and interferometry data, and field data considering specific models for Eucalyptus sp. and Pinus sp. and a generic model comprising all forest plantations data. The machine learning models using predictor variables derived from SAR data achieved moderately high accuracy to predict stem volume, mainly when SAR data were used in combination with stand age (Experiment iv). In the best prediction scenario (Experiment iv), the RF, SVR, and XGB models were able to explain 81.7%, 68.5%, and 81.8% [coefficient of variation (R-2) values] of stem volume variability considering the generic models, respectively. Our results pointed out that the RF algorithm showed the best performance in predicting stem volume with significant good results and easier implementation in comparison with the other two algorithms (SVR and XGB).

TI  - LAND USE AND COVERAGE IN THE HYDROGRAPHIC BASIN OF RIO NOVO (UGRHI-17) AND PHYSICOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS OF THE WATER AT THE OUTFLOW
T2  - REVISTA FORMACAO ONLINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aimed to verify the influence of land use in the Rio Novo basin on the quality of the water at its outflow at UHE Lucas Nogueira Garcez in Salto Grande / SP. Changes that have occurred in the basin were identified for the assessment simultaneously with the collection of water at the outflow of Rio Novo from September 2017 to August 2018 relating it to the physicochemical parameters of the water, dissolved oxygen, electric conductivity, pH value, water temperature, cloudiness, total suspended solids and clarity, whose parameters are the frameworks of the resolution CONAMA 357/2005. To prepare and identify the land use and land coverage, images of the Landsat 8 satellite sensor OLI has been used. Water analysis has shown that the alterations occurred in land use and coverage in the Rio Novo basin have not influenced the water quality at the outflow of the Salto Grande reservoir on Rio Paranapanema, including in off-season periods, where the vegetation coverage has significantly decreased subjecting the soil to erosive processes as those that occurred in the upper Rio Novo, where erosion susceptibility is identified as high. The survey results show that there is a need for more specific analyses, in order to have indicators which may be tracked from the source to the river mouth as a way of predicting possible environmental damage that may be happening upstream.

TI  - Environmental vulnerability evolution in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Decision making and environmental policies are mainly based on propensity level to impact in the area. The propensity level can be determined through artificial intelligence techniques included in geotechnological universe. Thus, this study aimed to determine the areas of greatest vulnerability to human activities, in Amazon biome, through MODIS images of Land use and land cover (LULC) from the 2001 and 2013. Remote sensing, Euclidean distance, Fuzzy logic, AHP method and analysis of net variations were applied to specialize the classes of vulnerability in the states belonging to the Amazon Biome. From the results, it can be seen that the class that most evolved in a positive net gain during the evaluated period was "very high" and the one that most reduced was "high", showing that there was a transition from "high" to "very high" risk areas. The states with the largest areas under "very high" risk class were Mato Grosso (101,100.10 km2) and Para (81,010.30 km2). It is concluded that the application of remote sensing techniques allows the determination and assessment of the environmental vulnerability evolution. Mitigation measures urgently need to be implemented in the Amazon biome. The methodology can be extended to any other area of the planet.

TI  - Temperature as a likely driver shaping global patterns in mineralogical composition in bryozoans: implications for marine calcifiers under global change.
T2  - Ecography
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Ocean is showing one of the most rapid responses to human-induced global change, thus acting as a sentinel of the effects on marine species and ecosystems. Ocean warming and acidification are already impacting benthic species with carbonate skeletons, but the magnitude of these changes to species and ecosystems remains largely unknown. Here we provide the largest carbonate mineralogical dataset to date for Southern Ocean bryozoans, which are diverse, abundant and important as carbonate producers, thus making them excellent for monitoring the effects of ocean warming and acidification. To improve our understanding of how bryozoans might respond to ocean warming and acidification, we assess latitudinal and seafloor temperature patterns of skeletal mineralogy using bryozoan species occurrences together with temperature data for the first time. Our findings, combining new mineralogical data with published data from warmer regions, show that the proportions of high-Mg calcite and bimineralic species increase significantly towards lower latitudes and with increasing seawater temperature. These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that seawater temperature is likely a significant driver of variations in bryozoan mineralogy at a global scale.

TI  - Ayahuasca: meanings between history, medicine and culture
T2  - APUNTES UNIVERSITARIOS
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay aims to approach the understanding of the meanings of the term ayahuasca, as part of the phytonyms of the Amazonian peoples. However, given the sociocultural attributes, this term encompasses various specializations at the lexical level, also considering the worldview of the native peoples in which it is inscribed on this floor. The methodology used was qualitative, descriptive and cross-sectional. Different disciplinary fields were addressed in reflection on the scope of its use and cultural significance. The sections are related to historical, ritual, medicinal and linguistic aspects. All this leads to an interdisciplinary perspective, which allows us to observe the multiple dimensions of the term, its attributes in the community and the transformations of its meaning in different geographical spaces.

TI  - Productive response of rainbow trout<i> (Oncorhynchus</i><i> mykiss)</i> to the feeding regime with commercial feeds under intensive farming conditions in Lake Titicaca
T2  - REVISTA DE INVESTIGACIONES VETERINARIAS DEL PERU
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of two feeding regimes (7 vs 6 d) and three commercial foods (TO= Tomasino & REG;, NA= Naltech & REG; and SA= Salmofood & REG;) on the productive-commercial performance and organ development of rainbow trout in the fattening phase under conditions of Lake Titicaca, Peru. A total of 1080 trout of 185 g live weight (LW), 26.5 cm total length (TL) and 1.00 body condition index (BCI) were randomly placed in 36 1.2x1.2x1.6 m nylon cages (30 trout/cage). The control of productive parameters (LW, TL and feed consumption) was carried out at 30, 60 and 90 d. The BCI, the mean daily feed intake (DFI), the mean daily weight gain (DWG) and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) were determined. The carcass yield (CY), fillet yield (FY), pigmentation (MP) and the relative weight of the organs were determined at 215 d. The feeding regime did not affect the LW, TL and BCI, but the 7-d feeding had a better FCR (1.12 vs 1.25; p<0.001). Feeding with TO and NA produced lower DFI (3.7, 4.0 and 4.3 g/d; p<0.001), lower DWG (2.9, 3.3 and 4.1 g/d; p<0.001) and worse FCR (1.27, 1.21 and 1.07; p<0.001) with respect to SA at 90 d, respectively. The CY, FY and MP were not affected, but the relative weights of the liver and heart were influenced by feed. It is concluded that the 7-d diet improved feed conversion and pigmentation, while commercial feeds influenced productive performan-ce, pigmentation and relative weight of organs, but not carcass and fillet yield of trout.

TI  - HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS: ENSURING A BALANCE OF PUBLIC INTERESTS
T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers human rights and freedoms in the context of ensuring the balance of public interests. The nature of law, its goals, functions, and mechanisms for implementing and influencing the actors of public life have been topical issues of the theory and practice of regulating public relations and ensuring the stability of a state-organized society. Law is not a natural but rather a social phenomenon. It reflects socio-economic conditions of society and its spiritual culture. It is transformed into a legal reality through the worldview of social actors and its acceptance as a social value that realizes the goals of life. The stability and balance of social relations include the consolidated interests of society members, their culture, and the well-being of the people. Ensuring the balance of public interests requires observance of the principles of law. Administrative-legal relations arise in a special sphere of public life in connection with the implementation of executive and administrative activities by management bodies and officials. Under these conditions, the main features of administrative-legal relations that distinguish them from other public relations are the administrative powers of official administrative bodies and the imperative method which implies the inequality of participants in public relations.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of soil moisture in the experimental agricultural fields
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of the spatial-temporal variability of the field soil moisture content of three experimental fields located in the Perm district of the Perm region were carried out. The experimental conditions were pure fallow. The purpose of the work is to perform a spatio-temporal analysis of soil moisture in experimental fields using mathematical-cartographic and remote sens-ing methods. Field soil moisture was measured by points placed taking into account the heterogeneity of the soil cover and topography conditions. Based on the measurements performed, maps of field soil moisture were created using the "Ordinary Kriging" geostatistical method, using the Geostatistical Analyst module of the ArcGIS 10.1 program. The assessment of the influence of the relief on the moisture was performed using the SRTM global digital elevation model. Indicators calculated were topographic humidity index and closed depressions. Based on the obtained geostatistical layers, the relationship between humidity and Sentinel 2 satellite data was established through the spectral index NDVI. For the initial and final dates of measurements, correlation coefficients 0.8 and 0.9 were obtained. The nature of dependence turned out to be changeable over time. At the beginning of the growing season, the relationship is inverse, which confirms the indicator role of NDVI in moist areas, but starting from the third decade of May, the relationship becomes positive. This is due to the fact that the treatment of soils is not done every day, and seedlings appear earlier in the areas with the greatest moisture. Therefore, during the growing season, the field moisture content through the NDVI is indirectly identified by the value of the plant biomass. For individual measurement dates, a close correlation was established between NDVI raster maps and field humidity (r = 0.86). The result-ing dependence can be used to predict soil moisture in similar areas. The results of the research will be used for differentiated sowing of seeds, taking into account different moisture conditions within the experimental fields.

TI  - Wavelet Spatio-Temporal Change Detection on Multitemporal SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we introduce the wavelet energies correlation screening (WECS), an unsupervised method to detect spatio-temporal changes on multitemporal SAR images. The procedure is based on wavelet approximation for the multitemporal images, wavelet energy apportionment, and ultrahigh-dimensional correlation screening for the wavelet coefficients. We show WECS's performance on simulated multitemporal image data. We also evaluate the proposed method on a time series of 85 Sentinel-1 images of a forest region at the border of Brazil and French Guiana. Comparisons with well-known change detection methods found in the literature highlight the proposal's superiority in terms of change detection accuracy. Additionally, the introduced method has simple architecture and low computational cost.

TI  - A surveillance analysis of case findings in the prevention and control of pneumonia in children under five years old: a literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN AFRICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Background. Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of death in children under 5 years of age. Although overall deaths from pneumonia have decreased substantially by 56%, since 1990 pneumonia contributes to about 740,000 deaths, per year. In Indonesia, in 2021, 444 children under five (CFR 0.16%) died due to pneumonia, in 2020, 498 children under five (CFR 0.16%), and in 2019, 551 children under five (CFR 0.12%). Increasing the scope of finding pneumonia in children under five is one of the efforts done in Indonesia to control pneumonia. The Influenza Like Illness and Severity Acute Respiratory System (ILI-SARI) surveillance is sentinel surveillance that is used to catch cases of pneumonia under five in outpatient and inpatient health facilities.Objective. This literature review aims to describe the implementation of ILI-SARI surveillance increasing the detection of pneumonia in children under five.Methods. The method used is to search the database through Google Scholar, Pubmed, and Research Gate. The key words used in this database search were ILI-SARI surveillance, Pneumonia under five.Results. There are 8 articles obtained and 5 articles analyzed through the suitability of the topic, objectives, methods used, sample size, and results from each article.Conclusion. Care-seeking activities are suggested to be an integral part of this method of preventing and controlling under -five pneumonia.

T2  - ANALES DE LA LITERATURA ESPANOLA CONTEMPORANEA
M3  - Article
AB  - Carlos Bousorio (1923-2015) has a prominent position in the significant and extensive history of Spanish literature written after the Spanish Civil War, due to his tripartite role as poet, theorist of lyric expression, and literary critic. As a writer of poetry, he belongs to the first Postwar generation whose creative approach highlights existentialist themes and social concerns. Bousorio's voice manifests itself in his poetic worldview and in his unique style that would influence the group of the Novisimos. This article contextualizes the author's life and work, describes his path within the literary environment of his historical period, and emphasizes the core ideas that Bousofio would repeat and develop throughout the trajectory of his lyrical work.

CP  - 10th European Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (EWSHM)

AB  - The work aims to show some preliminary results coming from a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems network. This latter is composed by five building located in the city of L'Aquila that is hosting SICURA - "caSa Intelligente delle teCnologie per la sicURezza - L'Aquila" one of the 5 "houses of emerging technologies" (Case delle Tecnologie Emergenti) promoted by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MiSE) to promote the exploitation of 5G, IoT and blockchain technologies to improve the public safety. Advantages coming from such new technologies will have beneficial effects in the management of the monitored structural data and information. One of the most relevant consists in the designing and implementation of possible strategy of early warning solutions in case of seismic events. Indeed, the 5G-based architecture can reduce the latency and increase the reliability of the measured and transmitted data. Another aspect regards the improvements connected to traditional monitoring and control procedures of the buildings. The continuous and synchronized knowledge of the whole structural health network allows to quickly identify the areas most affected during and after a critical event. A single building constitutes a sort of sentinel addressing in opportune and adequate way the emergency interventions. Such scenario poses the bases for the developing of Digital Twin models at single building and city level.

TI  - Multidisciplinary ecosystem to study lifecourse determinants and prevention of early-onset burdensome multimorbidity (MELD-B) - protocol for a research collaboration.
T2  - Journal of multimorbidity and comorbidity
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Most people living with multiple long-term condition multimorbidity (MLTC-M) are under 65 (defined as 'early onset'). Earlier and greater accrual of long-term conditions (LTCs) may be influenced by the timing and nature of exposure to key risk factors, wider determinants or other LTCs at different life stages. We have established a research collaboration titled 'MELD-B' to understand how wider determinants, sentinel conditions (the first LTC in the lifecourse) and LTC accrual sequence affect risk of early-onset, burdensome MLTC-M, and to inform prevention interventions.Aim: Our aim is to identify critical periods in the lifecourse for prevention of early-onset, burdensome MLTC-M, identified through the analysis of birth cohorts and electronic health records, including artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced analyses.Design: We will develop deeper understanding of 'burdensomeness' and 'complexity' through a qualitative evidence synthesis and a consensus study. Using safe data environments for analyses across large, representative routine healthcare datasets and birth cohorts, we will apply AI methods to identify early-onset, burdensome MLTC-M clusters and sentinel conditions, develop semi-supervised learning to match individuals across datasets, identify determinants of burdensome clusters, and model trajectories of LTC and burden accrual. We will characterise early-life (under 18 years) risk factors for early-onset, burdensome MLTC-M and sentinel conditions. Finally, using AI and causal inference modelling, we will model potential 'preventable moments', defined as time periods in the life course where there is an opportunity for intervention on risk factors and early determinants to prevent the development of MLTC-M. Patient and public involvement is integrated throughout.

TI  - HGF Spatial-Spectral Fusion Method for Hyperspectral Images
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative studies on surface elements require satellite hyperspectral images with high spatial resolution. The identification of different surface elements requires different characteristic bands and their corresponding optimal spatial-spectral fusion methods. To address these problems, the harmonic analysis (HA), guided filtering, and Gram-Schmidt (GS) algorithms were integrated to propose a spatial-spectral fusion method called HGF. The fusion experiment and validation of the hyperspectral images of GaoFen-5 (GF-5) and ZY1-02D were conducted separately using the HGF method, and the fusion effect was evaluated in three band intervals according to the spectral response of the ground class. First, HGF was used to fuse the GF-5 and GaoFen-1 (GF-1) images, and the fusion effect was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Second, the optimal fusion method was selected for the corresponding characteristic bands of the different surface elements. Finally, the hyperspectral image obtained by ZY1-02D and multispectral image of Sentinel-2B were used for validation to improve the accuracy and efficiency of satellite hyperspectral images in quantitative studies. The results show that for further studies on soil, vegetation, and water bodies, the best fusion methods in the 390-730, 730-1400, and 1400-2260 nm intervals are the GS, HGF, and HGF algorithms, respectively. Further analysis showed that the HGF or GS methods can be selected for quantitative studies on vegetation and water bodies and that the HGF method exhibits outstanding advantages for quantitative analysis of each soil element.

TI  - Bias Correction of Sentinel-2 MSI Vegetation Indices in a Desert Steppe With Original Assembled Field Online Multiangle Spectrometers
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In desert steppe regions with sparse vegetation, there are discrepancies between vertical and oblique observations made by satellite-based sensors. In this study, we developed and deployed an online multiangle spectrometer in the desert steppe area of Inner Mongolia, China, to calibrate satellite based vegetation indices. One of the key components of the device is a specially designed quarter-arc iron track that holds the fixed view angles of 30?, 45?, 60?, 75?, and 90? that are fixed. These observation positions equipped with high-efficiency multichannel sensors can capture the reflectance of ground objects at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Real-time experiments were conducted with multiple observation angles and an error-based view angle correction model was constructed to reconcile the differences between angular and vertical observations. The calculated results were subsequently applied to the bias-correction process of the Sentinel-2 vegetation index. Across all view angles, the daily distributions of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ratio vegetation index (RVI) exhibited a U-shaped pattern with the nadir occurring at noon. Among the data, RVI demonstrated superior overall stability compared to NDVI. However, with vegetation growth, the NDVI showed less sensitivity, resulting in a decrease in its coefficient of variation (CV) from 32.3% to 18.2%. To correct the bias in Sentinel-2 products, we initially applied path length correction (PLC) to eliminate the topographic influence on the Band4 and Band8 band reflectance. Our findings revealed that Band8 performed better than Band4 in mitigating the effects of topography, as evidenced by a decrease in the determination coefficient from 0.448 to 0.09. In addition, we corrected the view angle error of the NDVI of Sentinel-2 by constructing a view angle correction model (R2 = 0.84 and RMSE = 0.03). The corrected images exhibited significant variation characteristics in areas with relatively large view angles. The results of this study provide valuable scientific support for the correction of satellite image products and the accurate detection of vegetation through remote sensing in regions with low vegetation coverage.

AB  - Studying the ecosystem service value is of great value for solving the contradiction between ecological protection and economic development in the Huaihe River Basin. The characteristics of land use change were studied by using the Landsat remote sensing image data of Anhui section and Henan section of Huaihe River Basin from 2010 to 2020. The equivalent factor method was used to estimate the ecosystem service value, and the spatial autocorrelation model was used to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of ecosystem service value The GM-BP model was used to predict the land use change in 2025. The results showed that: (1) From 2010 to 2020, cultivated land and construction land dominated the land use in the study area, and the degree of land use change changed from severe to stable. (2) The value of ecosystem services is in the transition stage from low level (II) to medium level (III). (3) ecosystem service value has a significant positive spatial correlation, and the spatial distribution is generally high in the southeast and low in the northwest. (4) Compared with 2020, ecosystem service value will rise by 0.54 % in 2025.

The Conclusion. Modern rapid increase in biographical research, growth of general interest in biographical studies became possible owing to Ukraine's independence. Researchers focused on representatives of the creative minority of Western Ukrainians, who had a direct impact on the cultural and intellectual development of citizenship, participated in the formation or design of new ethical and behavioral models, scientific views, worldview formation of people. The peculiarity of the Western Ukrainian elite consisted in the fact that its spokesmen were closely connected with social and political movement, national life. Historical portraits of M. Vozniak, M. Halushchynskyi, V. Hnatiuk, S. Dnistrianskyi, M. Korduba, I. Krevetskyi, I. Krypiakevych, K. Levytskyi, M. Lozynskyi, V. Mudry, Yu. Romanchuk, K. Studynskyi, S. Rudnytskyi, V. Starosolskyi, S. Tomashivskyi are well presented relatively. At the same time, there is a need to continue research using the prosopographic method in order to replenish the information base on the individual activities of famous teachers, scholars, public figures - I. Bryk, I. Halushchynsky, F. Kolessa, D. Korenets, O. Terletsky, V. Shchurat, Ya. Voytiuk, K. Soshynsky, and the others. Topical is the issue of taking into consideration the entire complex of facts of a personal, professional, situational and bibliographic nature, without which it is impossible to write scientific biographies of intellectual and cultural figures.

TI  - Monitoring Land Cover Change in the Southeastern Baltic Sea Since the 1980s by Remote Sensing

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference of European Spatial Data for Coastal and Marine Remote Sensing (EUCOMARE)
CL  - Saint Malo, FRANCE
AB  - The political, economic, and social changes associated with the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of the 1980s led to major land cover and land-use changes in the southeastern Baltic Sea coastal regions. These changes (demilitariza-tion of the coasts, end of collective ownership, specialization of economic activities, etc.) are characterized by a fast process of coastalization with the growth of urban areas, coast suburbanization, and the decrease of agricultural land. At the same time, we observe the implementation of protected natural areas at the regional level and through cross-border cooperation with international organizations (UNESCO, European Union [EU], etc.). Both processes have an important impact on the man-agement of the coastlines of Latvia, Lithuania, and Russia. The analysis of the coastal changes is based on the use of Landsat remote sensing data series from the 1980s to 2020 combined with EU geographic databases and the land-use plans. The comparative analysis of the land cover changes in the Oblast of Kaliningrad, Lithuanian, and Latvian coastal zones allows us to understand the impacts of the three different planning policies since the end of the 1980s. The territorial dynamics are modelled using the GEOBIA package with object-oriented classification and machine-learning algorithms (maximum likelihood, minimum distance to means, parallelepiped classifiers) applied to the Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI satellite multispectral images. The produced land cover maps are compared with the Climate Change Initiative Land Cover of the European Space Agency from 1995 to 2015.

TI  - Detection of Bastnasite-Rich Veins in Rare Earth Element Ores Through Hyperspectral Imaging
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral indices are a well-established remote sensing tool showcased in many studies pertaining to fields such as agriculture, forest ecology, geology, soil sciences, vegetation, water resources, and urban development. In the case of geology, several indices already exist for the purpose of highlighting regions with interesting lithologies, such as iron oxides, aluminous clays, carbonates, and mafic to ultramafic minerals, based on signature absorption features in their reflectance spectra. However, in the literature, most indices often depend on the few, wide spectral bands used by spaceborne multispectral imagers such as Landsat 8 OLI, Terra ASTER, and Sentinel-2 MSI. Hyperspectral imagers are able to glean more detailed compositional information about a rock surface by operating with a myriad of narrow spectral bands, though the usage of these bands in spectral indices for mining and exploration purposes remains largely unexplored. We propose a new bastnasite index (BI) capable of detecting the presence of rare earth elements (REEs) and mapping their relative abundances across rock surfaces. Using four reference bands and four absorption bands in the visible to near-infrared wavelength range, we apply this novel technique in a laboratory setting to ore samples extracted from the carbonatite body localized in the Sulfide Queen mine in Mountain Pass, CA, USA. Visual inspection is used to compare an index map to corresponding reflectance spectra for areas of known high and low REE abundances, demonstrating its potential as a fast and straightforward means to assess REE ore grade remotely.

TI  - A simple method for the estimation of minimum and maximum air temperature monthly mean maps using MODIS images in the region of Murcia, Spain
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature records are acquired by networks of weather stations which may be several kilometres apart. In complex topographies the representativeness of a meteorological station may be diminished in relation to a flatter valley, and the nearest station may have no relation to a place located near it. The present study shows a simple method to estimate the spatial distribution of minimum and maximum air temperatures from MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images. Indeed, there is a strong correlation between MODIS day and night LST products and air temperature records from meteorological stations, which is obtained by using geographically weighted regression equations, and reliable results are found. Then, the results allow to spatially interpolate the coefficients of the local regressions using altitude and NDVI as descriptor variables, to obtain maps of the whole region for minimum and maximum air temperature. Most of the meteorological stations show air temperature estimates that do not have significant differences compared to the measured values. The results showed that the regression coefficients for the selected locations are strong for the correlations between minimum temperature with LSTnight (R2 = 0.69-0.82) and maximum temperature with LSTday (R2 = 0.70-0.87) at the 47 stations. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of the statistical models are 1.0 degrees C and 0.8 degrees C for night and daytime temperatures, respectively. Furthermore, the association between each pair of data is significant at the 95% level (p<0.01).

TI  - THREE DECADES OF REMOTE SENSING ANALYSIS ON FOREST DECLINE RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE: A BIBLIOMETRIC STUDY
T2  - CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is predicted to lead to increasingly intense and hotter droughts, causing physiological weakness followed by forest decline in many regions of the world. Long-and short-range remote sensing (satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly called drones) can sense drought-induced changes in vegetation. Although several studies have addressed forest decline events, none have analyzed the forest decline attributable to climate change using remote sensing in a concise manner. A bibliometric analysis was carried out to characterize the scientific production reported in the Web of Science repository. The search descriptors were a combination of keywords related to forest decline and remote sensing. The results showed 278 articles published between 1989 and 2021 in 92 journals, with an average annual increase of 31%. A total of 29 nodes and 220 scientific collaboration links were located, mainly led by researchers from USA, Germany and China. Keyword analysis using World-TreeMap reflected the association of different key forest decline phenomena such as drought stress and climate change. Although the use of satellite information to study and understand forest decline has been reported for just over three decades, the most notable feature of the present research was the limited role of drones with only 5 studies. This reveals an area of opportunity to take advantage of the main strengths of drones, i.e., spatial and temporal resolution, low cost compared to manned flights, and centimeter accuracy. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to increase studies to improve the use of multispectral sensors, thermal and LiDAR technology for long-term monitoring of forest decline related to climate change.

TI  - Soil Erosion Satellite-Based Estimation in Cropland for Soil Conservation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive cropland expansion for an increasing population has driven soil degradation worldwide. Modeling how agroecosystems respond to variations in soil attributes, relief and crop management dynamics can guide soil conservation. This research presents a new approach to evaluate soil loss by water erosion in cropland using the RUSLE model and Synthetic Soil Image (spectroscopy technique), which uses time series remotely sensed environmental, agricultural and anthropic variables, in the southeast region of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The availability of the open-access satellite images of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Landsat satellite images provided ten years of rainfall data and 35 years of exposed soil surface. The bare soil surface and agricultural land use were extracted, and the multi-temporal rainfall erosivity was assessed. We predict soil maps' attributes (texture and organic matter) through innovative soil spectroscopy techniques to assess the soil erodibility and soil loss tolerance. The erosivity, erodibility, and topography obtained by the Earth observations were adopted to estimate soil erosion in four scenarios of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) residue coverage (0%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in five years of the sugarcane cycle: the first year of sugarcane harvest and four subsequent harvesting years from 2013 to 2017. Soil loss tolerance means 4.3 Mg ha(-1) exceeds the minimum rate in 40% of the region, resulting in a total soil loss of similar to 6 million Mg yr(-1) under total coverage management (7 Mg ha(-1)). Our findings suggest that sugarcane straw production has not been sufficient to protect the soil loss against water erosion. Thus, straw removal is unfeasible unless alternative conservation practices are adopted, such as minimum soil tillage, contour lines, terracing and other techniques that favor increases in organic matter content and soil flocculating cations. This research also identifies a spatiotemporal erosion-prone area that requests an immediately sustainable land development guide to restore and rehabilitate the vulnerable ecosystem service. The high-resolution spatially distribution method provided can identify soil degradation-prone areas and the cropland expansion frequency. This information may guide farms and the policymakers for a better request of conservation practices according to site-specific management variation.

TI  - Occurrence Rate of Hot Jupiters Around Early-type M Dwarfs Based on Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite Data
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an estimate of the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters (7 RED Rp 2 RJ, 0.8 Pb 10 days) around early-type M dwarfs based on stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) during its primary mission. We adopt stellar parameters from the TESS Input Catalog and construct a sample of 60,819 M dwarfs with 10.5 <= T-mag <= 13.5, effective temperatures 2900 <= T-eff <= 4000 K, and stellar masses 0.45 M* 0.65 Me. We conduct a uninformed transit search using a detection pipeline based on the box least square search and characterize the searching completeness through an injection and recovery experiment. We combine a series of vetting steps including light centroid measurement, odd/even and secondary eclipse analysis, rotation and transit period synchronization tests as well as inspecting the ground-based photometric, spectroscopic, and imaging observations. Finally, we find a total of nine planet candidates, all of which are known TESS objects of interest. We obtain an occurrence rate of 0.27% +/- 0.09% for hot Jupiters around early-type M dwarfs that satisfy our selection criteria. Compared with previous studies, the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters around early-type M dwarfs is smaller than all measurements for FGK stars, although they are consistent within 1a--2a-. There is a trend that the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters has a peak at G dwarfs and falls toward both hotter and cooler stars. Combining results from transit, radial velocity, and microlensing surveys, we find that hot Jupiters around early-type M dwarfs possibly show a steeper decrease in the occurrence rate per logarithmic semimajor axis bin (dN d log(10) a) when compared with FGK stars.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are considered the most dynamic and remarkable features of earth and are highly sensitive indicators of climatic change and global warming. The continuous retreat of glaciers in the Himalayan region can have serious impacts in the region. So, there is a dire need for timely glacier mapping and monitoring for planning and management of water resources. The study focuses on the dynamic responses of glaciers in the Harmukh range, Kashmir Himalaya using satellite imagery from 1980 to 2020. The total area of the glaciers (G-I to G-VII) has reduced from 6.962 km(2) in 1980 to 5.468 km(2) in 2020, a deglaciation of 1.493 km(2) (21.44%), whereas the glacial area of 0.499 km(2) (14.55%) has lost in the Harmukh glacier (G-I) during this period. The snout position and ELA have shown upward shifts, with varying rates at different time intervals in the Harmukh glacier (G-I). The specific mass balance (SMB) of the Harmukh glacier (G-I) changed from 33.15 cm water equivalent (w.e.) to 7.27 cm water equivalent (w.e.) during the observation period. Adverse effects may prevail in the flow of streams and water-dependent regions of the area if the similar situation persisted in these glaciers.

TI  - Feature level fusion for land cover classification with landsat images: A hybrid classification model
T2  - MULTIAGENT AND GRID SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of land cover using satellite images was a major area for the past few years. A raise in the quantity of data obtained by satellite image systems insists on the requirement for an automated tool for classification. Satellite images demonstrate temporal or/and spatial dependencies, where the traditional artificial intelligence approaches do not succeed to execute well. Hence, the suggested approach utilizes a brand-new framework for classifying land cover Histogram Linearisation is first carried out throughout pre-processing. The features are then retrieved, including spectral and spatial features. Additionally, the generated features are merged throughout the feature fusion process. Finally, at the classification phase, an optimized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Deep Belief Network (DBN) are introduced that portrays classified results in a precise way. Especially, the Opposition Behavior Learning based Water Wave Optimization (OBL-WWO) model is used for tuning the weights of LSTM and DBN. Atlast, many metrics illustrate the new approach's effectiveness.

TI  - Marking Techniques for Targeted Axillary Dissection Among Patients With Node-Positive Breast Cancer Treated With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - BREAST CANCER-BASIC AND CLINICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Invasive breast cancer with axillary lymph node (LN) invasion is a continuing problem worldwide. The morbidity associated with axillary LN dissection along with the high rate of nodal downstaging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) made the standard treatment shift towards less invasive surgery. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NACT is associated with high false-negative rates (13%-14%). To overcome this problem, it was concluded that the positive nodes should first be indicated with image-detectable markers and then removed together with SLNB: targeted axillary dissection (TAD). This review aims to describe and evaluate the different marking techniques for TAD in patients with node-positive breast cancer treated with NACT, namely: clip placement and guidewire localization; clip placement and 125I-labelled radioactive seed localization; clip placement and skin mark; clip placement and intraoperative ultrasound; tattooing with a sterile black carbon suspension; magnetic seeds; radar and infrared light technology localization. Targeted axillary dissection techniques have shown false-negative rates below 9% and identification rates above 95%. The most studied technique is guidewire localization, as it is also the oldest one. However, according to data gathered from this review, some newer techniques have shown to be very promising due to their statistical results and management factors.

TI  - A Multi-Band Atmospheric Correction Algorithm for Deriving Water Leaving Reflectances over Turbid Waters from VIIRS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current operational multi-band atmospheric correction algorithms implemented by NASA and NOAA for global remote sensing of ocean color from VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) data are mostly based on the 2-band version of the SeaWiFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor) algorithm. These algorithms generally use two NIR bands, one centered near 0.75 mu m and the other near 0.865 mu m, and a band ratio method for deriving aerosol information. The algorithms work quite well over open ocean waters. However, water leaving reflectances over turbid coastal waters are frequently not derived. We describe here a spectrum-matching algorithm using shortwave IR (SWIR) bands above 1 mu m for retrieving water leaving reflectances in the visible from VIIRS data. The SWIR bands centered near 1.24, 1.61, and 2.25 mu m are used in a spectrum-matching process to obtain spectral aerosol information, which is subsequently extrapolated to the visible region for the derivation of water leaving reflectances of visible bands. We present retrieval results for four VIIRS scenes acquired over turbid waters. We demonstrate that the spatial coverages of our retrieving results can be improved significantly in comparison with those retrieved with the current NOAA operational algorithm. If our SWIR algorithm is implemented for operational data processing, the algorithm can potentially be complimentary to current NASA and NOAA VIIRS algorithms over turbid waters to increase spatial coverages.

TI  - Cross-Modality Features Fusion for Synthetic Aperture Radar Image Segmentation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image segmentation stands as a formidable research frontier within the domain of SAR image interpretation. The fully convolutional network (FCN) methods have recently brought remarkable improvements in SAR image segmentation. Nevertheless, these methods do not utilize the peculiarities of SAR images, leading to suboptimal segmentation accuracy. To address this issue, we rethink SAR image segmentation in terms of sequential information of transformers and cross-modal features. We first discuss the peculiarities of SAR images and extract the mean and texture features utilized as auxiliary features. The extraction of auxiliary features helps unearth the distinctive information in the SAR images. Afterward, a feature-enhanced FCN with the transformer encoder structure, termed FE-FCN, can be extracted to context- and pixel-level features. In FE-FCN, the features of a single-mode encoder are aligned and inserted into the model to explore the potential correspondence between modes. We also employ long skip connections to share each modality's distinguishing and particular features. Finally, we present the connection-enhanced conditional random field (CE-CRF) to capture the connection information of the image pixels. Since the CE-CRF utilizes the auxiliary features to enhance the reliability of the connection information, the segmentation results of FE-FCN are further optimized. Comparative experiments were conducted on the Fangchenggang (FCG), Pucheng (PC), and Gaofen (GF) SAR datasets. Our method demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy compared to other conventional image segmentation methods, as confirmed by the experimental results.

TI  - Phenology-Based Remote Sensing Assessment of Crop Water Productivity
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of crop water productivity (CWP) is of practical significance for improving regional agricultural water use efficiency and water conservation levels. The remote sensing method is a common method for estimating large scale CWP, and the assessment errors in CWP by remote sensing originate mainly from remote sensing inversion errors in crop yield and evapotranspiration (ET). The phenological period is the important factor in crop ET and yield estimation. The crop coefficient (Kc) and harvest index (HI), which are closely related to different phenological periods, are considered during the processes of crop ET and yield estimation. The crop phenological period is detected from enhanced vegetation index (EVI) curves using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and Sentinel-2 data. The crop ET is estimated using the surface-energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) model and Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation, and the crop yield is estimated using the dry matter mass-harvest index method. The CWP is calculated as the ratio of the crop yield to ET during the growing season. The results show that the daily ET and crop yield estimated from remote sensing images are consistent with the measured values. It is found from the variation in daily ET that the peaks appear at the heading period of wheat and maize, which are in good agreement with the rainfall and growth characteristics of the crop. The relationship between crop yield and ET shows a negative parabolic correlation, and that between CWP and crop yield shows a linear correlation. The average CWPs of wheat and maize are 1.60 kg/m(3) and 1.39 kg/m(3), respectively. The results indicate that the phenology-based remote sensing inversion method has a good effect on the assessment of CWP in Lixin County.

TI  - BS<SUP>3</SUP>LNet: A New Blind-Spot Self-Supervised Learning Network for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent years have witnessed the flourishing of deep learning-based methods in hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD). However, the lack of available supervision information persists throughout. In addition, existing unsupervised learning/semisupervised learning methods to detect anomalies utilizing reconstruction errors not only generate backgrounds but also reconstruct anomalies to some extent, complicating the identification of anomalies in the original hyperspectral image (HSI). In order to train a network able to reconstruct only background pixels (instead of anomalous pixels), in this article, we propose a new blind-spot self-supervised learning network (called BS(3)LNet) that generates training patch pairs with blind spots from a single HSI and trains the network in self-supervised fashion. The BS(3)LNet tends to generate high reconstruction errors for anomalous pixels and low reconstruction errors for background pixels due to the fact that it adopts a blind-spot architecture, i.e., the receptive field of each pixel excludes the pixel itself and the network reconstructs each pixel using its neighbors. The above characterization suits the HAD task well, considering the fact that spectral signatures of anomalous targets are significantly different from those of neighboring pixels. Our network can be considered a superb background generator, which effectively enhances the semantic feature representation of the background distribution and weakens the feature expression for anomalies. Meanwhile, the differences between the original HSI and the background reconstructed by our network are used to measure the degree of the anomaly of each pixel so that anomalous pixels can be effectively separated from the background. Extensive experiments on two synthetic and three real datasets reveal that our BS(3)LNet is competitive with regard to other state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - A 40-Year 1-km Daily Seamless Near-Surface Air Temperature Product Over Yellow River Basin of China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface air temperature (NSAT) is an important environmental parameter; however, there is a lack of long-term, fine-scale NSAT products that offer complete spatiotemporal continuity. Although several available products cover different periods and regions, obtaining gridded NSAT data outside of the provided regions and periods remains challenging. Using multiple source data (ERA5-Land, global land data assimilation system, remotely-sensed data, and several auxiliary factors), a new high-efficient framework for estimating NSAT is presented using the random forest algorithm and implemented on the Google Earth Engine platform in this study. Thereby, the 1-km daily seamless NSAT product (containing daily maximum, mean, and minimum) from January 1st 1981 to December 31st 2020 over the Yellow River Basin in China is generated. To our knowledge, this is the first product that satisfies the conditions of high resolution, seamless coverage, and long-term continuity simultaneously for the Yellow River Basin. Tenfold cross validation shows that the RMSE, MAE, and R-2 for the maximum NSAT are 1.746-1.932 K, 1.351-1.486 K, and 0.968-0.974, respectively; for the mean NSAT are 1.219-1.354 K, 0.940-1.035 K, and 0.984-0.987; and for the minimum daily NSAT are 1.663-1.732 K, 1.280-1.322 K, and 0.975-0.997. In addition, a user-friendly NSAT estimation tool was developed for the first time, enabling users to derive NSAT products for specific areas and time periods of interest. Evaluation of the tool indicates that the accuracy of temporally extended NSAT is satisfactory, while the accuracy of spatially extended NSAT is lower compared to the original region. The generated long-term finer-scale NSAT product and the developed NSAT estimation tool hold potential benefits for ecoclimate researchers and environmental policy makers.

TI  - Potential of Remote Sensing Images for Soil Moisture Retrieving Using Ensemble Learning Methods in Vegetation-Covered Area
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in various fields such as agriculture, hydrology, and land-atmosphere interactions. This study aims to evaluate the performance of the categorical boosting algorithm (CatBoost) in comparison to other multiple-boosting algorithms for SM prediction. Appropriate feature selection is vital for achieving accurate predictions, and this study focuses on identifying relevant features and assessing CatBoost's suitability for the task. The study incorporates several boosting algorithms including Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and CatBoost to estimate SM. Results indicate that radar backscatter coefficient, soil roughness, and digital elevation model (DEM) are crucial features for SM retrieval. Comparatively, CatBoost outperforms GBDT, XGBoost, and LightGBM in various feature combinations. The most favorable results are obtained when utilizing all features as inputs for the algorithm. These optimal results yield a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.40 vol.%, mean relative error (MRE) of 0.16 vol.%, root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.26 vol.%, and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.73. Additionally, the study analyzes the inversion results for different ranges of SM and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Within the range of SM from 0 to 25 vol.% and NDVI from 0 to 0.7, utilizing all features yields the most accurate results. Using CatBoost, this approach achieves an MAE of 1.52 vol.%, MRE of 0.12 vol.%, RMSE of 2.11 vol.%, and R of 0.81. The study suggests that applying boosting algorithms, especially CatBoost, holds promise in accurately estimating surface SM.

TI  - A Combined RFI Localization Algorithm of BT Image and Subspace Decomposition for Synthetic Aperture Interferometric Radiometer
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radio frequency interferences (RFIs) in the L-band heavily contaminate remote sensing data and bring many challenges to the product quality of synthesis aperture interferometric radiometers (SAIRs). Detecting and localizing RFIs is the urgent need for switching off these RFIs and conducting mitigation algorithms. The localization algorithm based on the brightness temperature (BT) image is limited by the resolution to separate closely spaced RFIs and achieve high localization accuracy in some cases. To achieve super-resolution, the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) methods using the subspace decomposition technique are suggested. Nevertheless, when the BT image signal-noise ratio (SNR) is low, the power of RFI is insufficient to overwhelm the background scene, and the performance of the MUSIC algorithm is unsatisfactory. In this article, a further improvement is proposed by combining BT image and subspace decomposition. In the BT image domain, background scene cancellation and RFI target enhancement are carried out for enhancing the SNR. In the frequency domain, the MUSIC algorithm is applied to utilize subspace-decomposition to achieve super-resolution localization. Experiments and simulations based on Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) data validate that the method presented in this article performs better than both the classical MUSIC algorithm and BT-based localization algorithm in low SNR cases.

TI  - Phenology Metrics for Vegetation Type Classification in Estuarine Wetlands Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - While the efficiency of incorporating phenology features into vegetation type classification, in general, and coastal wetland vegetation classification, in particular, has been verified, it is difficult to acquire high-spatial-resolution (HSR) images taken at appropriate times for vegetation identification using phenology features because of the coastal climate and the HSR satellite imaging cycle. To strengthen phenology feature differences, in this study, we constructed vegetation phenology metrics according to vegetation NDVI time series curves fitted by samples collected from the Linhong Estuary Wetland and Liezi Estuary Wetland based on Gao Fen (GF) series satellite images taken between 2018 and 2022. Next, we calculated the phenology metrics using GF series satellite imagery taken over the most recent complete phenology cycle: 21 October 2020, 9 January 2021, 19 February 2021, and 8 May 2021. Five vegetation type classifications in the Linhong Estuary Wetland were carried out using single images of 21 October 2020 and 8 May 2021, along with their combination and the further addition of phenology metrics. From our comparison and analysis, the following findings emerged: Combining the images taken in 21 October 2020 and 8 May 2021 provided better vegetation classification accuracy than any single image, and the overall accuracy was, respectively, increased from 47% and 48% to 67%, while the corresponding kappa was increased from 33% and 34% to 58%; however, adding phenology metrics further improved the accuracy by decreasing the effect of some confusion among different vegetation types, and the overall accuracy and kappa were further improved to 75% and 69%, respectively. Though some problems remain to be further dealt with, this exploration offers helpful insights into coastal wetland vegetation classification using phenology based on HSR imagery.

TI  - Cross-Scale Mixing Attention for Multisource Remote Sensing Data Fusion and Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral and multispectral images (HS/MS) fusion and classification as an important branch of data quality improvement and interpretation have attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, the unavailable sensor prior still limits the performance of many traditional fusion methods, consequently deteriorating the classification results. Despite the unsupervised methods based on convolutional neural network (CNN) making a lot of attempts to mitigate the limitations, challenges with extracting the long-range dependencies hamper the performance. To address these impediments, a transformer-based baseline constructed by the cross-scale mixing attention transformer (CSMFormer) is designed for HS/MS fusion and classification. Especially, the spatial-spectral mixer (SSMixer) is utilized to extract the long-range dependencies at a large scale. Simultaneously, cross-scale feature calibration is achieved by combining information from the original scale. After that, the nonlinear enhancement module (NLEM) is designed to encourage feature discrimination. Note that the spatial and spectral mixers can be replaced by any spatial-spectral feature extractors. Therefore, the proposed CSMFormer is flexible in data fusion, land-covers' classification, segmentation, and so on. Experiments about data fusion and land-covers' classification on two HS/MS wetland remote sensing scenes demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CSMFormer baseline, improving the data quality and classification precision.

TI  - Adversarial Complementary Learning for Multisource Remote Sensing Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted increasing attention in the field of multimodal cooperation. Recently, the adoption of CNN-based methods has achieved remarkable performance in multisource remote sensing data classification. However, it is still confronted with challenges in the aspect of complementarity extraction. In this article, the adversarial complementary learning (ACL) strategy is embedded into the CNN model called ACL-CNN, which is employed to extract the complementary information of the multisource data. The proposed ACL-CNN is able to filter out the common patterns and specific patterns from multisource data by conducting the adversarial max-min game. Especially, the modality-independent common patterns constitute the basic representation of the land covers, while the specific patterns are linearly independent of the common patterns that provide the supplementary representation. Therefore, the complementary information is mapped to a compact and discriminative representation. To eliminate the singularity noise, a learnable pattern sampling module (PSM) is designed to extract the mutual-exclusion relationship between specific patterns. Extensive experiments over three datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ACL-CNN compared with several classification technologies.

TI  - A Spatial PWV Retrieval Model Over Land for GCOM-W/AMSR2 Using Neural Network Method: A Case in the Western United States
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is an important and active part of the atmosphere. As known, microwave PWV retrieval is well applied for the ocean but challenging over land. In this article, we creatively established a microwave PWV retrieval spatial model over land using the backpropagation neural network to combine the high precision ground-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data and high spatial continuity satellite-borne data. Three-year data from 167 GNSS stations located in western America were utilized for training the network, and 40 untrained sites were selected as the test set. Root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the test set can reach 3.90 and 3.88 mm in the ascending (As) and descending (De) orbits, respectively. Then, we analyzed the influence of land cover types on the model over land. As a result, we found that stations located in the area with a single large-scale continuous land cover type had higher retrieval accuracy. In contrast, stations with diversified land cover types had lower precision. Furthermore, after fully considering the impact of land cover type, we performed an improved model with 61 stations on the single large-scale continuous grasslands, and the results of 8 stations as the test set showed that the RMSE could reach 3.41 and 3.31 mm in the As and De orbits, respectively. Compared with the spatial model established previously, the accuracy had been improved by about 13%. We think this is due to the stable physical properties (such as microwave emissivity) of the single large-scale continuous land cover type.

TI  - Multi-View Clustering-Based Time Series Empirical Tropospheric Delay Correction
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric delays (TDs) still hinder the millimeter-scale measurement accuracy of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). Toward higher accuracy, this letter presents a new time series TDs correction method. The rationale behind the proposed method is that multi-view clustering (MvC) is introduced to identify the spatiotemporal TDs behaviors, particularly, in which the one-pass multi-view clustering (OPMC) algorithm is employed to perform window segmentation rather than sticking to the commonly used boxcar windows. Next, a phase-elevation network correction model in each cluster is constructed by fully considering the spatiotemporal phase information. Besides, an iterative weighted scheme is designed to further enhance the robustness of the estimated model parameters. The Sentinel-1 datasets covering the southwest mountainous area, China, confirm the effectiveness of the new method.

AB  - PhenoApp application have been developed within the framework of the eLTER Plus and SUMHAL projects, as a tool aimed at scientists and managers of the sites integrated in the eLTER network, for which long-term phenology monitoring can be assessed. The application provides a dynamic map that allows the selection of any site in the network and queries the phenological metrics of each pixel or group of pixels generated with the Sentinel-2 time series of images using the Ndvi2Gif and PhenoPY python libraries. The application also integrates phenology products from MODIS (MCD12Q2.006) and Copernicus Sentinel 2 High Resolution Vegetation Phenology Product (HR VPP). In addition, the application incorporates a web form that allows the user to provide the phenology data obtained in situ (through direct observation or phenocams), which will be used to perform a validation of the different products obtained via satellite. As an example, we carried out a preliminary validation in one of the sites of the eLTER network located in the Donana Natural Area (END). We used in situ data provided by the network of phenocams in the Donana Biological Reserve since 2016 installed by the Singular Scientific and Technical Infrastructure of Donana (ICTS-Donana). A preliminary validation analysis highlights the need to consider the discrepancies between the different products and methods according to the phenological variability inherent in each ecosystem.

T2  - RECERCA-REVISTA DE PENSAMENT & ANALISI
M3  - Article
AB  - The indianist sumak kawsay had a special political and intellectual relevance in Ecuador (and Bolivia) in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Since then, the influence of its approaches -and those of the different branches of good living- has grown and formed synergies with other heterodox trends such as degrowth, feminist economics and deep ecology, among others. The global pandemic of COVID-19 has highlighted the incompatibility of the capitalist system and the paradigms that sustain it with the life of the planet and of people. This article reflects on the proposals that are emerging around the construction of a globalsumak kawsay as an alternative to development and capitalism, showing the potentialities and weaknesses of this philosophy, worldview and way of life from a postmodern perspective.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Integrated Optics - Devices, Materials, and Technologies XXVII

AB  - Integrated photonics on glass offers advantages for sensing applications because of its relative low cost and its detection sensitivity. In this paper we discuss the design, fabrication and characterization of a micro device for sorting and sensing dielectric microparticles. The target application is the analysis of bacteria used as sentinel for water pollution. The sorting function, that does not include any functionalization layer, is done by means of dielectrophoretic forces. They are induced by castellated electrodes fed by a low frequency electric signal. The sensing function is obtained by a surface waveguide that is perturbed by the particles collected on top of it by dielectrophoresis. We first discuss the co-integration of the castellated electrodes with an optical waveguide. An efficient interaction of polystyrene beads with the guided light (up to 50% of intensity modulation) is then simulated and observed experimentally. We also showed that this multiphysics device can be used as a sensor, presenting curves of the intensity modulation depending on the concentration of beads. The attenuation in the optical signal varies between 2 and 5 dB with particle concentrations ranging from 136 to 455 beads per mu L in the analyte.

Remote sensing data acquisition using small UAVs equipped with multispectral sensors, provides high-resolution data without the need for destructive samples and can detect plant distress before visible symptoms appear. This study examines the impact of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) soil contamination on the development of maize plants using these types of data. The findings of this work highlight the usefulness of UAV-based multispectral analysis in predicting characteristic changes of the plants caused by soil changes, providing valuable information for improving environmental monitoring efficiency.

AB  - Background: Indocyanine green (ICG) imaging has been increasingly used for intraoperative guidance in colorectal surgery over the past decade. The aim of this study was to review and organize, according to different type of use, all available literature on ICG guided colorectal surgery and highlight areas in need of further research and discuss future perspectives. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched systematically through November 2022 for all available studies on fluorescence-guided surgery in colorectal surgery. Results: Available studies described ICG use in colorectal surgery for perfusion assessment, ureteral and urethral assessment, lymphatic mapping, and hepatic and peritoneal metastases assessment. Although the level of evidence is low, results are promising, especially in the role of ICG in reducing anastomotic leaks. Conclusions: ICG imaging is a safe and relatively cheap imaging modality in colorectal surgery, especially for perfusion assessment. Work is underway regarding its use in lymphatic mapping, ureter identification, and the assessment of intraperitoneal metastatic disease.

TI  - The Social Class Worldviews of Chinese International Students in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this qualitative study, we investigated the social class worldviews of Chinese International Students (CIS) in the United States. Social class worldviews are a constellation of beliefs, attitudes, and values that individuals use to maintain a sense of psychological equilibrium within their perceived social class groups and culture. Having interviewed eleven CIS in a midwestern city in the United States, the researchers found that their experiences reflected five themes: (a) social class consciousness; (b) social class socialization; (c) social class resources; (d) social class values; and (e) social class challenges. Suggestions for research and implications for higher education are discussed.

TI  - Low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and pan-immune-inflammation-value predict nodal pathologic complete response in 1274 breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a multicenter analysis
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Systemic inflammatory markers draw great interest as potential blood-based prognostic factors in several oncological settings.Objectives:The aim of this study is to evaluate whether neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) predict nodal pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in node-positive (cN+) breast cancer (BC) patients.Design:Clinically, cN+ BC patients undergoing NAC followed by breast and axillary surgery were enrolled in a multicentric study from 11 Breast Units.Methods:Pretreatment blood counts were collected for the analysis and used to calculate NLR and PIV. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate independent predictors of nodal pCR.Results:A total of 1274 cN+ BC patients were included. Nodal pCR was achieved in 586 (46%) patients. At multivariate analysis, low NLR [odds ratio (OR) = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51-0.98; p = 0.04] and low PIV (OR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.44-0.90; p = 0.01) were independently predictive of increased likelihood of nodal pCR. A sub-analysis on cN1 patients (n = 1075) confirmed the statistical significance of these variables. PIV was significantly associated with axillary pCR in estrogen receptor (ER)-/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+ (OR = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12-0.83; p = 0.02) and ER-/HER2- (OR = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17-0.97; p = 0.04) BC patients.Conclusion:This study found that low NLR and PIV levels predict axillary pCR in patients with BC undergoing NAC.Registration:Eudract number NCT05798806.

TI  - Quality of life of coffee growers in the high mountains of Veracruz, Mexico
T2  - AGRONOMIA MESOAMERICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The High Mountain Region (RHM) is the most productive and socioeconomic region for the coffee cultivation in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, and one of the most representative of the sector at the national level. Objective. To determine the quality of life (QL) from the objective and subjective point of view of the small coffee producers (SP) in RHM, Mexico. Materials and methods. One hundred and fifty semi-structured interviews were applied to producers in eleven municipalities located in: Comapa, Coscomatepec, Huatusco, Ixhuatlan del cafe, Sochiapa, Tenampa, Tomatlan, Totutla, Tlaltetela, Tlacotepec, and Zentla, during 2020. Descriptive statistics and trend measurements were obtained. Results. At objective level the QL was found to be low, but at the farmers' subjective level, it was determined to be acceptable. In the objective assessment, it was identified that the SP have minimal education (primary), the income is not adequate (they require activities outside the farm with an average net annual income of US $ 416 to US $ 1115), the cost of health has increased (due to the COVID-19 pandemic), and proper nutrition is lacking (19 to 25 meals per month). In the subjective assessment there is insecurity and distrust with the government authorities, however, the producers have adapted to living in adverse socioeconomic contexts, since they value community life, intra-family relationships and their environment (coffee growing), which could be influenced by their own worldview. Conclusion. With or without knowledge of the concept of quality, producers have developed a learned or acquired capacity, both individually and collectively to adapt to the environment. Objectively, the quality of life is considered low, however, the interviewees had a perception of satisfaction both individually and collectively.

TI  - Cultural Stereotypes and Their Reflection in Transnational Advertising br
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - An attempt was made in the article to analyze cultural stereotypes and their reflection in the advertising of Dove and Olay cosmetic brands. For the first time, stereotypes of beauty in Chinese, Russian and English video advertising of international companies are compared. On the example of transnational advertising, the ways of transmitting verbal information in a commercial message are studied, cultural differences in the perception of beauty stereotypes are revealed, their transformation is established, and new means of expression are described. A contradictory trend has been identified in marketing: on the one hand, international companies actively use national and cultural stereotypes, which allow creating an emotionally significant image in accordance with the ethno-cultural worldview of the consumer, paying attention to it, making a decision in the face of a large flow of information, on the other hand, they oppose standardization and stereotyping. Their role in the perception of the value of information has been established.

TI  - Integrating WSN and Laser SLAM for Mobile Robot Indoor Localization
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
M3  - Article
AB  - Localization plays a vital role in the mobile robot navigation system and is a fundamental capability for the following path planning task. In an indoor environment where the global positioning system signal fails or becomes weak, the wireless sensor network (WSN) or simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) scheme gradually becomes a research hot spot. WSN method uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values to determine the position of the target signal node, however, the orientation of the target node is not clear. Besides, the distance error is large when the indoor signal receives interference. The laser SLAM-based method usually uses a 2D laser Lidar to build an occupancy grid map, then locates the robot according to the known grid map. Unfortunately, this scheme only works effectively in those areas with salient geometrical features. The traditional particle filter always fails for areas with similar structures, such as a long corridor. To solve their shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel coarse-to-fine paradigm that uses WSN to assist mobile robot localization in a geometrically similar environment. Firstly, the fingerprints database is built in the offline stage to get reference distance information. The distance data is determined by the statistical mean value of multiple RSSI values. Secondly, a hybrid map with grid cells and RSSI values is constructed when the mobile robot moves from a starting point to the ending place. Thirdly, the RSSI values are thought of as a basic reference to get a coarse localization. Finally, an improved particle filtering method is presented to achieve fine localization. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is effective and robust for global localization. The localization success rate reaches 97.0% and the average moving distance is only 0.74 meters, while the traditional method always fails. In addition, the method also works well when the mobile robot is kidnapped to another position in the environment.

TI  - A Cloud Detection Method Based on Spectral and Gradient Features for SDGSAT-1 Multispectral Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the limited penetration of visible bands, optical remote sensing images are inevitably contaminated by clouds. Therefore, cloud detection or cloud mask products for optical image processing is a very important step. Compared with conventional optical remote sensing satellites (such as Landsat series and Sentinel-2), sustainable development science Satellite-1 (SDGSAT-1) multi-spectral imager (MII) lacks a short-wave infrared (SWIR) band that can be used to effectively distinguish cloud and snow. To solve the above problems, a cloud detection method based on spectral and gradient features (SGF) for SDGSAT-1 multispectral images is proposed in this paper. According to the differences in spectral features between cloud and other ground objects, the method combines four features, namely, brightness, normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and haze-optimized transformation (HOT) to distinguish cloud and most ground objects. Meanwhile, in order to adapt to different environments, the dynamic threshold using Otsu's method is adopted. In addition, it is worth mentioning that gradient features are used to distinguish cloud and snow in this paper. With the test of SDGSAT-1 multispectral images and comparison experiments, the results show that SGF has excellent performance. The overall accuracy of images with snow surface can reach 90.80%, and the overall accuracy of images with other surfaces is above 94%.

TI  - A Novel Semisupervised Contrastive Regression Framework for Forest Inventory Mapping With Multisensor Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of forests is critical for forest management and carbon stocks monitoring. Deep learning (DL) is becoming more popular in Earth observation (EO), however, the availability of reference data limits its potential in wide-area forest mapping. To overcome those limitations, here we introduce contrastive regression into EO-based forest mapping and develop a novel semisupervised regression framework for wall-to-wall mapping of continuous forest variables. It combines supervised contrastive regression loss (CtRL) and semi-supervised cross-pseudo regression (CPR) loss. The framework is demonstrated over a boreal forest site using Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery for mapping forest tree height. Achieved prediction accuracies are strongly better compared to using vanilla UNet or traditional regression models, with relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 15.1% on stand level. We expect that the developed framework can be used for modeling other forest variables and EO datasets.

TI  - Vegetational succession assessment in a fragment of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetational succession assessment is an important step for better management practices, providing relevant quantitative and qualitative information. With the advancements of remote sensing algorithms and access to data, land use and land cover (LULC) monitoring has become increasingly feasible and important for the evaluation of changes in the landscape at different spatial and temporal scales. This study aims to analyze the vegetation succession achieved by a project funded by the Brazilian Environmental Ministry (Ministerio do Meio Ambiente, in Portuguese) intended to recover degraded areas. A 2014 and a 2019 LULC map was generated using high-resolution (10 cm) images. Given the great challenge of classifying high-resolution images, three classification algorithms were compared. The techniques to regenerate degraded areas were efficient to increase arboreal vegetation area by more than 30% between 2014 and 2019. Land cover and land use change monitoring is of paramount importance to strengthen sustainable practices, especially in the highly threatened Atlantic Forest biome. This study also shows that funding opportunities are essential for projects that make such actions possible, including the present research and the analysis of environmental regeneration.

TI  - Burn severity evaluation in black pine forests with topographical factors using Sentinel-2 in Kastamonu, Turkiye
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Forest fires are one of the most important natural disasters all over the world in terms of the damage they cause to the ecosystem. Turkey is also exposed to wildfires damaging large areas of forests every year. Wildfires endanger the sustainability of forest resources and cause significant biological and ecological damage to the forests. It is crucial to estimate fire behaviour characteristics to take effective interventions in the fire events. Obtaining data based on terrestrial measurements is very expensive and very time-consuming to predict fire behaviour characteristics. The use of remote sensing technologies is therefore very useful since the satellite images will be faster, more sensitive, and economical to determine the burning severity and burning areas. Results: In this study, the forest fire that occurred in the Kastamonu-Taskopru district was analyzed with remote sensing techniques. The fire occurred in 2020 (06.09.2020). The fire satellite image was thus taken from the pre-fire period (26.08.2020) and post-fire period (13.10.2020). First of all, pre fire and post-fire Sentinel-2 images of fire areas were used to determine the burned area using NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio) and dNBR (Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio) indices. Also, burned area rate and burn severity were evaluated depending on the altitude, aspect, and slope factors. Conclusion: The total burned area was 1504.9 ha. The maps showed that the burned areas were covered by moderate-and high-severity classes. The forest fire was more severe in the altitude range from 1170 to 1370m, at 20-33% slope and northerly aspects in the burned area. The existence of extreme meteorological factors and the horizontal and vertical continuity of the forest fuels have been the main factors in the effect of the fire on large areas. Estimation of forest fire risk, taking into account extreme meteorological conditions and fuel properties, will have an important place in forest ecology and management.

TI  - Multisource Joint Representation Learning Fusion Classification for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisource remote sensing images provide complementary multidimensional information for reliable and accurate classification. However, gaps in imaging mechanisms result in heterogeneity between multiple source images. During fusion, this heterogeneity causes the generated multisource representations to be redundant and ignore discriminative unisource information, which significantly hampers the fusion classification performance. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel multisource joint representation learning method for remote sensing image fusion classification, termed multisource information bottleneck fusion network (MIBF-Net). Based on the information bottleneck principle, MIBF-Net uses mutual information constraints to effectively integrate multisource information, generating a comprehensive and nonredundant multisource representation. Specifically, MIBF-Net first introduces an attribution-driven noise adaptation layer to dynamically balance the speed of feature learning across sources for extracting discriminative unisource intrinsic information. Furthermore, a cross-source relationship encoding (CRE) module is designed to fully explore cross-source complex dependencies for enhancing the richness of fused representations. Finally, we design an information bottleneck fusion (IB-Fusion) module to fuse unisource semantic information and cross-source information while reducing redundancy. In particular, we use variational inference techniques to effectively address the mutual information optimization problem and provide theoretical derivations. Extensive experimental results on three heterogeneous multisource remote sensing data benchmarks show that the model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Algae Blooms on the Greenland Ice Sheet Detected Through Solar-Induced Fluorescence
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial algae blooms on the Greenland ice sheet darken the surface albedo, enhancing surface melt. Sentinel-3 data was the first to highlight the extent of these blooms, which are expected to become larger as climate changes. Here, we propose a novel use of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data from TROPOspheric monitoring instrument (TROPOMI) to confirm the Sentinel-based maps and extend the data to daily levels to understand year-to-year variations in algae blooms. We combine the SIF data with a random walker algorithm to identify algae-covered areas. The SIF-based maps are found to be highly correlated with the Sentinel-based ones. The extent and the timing of the algae bloom are consistent between 2018 and 2020. This work opens the door to a new, complementary method for the monitoring of algae blooms on ice sheets and improving our understanding of their impact on glacier melt rate.

TI  - Local and Global Spatial Information for Land Cover Semisupervised Classification of Complex Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Each of the three satellites constituting the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) provides compact polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (CP SAR) data. The complex CP data have similar properties to the complex quad polarimetric (QP) data provided by prior RADARSAT missions. In this article, a land cover classification method using spatial information is designed based on the statistical characteristics of the complex CP and QP SAR data. First, the local spatial dependency among pixels is captured by superpixels. Second, a graph is constructed on the superpixels to model the global spatial dependency among superpixels. The land cover classification image with land cover type labels is then estimated by propagating labels from the few labeled superpixels to the unlabeled superpixels. Classification of two RCM complex CP and QP scenes demonstrates that the proposed method, with few labeled pixels, provides much higher classification accuracy than methods that do not exploit global spatial dependency.

TI  - Deep learning modelling of long-term satellite remotely sensed data for low-temperature asphalt binder selection
T2  - INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study has focused on selecting the asphalt binder performance grade (PG) using remotely sensed (RS) data including MODIS (Aqua and Terra), ASTER and FLDAS products. Three models have been created based on multiple linear regression and deep learning and used to estimate the annual minimum air temperature on the surface of the road pavement, considering the Superpave specifications. Parameters of the models include land surface temperature, latitude, vegetation index, elevation, snow cover fraction, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, wind speed, and climate type. The PG selection has been performed according to the proposed and three identified conventional approaches and comparative analyses have clarified that the proposed method yields reliable results in estimating the asphalt binder performance temperature and is more accurate than conventional approaches in determining the PG. According to the results, the proposed RS-based approach has the potential to determine the PG accurately in 1 km resolution.

AB  - In this paper, a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model is implemented to retrieve the Plant Area Index (PAI) of wheat and canola. Backscatter information from Sentinel-1 dualpol GRD SAR data and in-situ measurements collected during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2016 (SMAPVEX16-MB) Manitoba campaign were used to calibrate and validate the proposed GPR model. A recently proposed pseudo scattering entropy, H-c derived from dual-pol GRD SAR data has been used along with backscatter information to investigate the improvement in retrieval accuracy. Including the pseudo entropy parameter in the feature, space showed an improvement of 4.28% and 3.66% in the correlation coefficient (rho) for wheat and canola respectively. Similarly, a decrease in nRMSE by 4% for wheat and 4.76% for canola was observed during PAI retrieval.

TI  - Superthermal electron?s effects on lump solitons structures in magnetized auroral plasma
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the considerations of the acknowledgements of the numerous space observations by satellites in the auroral plasma, astro-physics plasmas, spacecraft observations, various plasma models have been framed and revealed different interesting features, like elec-trostatic structures, solitary waves, double layers, supersolitons, etc. Soliton theory is a very efficient and competent way to describe nonlinear features. Using Viking satellite data in the auroral plasma, we have derived lump soliton solutions of the Kadomstev-Petviashvili (KP) equation by employing Hirota bilinear method. Due to its wide range of applications, the study of lump soliton is very attractive and important too. It has been shown that the lump solitons structures as well as in the one-dimensional form of lump soliton are varied with associated parameters in the auroral magnetized plasma. During the analysis of the features of the lump solitons, it is found that the system parameters play a pivotal role on the lump solitons structures.(c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Coastline and shoreline change assessment in sandy coasts based on machine learning models and high-resolution satellite images
T2  - VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes to the coastline or shoreline arise from the water's dynamic interaction with the land surface, which is triggered by ocean currents, waves, and winds. Various methods have been proposed to identify and monitor coastlines and shorelines, but their outcomes are uncertain. This study proposes indicators for identifying coastlines and shorelines in the fields and on the remote sensing data. Different pixel-and object-based machine learning (ML) models were built to automatically interpret coastlines and shorelines from high-resolution remote sensing images and monitor coastal erosion in Vietnam. Two pixel-based models using Random Forest and SVM structures and eight object-based models using U-Net, and U-Net3+ structures were trained. All models were trained using the high -resolution images gathered using Google Earth Pro as input data. The U-Net achieves the most remarkable performance of 98% with a loss function of 0.16 when utilizing an input-image size of 512x512.Object-based models have shown higher performance in analyzing coastlines and shorelines with linear and continuous structures than pixel-based models. Additionally, the coastline is appropriate to evaluate coastal erosion induced by the effect of sea-level rise during storms. At the same time, the shoreline is suited to observe seasonal tidal fluctuations or the instantaneous movements of current waves. Under the pressure of tourist development, the coasts in Danang and Quang Nam provinces have been eroded in the last 10 years. River and ocean currents also cause erosion in the southern Cua Dai estuary. In the future, the trained U-Net model can be used to monitor the changes in coastlines and shorelines worldwide.

TI  - A Trihedral Corner Reflector for Radar Altimeter Calibration
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A trihedral corner reflector has been used to evaluate the capability of passive reflectors to calibrate radar altimeters, such as the Poseidon-4 altimeter on board Sentinel-6A. The reflector location, placed on the top of a mountain ridge and about 4-km off-nadir of the Sentinel-6A subsatellite track, allows capturing echoed signals with a signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) around 40 dB when processing the received data with a fully-focused synthetic aperture radar (FF-SAR) algorithm. Results obtained show a range bias of 33.9 with 8.5 mm of standard deviation and datation bias of -2.3 mu s with a standard deviation of 1.8 mu s for the measurement campaign between September 2021 and April 2022. Such values are comparable to what is currently achieved by means of active transponders, and therefore, it is demonstrated that passive reflectors may be of interest to support radar altimeter regular calibration.

TI  - An Introduction to Islamic Literary Theory: A Conceptual Framework for High School Students
T2  - ISLAMIYYAT-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC STUDIES
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - This article is concerned with introducing a new analytical tool for high school students. Islamic literary theory uses an Islamic lens in the study and analysis of literature and cultural productions. It is an empowerment theory that seeks to provide morally-centric emancipatory perspectives grounded in the teachings of the Qur'an and authentic Sunnah. Empowerment theories are concerned with improving the human condition. Islamic literary theory attempts to do this through analyzing texts and discussing Islamic and common sense (fitra) solutions to determine how the human condition can be elevated personally, socially and spiritually. Islamic literary theory uses Islamic principles to critique cultural productions. It seeks to describe and analyze not only the ways in which certain literature reinforces the narrative of secularism and immorality but also how other literature promotes emancipatory and Islamocentric ideas that make the world a better place. It is concerned with exploring how personal, family and micro and macro social life confront problems and achieve transformation through offering insights based on Islam. The Islamic worldview rests on the notion that the individual is in a state of constant struggle from worldly encounters in which s/he must make a choice to act and speak morally and ethically in line with Qur'anic tenets to achieve success in the next life. Islamic literary theory in part critiques how individuals and groups are distracted from their true purpose in life. Texts are analyzed using the Qur'an and authentic hadith to discover in what ways individuals and groups freely, forgetfully or coercively commit wrongs against themselves and others. This paper discusses the emergence of Islamic literary theory as a critical lens for high school students. Furthermore, it discusses its historical foundation and purpose and it provides a conceptual framework for its application.

TI  - Modelling elephant corridors over two decades reveals opportunities for conserving connectivity across a large protected area network.
T2  - PloS one
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Protected area (PA) connectivity is pivotal for the persistence of wide-ranging wildlife species, but is challenged by habitat loss and fragmentation. We analyzed habitat suitability and connectivity for the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) across PAs in south-western Tanzania in 2000, 2010, and 2019. We quantified land-use changes through remote sensing data; estimated habitat suitability through aerial survey data, remotely sensed variables and ensemble species distribution models; modelled least-cost corridors; identified the relative importance of each corridor for the connectivity of the PA network and potential bottlenecks over time through circuit theory; and validated corridors through local ecological knowledge and ground wildlife surveys. From 2000 to 2019, cropland increased from 7% to 13% in the region, with an average expansion of 634 km2 per year. Distance from cropland influenced elephant distribution models the most. Despite cropland expansion, the locations of the modelled elephant corridors (n = 10) remained similar throughout the survey period. Based on local ecological knowledge, nine of the modelled corridors were active, whereas one modelled corridor had been inactive since the 1970s. Based on circuit theory, we prioritize three corridors for PA connectivity. Key indicators of corridor quality varied over time, whereas elephant movement through some corridors appears to have become costlier over time. Our results suggest that, over the past two decades, functional connectivity across the surveyed landscape has largely persisted. Beyond providing crucial information for spatial prioritization of conservation actions, our approach highlights the importance of modeling functional connectivity over time and verifying corridor models with ground-truthed data.

AB  - SAR Satellite monitoring is an interesting alternative to traditional Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques since it does not require the installation of sensors and enables the collection of data on a large spatial scale. The data collected by satellites are processed to obtain time histories of displacements through which phenomena such as settlements at the base of a structure can be identified and followed over time.This article provides a general overview of SAR satellite monitoring of structures and infrastructures, with a specific focus on DInSAR techniques ("Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar"). A data processing technique is presented to analyze DInSAR displacements to gain insight into the structural behavior. The case study investigated in this paper is the Palatino bridge in Rome, Italy. The SAR satellite data are acquired by COSMO-SkyMed of the Italian Space Agency and consist of displacements calculated during an acquisition period between 2010 and 2019. SAR satellite data allows to study the structural behavior in the vertical and longitudinal (i.e., along the bridge axis) directions. The effect of temperature on the bridge behavior is investigated.

AB  - Landslides are critical natural hazards whose frequency and severity are increasing due to climate change and human activities. The consequences of landslides are severe and can lead to the destruction of homes, infrastructures and the contamination of water supplies, with severe impact also on the local ecosystems and the disruption of natural habitats. This article examines the application of an ad-hoc neural network-based intelligent system to evaluate the landslide susceptibility of the terrain on the basis of satellite data. The proposed system is validated on data from Lombardia and Abruzzo, two Italian regions that have been particularly subject to the landslide phenomenon. Results indicate that the CNN model is able to correctly identify landslide occurrences with high accuracy, demonstrating that CNNs are capable of providing accurate susceptibility mapping at a local scale and surpassing the performance of existing solutions available in the literature.

TI  - Conditions on the Bedrock and Surface of the Vavilov Ice Cap (Severnaya Zemlya) During its Surge According To Airborne Radar Data
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - The glacier surge at Vavilov Ice Cap, Severnaya Zemlya, Russia (79 degrees 18 ' N, 94 degrees 40 ' E) began as early as the mid-1960s with a slow advance of its margin in the western part. Since 2012, the advance switched to the phase of catastrophic movement, which reached its climax in 2016, when the glacier velocity reached 9.2 km a-1. An ice fan with an area of about 140 km2 advanced into the Kara Sea water area 11 km from the shore, and a strongly crevassed ice stream was formed in the ice cap itself, which continues to move now with speeds of about 2 km a-1. The dynamic instability of Vavilov Ice Cap can be triggered by changes in basal conditions, which are still poorly known. In this study, we used airborne radio-echo sounding data acquired in September 2014 over the ice cap to characterize its surface and bedrock conditions. Based on the delay time and reflection amplitudes, the power reflection coefficient (PRC) from glacier surface and bedrock was estimated. For its calibration, we used the amplitude of reflections from the sea surface registered from different altitudes. The bedrock PRC values were converted to dielectric permittivity and compared with the glacier surface velocities in 2014 obtained from Landsat-7 images. We found a high positive correlation between the bedrock PRCs and velocities in the area with glacier speed higher than 1000 m a-1. In this area, the PRC is 20 dB higher than in the neighboring slower moving areas. Such a difference may be because the ice stream advanced on marine loose sediments with higher dielectric permittivity and conductivity and a higher reflection coefficient. The range of estimated bedrock PRCs corresponds to bed materials with relative dielectric permittivity from 5 to 10 and electrical conductivity from 10-5 to 10-2 Sm m-1.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGY-JOURNAL OF THE HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the event perception is a relatively young, but rapidly developing field of cognitive psychology, which is based on an integrative view of the process of human perception and the cognitive underpinnings of this process. The objective of the study was to identi-fy the specifics of the division of the visual narrative into events by preschoolers, primary school students, high school students and adults, and, based on the obtained data, to recon-struct hypothetically and compare the event models that each of these groups relies on. Wallace Chafe's Pear Film was used as a stimulus material. It is shown that the models of events constructed by preschoolers and primary school stu-dents, are "planar" in nature, while high school students and adults are charac-terized by "volumetric" models. It is also shown that the division of the narrative into events by high school students has no notable difference from that of adults, i.e. the key age for the transition from "planar" to "volumetric" models is a high school age. In addition, for primary school students, a correlation was found between event perception and other cognitive and communication skills. The strongest correlation was found between event perception and the minuteness of the retelling, which provides some evi-dence for the thesis about the domi-nance of "planar" models for primary school students. In addition, the results obtained were considered from the per-spective of the theory of mind also taken in the aspect of cognitive development.

AB  - The paper presents the ideological connections between Joseph Conrad's and Gilbert Keith Chesterton's output and between social-political activities of the two figures. Regardless of a manifest worldview discrepancy (Conrad's agnosticism versus Chesterton's Christian fideism), a strong spiritual link can be found between the writers. Their works are marked by interest in the man-deliberate and morally responsible creative subject, thus personalistic anthropological assumptions, while in journalism they shared devotion to modernly understood Latin tradition seen as a fundament of European civilisation. The two writers were distinguished by antiutopian sensitivity and sophisticated criticism of technocratic ideas of social reforms developed in the Fabian Society. As regards political issues, they sup- ported the Poles' aspirations to independence. Critically speaking about pan-Germanic militarism and about the Zionistic politics led upon alliance contracted with Germany at the expense of Poland, they forcibly wrote about destructive impact of Bolshevism and communism.

TI  - Combining Hyperspectral, LiDAR, and Forestry Data to Characterize Riparian Forests along Age and Hydrological Gradients
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian forests are complex ecosystems shaped by their connectivity to a river system, which produces a mosaic of ages and species. Because of increasing anthropic pressure from factors such as damming or climate change, they are often endangered and suffer from a drop in groundwater accessibility and increased water stress. By combining hyperspectral, LiDAR, and forestry datasets along a 20 km corridor of the Ain River, this paper assesses the ability of remote sensing to characterize and monitor such environments. These datasets are used to investigate changes in site conditions and forest characteristics, such as height and canopy water content, along a gradient of ecosystem ages and for reaches under distinct geomorphic conditions (shifting, sediment-starved, incised). The data show that, over time, forest patches aggrade, and the forest grows and becomes more post-pioneer. However, forest patches that are located in the incised reach aggrade more and appear to be less developed in height, more stressed, and feature species compositions reflecting dryer conditions, in comparison with better-connected patches of the same age. Random forest analysis was applied to predict the indicators of forest connectivity with remotely sensed LIDAR and hyperspectral data, in order to identify the spatial trends at the reach scale and compare them with the geomorphic segmentation of the river. The random forest classifications achieved an accuracy between 80% and 90% and resulted in spatial trends that highlighted the differences in hydrological connectivity between differing geomorphic conditions. Overall, remote sensing appears to be a good tool for characterizing the impact of channel incisions and adjustments on riparian forest conditions by identifying the locations of dryer forest patches. In addition, good accuracy was achieved when attempting to classify these forest patches, even when using hyperspectral data alone, which suggests that satellite data could become a powerful tool for monitoring the health of riparian forests, in the context of increasing anthropic pressures.

AB  - Most current 3D city models, created automatically from cadastral and remote sensing data and represented in CityGML, do not include roof overhangs, although these overhangs are very characteristic for the appearance of buildings. This paper describes an algorithm that procedurally adds such overhangs. When a CityGML model is textured, the size of the overhangs is determined by recognizing overhangs in facade textures. In this case, the method only needs an already existing model in CityGML representation. Alternatively, if an additional point cloud (e.g., from airborne laser scanning) is available, this cloud can be utilized to calculate the overhang sizes. We compare the results of both methods.

TI  - OBJECT-BASED MAPPING AND CLASSIFICATION FEATURES FOR TROPICAL HIGHLANDS USING SENTINEL-1, SENTINEL-2, AND GEDI CANOPY HEIGHT DATA- A CASE STUDY OF THE MURINGATO CATCHMENT, KENYA
T2  - ERDKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical highlands remain a challenging target for remote sensing due to their high heterogeneity of the land- scape and frequent cloud cover, causing a shortage of high-quality and reliable comprehensive data on land use and land cover on a local or regional scale. These, however, are urgently needed by local stakeholders and decisionmakers. This applies for example to the Muringato sub-catchment in Nyeri County, Kenya, where acute water problems have been identified to be usually directly related to specific land use and land cover. This article contributes to the understanding of tropical high- lands from a remote sensing perspective by examining Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Global Forest Canopy Height Model data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation, all provided by the Google Earth Engine. To do so, we assess classifiers derived from these datasets for different land cover types, analyzing the performance of promising candidates identified in the literature, using 2,800 samples extracted from high-resolution image data across Nyeri County. We also propose an object-based classification strategy based on sequential masking. This strategy is adapted to very heterogeneous landscapes by refining image objects after re-evaluating their homogeneity. Small buildings, which constitute a significant part of the set- tlement structure in the area, are particularly difficult to detect. To improve the recognition of these objects we additionally consider the local contrast of the relevant classifier to identify potential candidates. Evaluating our sample data, we found that especially optical indices like the Sentinel Water Index, the Enhanced Normalized Difference Impervious Surfaces Index or specific Sentinel-2 bands combined with canopy height data are promising for water, built-up or tree cover detec- tion. With these findings, our proposed object-based classification approach is applied to the Muringato sub-catchment as a representative example of the Kenyan tropical highland region. We achieve a classification accuracy of approximately 88% in the Muringato sub-catchment, outperforming existing products available for the study area. The knowledge gained in the study will also be used for future remote sensing-based monitoring of the region.

AB  - University mathematics education and civic education through mathematics emphasise different aspects of the mathematical worldview. The present study qualitatively analyses 21 mathematics students' mathematics-specific intrinsic motivation for choosing a mathematics study programme referring to different aspects of their mathematical worldview before the beginning of their study. The results show that many preservice teachers enjoy schematic aspects of mathematics, which does neither correspond to the type of mathematics taught at universities nor to civic education through mathematics. These findings contribute to explaining demotivation and frustration of preservice teachers with university mathematics as well as challenges for implementing civic education through mathematics in classrooms.

TI  - Mapping overwintering grain stubbles using machine-learning methods and image compositions for common agriculture policy-control and water framework directive connected activities
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - By leaving grain stubble on the field over the winter, farmers can actively contribute to nature conservation. Animals receive food and living space in these areas, endangered herbs too, but at the same time, it is reducing the input of substances into water and function as covered ground to protect the fertile soil from erosion. Remote sensing can deliver information on this type of land cover, which is also important for the agricultural administration. The farmer can be compensated by the government to let stubbles on the fields. The results of this study show that there is a high potential to detect overwintering stubbles fields area for common agriculture policy (CAP)-control to verify agricultural funding with Support Vector Machine (96.5%) by combining remote sensing classification methods with geodata analysis techniques using geoinformation systems (GIS), negative buffering (-20 m), and using threshold settings for correct classified pixel per field. These results give occasion for optimism for the further processing of this land cover by using it as an application for the government to support CAP- and water framework directive-activities.

TI  - Detecting Urban Floods with Small and Large Scale Analysis of ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When a large-scale flood disaster occurs, it is important to identify the flood areas in a short time in order to effectively support the affected areas afterwards. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is promising for flood detection. A number of change detection methods have been proposed to detect flooded areas with pre- and post-event SAR data. However, it remains difficult to detect flooded areas in built-up areas due to the complicated scattering of microwaves. To solve this issue, in this paper we propose the idea of analyzing the local changes in pre- and post-event SAR data as well as the larger-scale changes, which may improve accuracy for detecting floods in built-up areas. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of multi-scale SAR analysis for flood detection in built-up areas using ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data. First, several features were determined by calculating standard deviation images, difference images, and correlation coefficient images with several sizes of kernels. Then, segmentation on both small and large scales was applied to the correlation coefficient image and calculated explanatory variables with the features at each segment. Finally, machine learning models were tested for their flood detection performance in built-up areas by comparing a small-scale approach and multi-scale approach. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to validate the model, showing that highest accuracy was offered by the AdaBoost model, which improved the F1 Score from 0.89 in the small-scale analysis to 0.98 in the multi-scale analysis. The main contribution of this manuscript is that, from our results, it can be inferred that multi-scale analysis shows better performance in the quantitative detection of floods in built-up areas.

TI  - Herd Size Dynamics and Observations on the Natural History of Dugongs<i> (Dugong</i><i> dugon)</i> in the Andaman Islands, India
T2  - AQUATIC MAMMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last four decades, dugong (Dugong dugon) aggregations have been rarely reported from the geographically isolated, vast seascape of the Andaman Islands, India. The Indian Ocean tsu-nami of 2004, hunting, coastal development, and habitat loss are the major causes of this change in the social system of dugongs in the Andaman Islands. Our long-term monitoring study (2017 to 2022) reveals a changing trend in aggregating behaviour of dugongs. In an inclusive, collab-orative effort, we engaged multiple stakeholders using two approaches: (1) creating a spatially spread citizen science network targeting sea-faring agencies-the fishers, forest department, SCUBA divers, and defence bodies (Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard); and (2) conducting standard-ized questionnaire surveys (UNEP/CMS) with fishers. Our approach yielded reports of 63 herd sightings of dugongs from the Andaman archipel-ago. The fishers reported 73.01% of the sightings, followed by the defence bodies (20.63%), forest department (3.18%), and SCUBA divers (3.18%). Smaller herds in our study comprised three to six individuals, with a social structure of "adults only" and "adult-calf." The larger herds of seven to 13 individuals included an "adult-calf" combi-nation with a greater number of adults accompa-nying two to three calves. More than 95% of these herd occurrences were reported from sheltered, coastal waters with resource concentrations (large seagrass meadows). Further, we present novel dugong occurrence reports from data-deficient regions like the Jarawa Tribal Reserve and the North Sentinel Island, along with dugong occur-rences from Little Andaman, where the population was speculated to be locally extinct after the 2004 tsunami. These findings strongly advocate the involvement of multiple stakeholders as a cost-effective approach to monitoring the distribution and population of dugongs in larger seascapes like the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Moreover, such an approach would be critical for sensitizing the local stakeholders regarding the conservation and management of large marine mammals such as dugongs.

TI  - "Cartesian Platonism" by Henry More and His Correspondence with Rene Descartes (1648-1649)
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to study the problem of Descartes' early influence on the English philosophy of the 17th century. Henry More (1614-1687), a young Cambridge lecturer proved to become later the recognized head of the Cambridge Platonic School. He began teaching R. Descartes' mechanical philosophy at Christ's College in the mid 40s, and his views appeared to be among the earliest sources of the Cartesians' spread in Britain. At this time, the main importance for clarifying the nature of More's "Cartesianism" was his exchange of letters with Descartes. Unfortunately, the letters of the English philosopher are only partially known in Russian studies. The article introduces the reader to the historical circumstances of the formation of the Cambridge School and its scientific "Constellations", the early evolution of H. More's worldview towards Cartesianism and the emergence of contradictions, which More calls "difficulties in reading Descartes". In this article, we examine the first of More's letters to Descartes from a new angle, namely, in connection with More's own theology of the late 40s - early 50s of the 17th century. The results of the study show the key idea of H. More's philosophy that is an attempt to synthesize classical Neoplatonism and the philosophy of Descartes.

TI  - SAR Imaging in Frequency Scan Mode: System Optimization and Potentials for Data Volume Reduction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequency scanning (FScan) is an innovative acquisition mode for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. The method is based on the frequency-dependent beam pointing capabilities of phased array antennas, artificially increased via the combined use of true time delays and phase shifters within the array antenna. By this, typical limitations of conventional SAR systems in terms of achievable swath width and azimuth resolution can be mitigated, and so a wide swath can be imaged maintaining a fine azimuthal resolution. In the first part of the article, we introduce the theoretical concept, which is necessary to evaluate the reduced echo window length (EWL) with respect to equivalent stripmap data and the implications for the transmit pulse characterization. An FScan sensor flying in a TerraSAR-X-like orbit is shown to be capable of imaging an 80-km wide swath with 1-m azimuth resolution. The resulting time-frequency properties of the recorded raw data make the traditional SAR data compression algorithms such as block-adaptive quantization (BAQ) highly inefficient in this case. Therefore, the second part of the article investigates dedicated quantization methods for efficient data volume reduction in FScan systems. Different solutions are investigated and evaluated through simulations. Various transformations of the raw data have been exploited to optimize the encoding process, including deramping, fast Fourier transform (FFT), and blockwise approaches. Compared with standard BAQ in the time domain, the suggested data compression methods significantly improve the resulting signal-to-quantization noise ratio, allowing for the reduction in the overall data volume by about 60% for the considered system scenario, while maintaining robustness in the presence of inhomogeneous scene characteristics at the cost of a modest complexity increase for its on-board implementation.

TI  - Seasonal variation in the reproductive and larval performance of the winged pearl oyster <i>Pteria sterna</i> associated with anomalous environmental conditions
T2  - CIENCIAS MARINAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The reproductive and larval performance of Pteria sterna associated with anomalous environmental factors was evaluated, testing the hypothesis that the transition from La Nina to El Nino in 2008-2009 affected the "normal" periods in which ripe broodstock are collected and larvae are reared in a hatchery. Seasonal sampling included 2 reproductive periods (February and April 2009), 1 pre-reproductive period (November 2008), and 1 post-reproductive period (June 2009). Of the 40 oysters collected in each period, 20 were used for induced spawning and larval culture, while 20 were used to evaluate indices of reproductive performance. Water temperature, salinity, and seston content were monitored in each period. Sea surface temperature (SST) data associated with anomalous environmental conditions were obtained from the Aqua-MODIS satellite. Variations in SST affected reproductive performance more than larval performance in Pteria sterna. Spawning induc-tion failed in November 2008 and succeeded in February, April, and June 2009, although only the larvae from April completed metamorphosis and settled, given the riper broodstock, larger oocytes, and favorable environmental conditions (21.80 degrees C; 31 mg center dot L-1 total seston; +0.50 degrees C SST). Positive SST anomalies (+0.50 to +1.10 degrees C) from August to December 2008 resulted in longer summer conditions that affected spawning in February 2009. In June 2009 (22.50 degrees C; 29.50 mg center dot L-1 total seston; +0.40 degrees C SST), when the percentages of ripe gonads and mature oocytes were small, the larvae were not viable, and few spat settled. In addition to collecting ripe broodstock in winter-spring for optimal larval and spat viability, we recommend including a brief conditioning period at the hatchery following the spawning peak and a second conditioning period in late autumn to promote nutrient recycling and natural gamete recovery.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth and Space - From Infrared to Terahertz (ESIT)

AB  - The thermal drainage of coastal power plants have adversely affect the ecological environment in the nearby sea area. Thermal infrared remote sensing data has the characteristics of macroscopic and periodic revisiting, and has certain advantages in monitoring the sea surface temperature and the thermal drainage of coastal power plants.FY-3D MERSI-2 thermal infrared channel data has 250m spatial resolution and once a day revisit cycle, it has potential application value in the sea surface temperature monitoring. In the construction of sea surface temperature retrieval model, it is necessary to deal with all kinds of data needed for the construction of the experiment, including atmospheric profile data set, emissivity data, spectral response information, ocean station data, MODTRAN atmospheric radiation transmission simulation model data, etc., to meet the needs of the experimental process. A high-precision model temperature retrieval model based on split window algorithm is constructed by using FY-3D MERSI-2 thermal infrared channel data. It is used to retrieve the sea surface temperature in the waters near Fuqing nuclear power plant and analyze the environmental application problems such as the diffusion trend, temperature change trend, the form of thermal drainage and the distribution of temperature rise zone. Firstly, the FY-3D MERSI-2 data is subjected to geometric correction with the Geographic Lookup Table(GLT),and radiation correction to obtain the image brightness temperature data. Then, the sea surface temperature is retrieved according to the established model, and it is matched with the thermal infrared data of Infrared Multi-spectral Imager of Gaofen-5 (GF-5 VIMS), with a spatial resolution of 40m in spectrum and geometry. Finally, the retrieval results of the two images on the same day are compared. The retrieval results are verified by the measured data, and compared with the retrieval results of the traditional split window algorithm retrieval models. The results show that: Based on the split window algorithm, the sea surface temperature retrieval model established by adding two thermal infrared channel temperature difference terms is better than 1.7K in accuracy. Because of its high frequency of time revisiting, the MERSI-2 data can monitor the distribution of temperature and drainage in different seasons and tidal levels. According to the statistics of base temperature, temperature rise area, tide and temperature rise diagram of FY-3D MERSI-2, it can realize ideal spatial distribution monitoring of warm water and drainage. According to the form of warm drainage, the monitoring results of GF-5 VIMS are relatively fine. After being discharged through the water outlet of the sewage pipe, due to the influence of the instantaneous sea surface wind direction and wind speed, it will be discharged to the southeast, and its diffuse shape is obvious. For small-scale power plants, it is suggested to combine the thermal infrared remote sensing data with high spatial resolution to improve the monitoring accuracy of time frequency and diffusion details distribution of thermal drainage in power plants. In the future research, if there are conditions to measure or collect more relevant environmental data, such as sea surface wind direction record, sea area circulation record, etc., there will be more beneficial to further analyze the distribution and change of temperature and drainage in the study area.

TI  - Long-Term Shoreline and Islands Change Detection with Digital Shoreline Analysis Using RS Data and GIS
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study concerned the assessment of changes in the coastline of Kavvayi beach and its nine islands in a tropical coastal wetland using remote sensing (RS) data and geographic information systems (GIS), as this sedimentary environment is still poorly characterized. The satellite data used were from LANDSAT images (30 m spatial resolution) (MSS-volume 5, TM, ETM, and ETM+ volume 6) for the period of the last 25 years (1990 to 2014). Band 5 in Landsat (MSS) and band 6 (ETM 24- OLI) were used because they clearly distinguish the boundaries between land and water. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) was used to understand shoreline changes such as erosion and accretion processes by calculating the net shift in shoreline (NSM), end point rate (EPR), and linear regression rate (LRR) for the period of 25 years. The results showed significant changes over the studied period, leading to erosion and accretion. Coastal processes had an impact in the period from 2005 to 2014, leading to the development of a new island in the northern part of the wetland due to the construction of a new breakwater. In addition, the causes of the shoreline changes on the islands, including anomalies and the formation of new structures in the wetland, were investigated and discussed. These analyses confirmed that the islands studied were subjected to marine transgression and vice versa. Among this, Kavvayi was subject to marine transgression over the period, and Achanthurti Island showed erosion to a lesser extent. This can be considered as a feature of wetlands in combating sea level rise at local levels and possible reasons for the changes along with the coastal zone management plans were also discussed.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies the issues of the naming of God: is it possible to name God, how the name and the named are connected, does God have his own name, is the formula "the name of God is God" acceptable for the Christian worldview? The answers to these questions are given in the article using two methods, i.e. apophatic and antinomic. The objectives of the study are as follows. Firstly, to clarify the church's view on the phenomenon of the name of God; secondly, to compare the two ways of this clarifi cation, designated as apophatic and antinomic. The basis for understanding apophatic theology is the writings of the Corpus Areopagiticum, where apophatism can be regarded to be a condition of spiritual vision and mystical theology, as well an intellectual cognitive path. The principle of the non-mergence and inseparability of the name and the named are seen as the result of the apophatic approach in the article. This principle, applied by Russian religious philosophers to express the connection of God and His name, is found in works by Priest Pavel Florensky, but his philosophy is associated by researchers primarily with the antinomic method. The non-mergence and inseparability of the name and the named in the antinomic reading acquires the paradoxical character of two mutually excluding statements about the divinity and non-divinity of the name of God. As an antinomy are also regarded statements made at the same time and in the same relation, about the presence and absence of God's own name. Among the conclusions of the article is the theological acceptability of the statement that "the name of God is God".

The Cheyiping landslide, located in western Yunnan Province, China, added many cracks and dislocations to the surface of the slope due to the severe seasonal rainfall and rise of the water level, which seriously threaten the safety of residents and roads located on the body and foot of the slope. To investigate the movement of the landslide, this paper used Sentinel-1A SAR data processed by time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology to monitor the long-time surface deformation. The landslide boundary was defined, then the spatial distribution of landslide surface deformation from 5 January 2018 to 27 December 2021 was obtained. According to the monthly rainfall data and the temporal deformation results, the movement of the landslide was highly correlated with seasonal rainfall, and the Cheyiping landslide underwent seasonal sectional accelerated deformation. Moreover, the water level change of the Lancang River caused by the water storage of the hydropower station and seasonal rainfall accelerates the deformation of the landslide. This case study contributes to the interpretation of the slow deformation mechanism of the Cheyiping landslide and early hazard warning.

TI  - Anopheles stephensi: The emerging vector of malaria in the Republic of Djibouti, Horn of Africa.
T2  - International Journal of Biosciences
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigated mosquito species composition and phenotypic insecticide resistance profile to support decision-making in vector control in the Republic of Djibouti at the Horn of Africa. Adult mosquitoes were collected between December 2016 and December 2017 across 20 sentinel sites established in the 6 regions of the country using both Centers for Disease Control (CDC) miniature light traps and pyrethrum spray catches (PSC). Female mosquitoes were kept aside, for morphological identification to species by an expert entomologist using appropriate taxonomic keys by Gillies & Coetzee and Glick. Bioassays were also conducted in An. stephensi from Djibouti-ville against nine insecticides used in public health. A total number of 12,538 host-seeking mosquitoes belonging to four genera (Anopheles, Culex, Aedes, Uranotaenia) comprising 12 species were collected. Among these, A. gambiae S.L. and A. stephensi were the two major malaria vectors identified while secondary malaria vectors such as A. nili somalicus, A. dthali and A. azaniae were also collected. Culex quinquefasciatus was the most abundant mosquito species in the 6 regions. WHO susceptibility tests performed on A. stephensi population from Djibouti-ville showed resistance to pyrethroids, organophosphates, carbamates and DDT. The resistance intensity bioassays indicated low to moderate intensity of resistance with pyrethroid insecticides and the organophosphate pirimiphos methyl. Meanwhile pre-exposure to PBO suggested involvement of P450 detoxification enzymes in pyrethroid resistance. These findings revealed the urgent need to develop and implement a programme for monitoring and managing insecticide resistance in local vector populations with efficient control strategies in Djibouti.

TI  - Propagating Sentinel-2 Top-of-Atmosphere Radiometric Uncertainty Into Land Surface Phenology Metrics Using a Monte Carlo Framework
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of optical imagery allow one to derive land surface phenology metrics. These metrics are only complete with a statement about their uncertainty. A source of uncertainty is the radiometry of the sensor. We propagated radiometric uncertainties within a Monte Carlo framework into phenological metrics using the TIMESAT approach based on time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), three-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and green leaf area index (GLAI) derived from radiative transfer modeling. In addition, we studied the effect of propagated uncertainties on scene preclassification. We focused on Sentinel-2 multispectral imager top-of-atmosphere data since quantitative estimates of radiometric uncertainties are available. Propagation was carried out for a growing season over an agricultural region in Switzerland. Propagated uncertainties had little impact on the classification except for spectrally mixed pixels. Effects on the spectral indices and GLAI were more pronounced. In detail, the GLAI was more uncertain due to the ill-posedness of radiative transfer model inversion (median relative uncertainty for all crop pixels and Sentinel-2 scenes: 4.4%) than EVI (2.7%) and NDVI (1.1%). Regarding phenology, metrics exhibited largest uncertainties in the case of GLAI. The magnitude of uncertainty in the metrics depends on the interscene error correlation, which we assumed to be either zero (uncorrelated) or one (fully correlated) since the actual correlation is unknown. If uncertainties are fully correlated, uncertainties in metrics are small (two to three days) but take values up to greater ten days under the uncorrelated assumption. Thus, our work provides guidance for the interpretation of phenological metrics.

TI  - Morphometric study to determine morphological alignments in the Mayar? area, Cuba
T2  - BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD GEOLOGICA MEXICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geomorphological Map of the Republic of Cuba at a scale of 1: 100 000, is one of the proj-ects developed by the country to increase the degree of geological knowledge and optimize the use of natural resources and conditions. The map is made up of several topographic sheets, among them is Mayari 5077; it has a high geological-structural complexity, which makes it necessary to deepen its morphotectonic knowledge. For this, the identification and characterization of morphoalignments is carried out, based on morphometric methods, analysis of the surface drainage network and photointerpretation. The lineaments were extracted in the Geographic Information System QGIS v3.16, these were superimposed and correlated to obtain a final Map. The number, length, orientation and density of mor-phoalignments were determined. As a result, 249 lineaments were identified with an average length of 1422 m, predominant orientation N 40 degrees -50 degrees E and secondary N 50 degrees -60 degrees E, associated with nor-mal lateral faults, belonging to the main fracturing system in the region, the Nipe direction (NE -SW). In addition, the analysis of its density made it possi-ble to define that the northwest slopes of the Sierra de Nipe, and the articulation zone of this mountainous group with the Sierra Cristal, constituting the areas of greatest tectonic weakness, marked by linear ele-ments, preferably diagonal, which follow the orienta-tion of faults and limits of morphostructures. The genesis of the relief of the study area is conditioned by tectonic structures, which have directly influenced the intensity of the exogenetic activity.

TI  - Spirituality Factor in the Professional Ideology of a Modern Journalist: On the Issue of Cultural Memory
T2  - THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES OF JOURNALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - In the modern world of global information and psychological warfare the problem of preserving traditional values of Russia is acute. Spiri-tuality as a factor of human formation in the profession remains a priority in the sphere of scientific research. The purpose of the research is to character-ize the construct of & DLANGBRAC;spirituality & drangbrac; as the basic foundation of a journalist's pro-fessional ideology; using the results of the journalists' survey; to identify and analyze the key frames of the spirituality of a journalist, affecting the ideals and strategies of his work. The research has been conducted in 2022 and in-cluded two stages: a survey of journalists in various cities of Russia and a per-sonal questionnaire survey of students of the St. Petersburg and Transbaikal State universities, who study journalism. As a result, 319 questionnaires have been processed. The research is carried out within the framework of cognitive linguistics and psychology, taking into account the position of the unified pro-cess of perception, processing and transmission of information. The authors have relied on the sociocultural approach and linguocultural analysis, empha-sizing the integrative potential of the mass media in transmitting the values of society. Content analysis and associative experiment are used to identify the constructs of the national worldview. Spirituality is an integral component of the personality of a professional. It is directly related to the sociocode of the native culture, awakens national identification and in its orientation to-wards the common good can help in resisting an aggressive environment. The results of the study have shown concern among media workers and fu-ture journalists about the number and quality of publications on spiritual and moral issues. A lack of materials on the values of the family and society as a whole is stressed. Most journalists in the list of their work priorities give ac-cent to reliance on the meanings and values of the event, the possibility of self-knowledge, the predominance of the spiritual over the material. Amongthe key frames of the axiological model of & DLANGBRAC;spirituality & drangbrac; are named the follow- ing ones: Responsibility, Truth, Hard work, Love, Help, etc. Nevertheless, the fragmentary loss of journalists' moral guidelines due to the multipluralism of moral matrices and transformation of professional skills is noted.

AB  - One of the Strategic Objectives of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) is to develop agile, scalable ground capabilities to improve efficiency of service deliverables and ingest of satellite observation data from a broad variety of internal and external sources. In addition to the NESDIS Ground Enterprise Study, which examines the feasibility of various approaches to achieve these Strategic Objectives, NESDIS is also performing ongoing market research such as Requests for Information (RFIs), Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), and Vendor Demonstrations to understand potential on-ramps to more rapidly achieve a ground enterprise architecture that meets this Strategic Objective. In the case of satellite operations, an envisioned future ground enterprise would heavily exploit new cloud-based technologies, capabilities, and resources. Specific study goals include the ability for cloud solutions to enable command and control across several constellations, rapid integration of new satellites and new missions, as well as developing specialized applications in support of new satellites/missions in cloud-based environments.In this paper, we will first present a summary of the most feasible cloud-based enterprise ground system applications identified from the NESDIS Ground Enterprise Study along with the various NESDIS market research activities. We will further identify and provide a description of the most cost-effective alternatives and capabilities in support of satellite operations to date, and how these could impact satellite operations. We will assess the ability to evolve existing systems to incorporate the recommendations of these research activities, consider the use of services-based approaches, and address the system maintainability process with respect to the alternatives under consideration. We will describe specific scenarios under the future enterprise architecture that would enhance existing functionality and how recent market research potentially either increases and or decreases near-term viability of specific NESDIS near-term objectives. We will also critically analyze the feasibility of cloud-based satellite operations capabilities from a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations perspective, in order to address the impact of a given alternative on NOAA operations staff. Finally, we will identify any lessons learned gleaned from the various cloud-based market research activities and their effects on future LEO ground system alternatives.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize transitions to acute and residential care and identify variables associated with specific transitions among community-based persons living with dementia (PLWD).DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using primary care electronic medical record data linked with health administrative data.SETTING: Alberta.PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 65 years or older living in the community who had been diagnosed with dementia and who saw a Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network contributor between January 1, 2013, and February 28, 2015.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All emergency department visits, hospitalizations, residential care (supportive living and long-term care) admissions, and deaths within a 2-year follow-up period.RESULTS: In total, 576 PLWD were identified who had a mean (SD) age of 80.4 (7.7) years; 55% were female. In 2 years, 423 (73.4%) had at least 1 transition and, of these, 111 (26.2%) had 6 or more. Emergency department visits, including multiple visits, were common (71.4% had ≥1, 12.1% had ≥4). Of those hospitalized (43.8%), nearly all were admitted from the emergency department; the average (SD) length of stay was 23.6 (35.8) days, and 32.9% had at least 1 alternate level of care day. In total, 19.3% entered residential care, most admitted from hospital. Those admitted to hospital and those admitted to residential care were older and had greater historical health system use, including home care. One-quarter of the sample did not have any transitions (or die) during follow-up; they were typically younger and had limited historical health system use.CONCLUSION: Older PLWD experienced frequent, and frequently compound, transitions that have implications for them, their family members, and the health system. There was also a large proportion without transitions suggesting that appropriate supports enable PLWD to do well in their own communities. The identification of PLWD who are at risk of or who make frequent transitions may allow for more proactive implementation of community-based supports and smoother transitions to residential care.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of the presented study was to verify the potential of the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5P) Tropospheric NO2 Column Number Density (NO2 TVCD) to support air pollution monitoring in Poland. The secondary objective of this project was to establish a relationship between air pollution and meteorological conditions. The ERA-5 data together with the NO2 TVCD product and auxiliary data were further assimilated into an artificial intelligence model in order to estimate surface NO2 concentrations. The results revealed that the random forest method was the most accurate method for estimating the surface NO2. The random forest model demonstrated MAE values of 3.4 mu g/m(3) (MAPE similar to 37%) and 3.2 mu g/m(3) (MAPE similar to 31%) for the hourly and weekly estimates, respectively. It was observed that the proposed model could be used for at least 120 days per year due to the cloud-free conditions. Further, it was found that the S-5P NO2 TVCD was the most important variable, which explained more than 50% of the predictions. Other important variables were the nightlights, solar radiation flux, road density, population, and planetary boundary layer height. The predictions obtained with the proposed model were better fitted to the actual surface NO2 concentrations than the CAMS median ensemble estimations (similar to 15% better accuracy).

TI  - Satellite-Detected Contrasting Responses of Canopy Structure and Leaf Physiology to Drought
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Disentangling drought impacts on plant photosynthesis is crucial for projecting future terrestrial carbon dynamics. We examined the separate responses of canopy structure and leaf physiology to an extreme summer drought that occurred in 2011 over Southwest China, where the weather was humid and radiation was the main growth-limiting factor. Canopy structure and leaf physiology were, respectively, represented by near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) derived from MODIS data and leaf scale fluorescence yield (phi(f)) derived from both continuous SIF (CSIF) and global OCO-2 SIF (GOSIF). We detected contrasting responses of canopy structure and leaf physiology to drought with a 14.0% increase in NIRv, compared with 12.6 or 19.3% decreases in phi(f) from CSIF and GOSIF, respectively. The increase in structure resulted in a slight carbon change, due to water deficit-induced physiological constraints. The net ecosystem effect was a 7.5% (CSIF), 1.2% (GOSIF), and -2.96% (EC-LUE GPP) change in photosynthesis. Our study improves understanding of complex vegetation responses of plant photosynthesis to drought and may contribute to the reconciliation of contrasting observed directions in plant responses to drought in cloudy regions via remote sensing.

The study of social factors causing translation problems is closely related to sociolinguistics. The reasons for the incorrect translation can be traced from the point of view of sociolinguistics. The social "language of variants", the functional and the language of variants of the character's personality make it difficult to translate and increase the likelihood of mistakes.

TI  - Learning Lightweight and Superior Detectors with Feature Distillation for Onboard Remote Sensing Object Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - CubeSats provide a low-cost, convenient, and effective way of acquiring remote sensing data, and have great potential for remote sensing object detection. Although deep learning-based models have achieved excellent performance in object detection, they suffer from the problem of numerous parameters, making them difficult to deploy on CubeSats with limited memory and computational power. Existing approaches attempt to prune redundant parameters, but this inevitably causes a degradation in detection accuracy. In this paper, the novel Context-aware Dense Feature Distillation (CDFD) is proposed, guiding a small student network to integrate features extracted from multi-teacher networks to train a lightweight and superior detector for onboard remote sensing object detection. Specifically, a Contextual Feature Generation Module (CFGM) is designed to rebuild the non-local relationships between different pixels and transfer them from teacher to student, thus guiding students to extract rich contextual features to assist in remote sensing object detection. In addition, an Adaptive Dense Multi-teacher Distillation (ADMD) strategy is proposed, which performs adaptive weighted loss fusion of students with multiple well-trained teachers, guiding students to integrate the learning of helpful knowledge from multiple teachers. Extensive experiments were conducted on two large-scale remote sensing object detection datasets with various network structures; the results demonstrate that the trained lightweight network achieves auspicious performance. Our approach also shows good generality for existing state-of-the-art remote sensing object detectors. Furthermore, by experimenting on large general object datasets, we demonstrate that our approach is equally practical for general object detection distillation.

TI  - The impact of onshore wind farms on ecological corridors in Ningbo, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the background of the energy transition, the ecosystems are threatened by the rapid expansion of renewable power plants, especially wind turbines with enormous sizes. While the potential ecological influence near wind farms has not been extensively studied. In the process of wind farm site selection, there is no uniform methodology to assess the ecological impact on the local ecosystem. This paper proposed a research framework to quantify the impacts on ecological corridors under the influence of wind farms. Taking five wind farms in Ningbo Peninsula as cases, the geographical data from Landsat 8, NDVI, DEM, and wind turbine data from Vortex were selected from 2010 to 2020. The ecological sources and resistance surfaces were analyzed with and without wind farms under least-cost distance and least-cost path models. The results revealed that wind farms could increase the migration resistance that prevents the species' ecological corridors, and change the number and routes of main ecological corridors. Additionally, the cumulative resistance value positively correlated with the distance between ecological sources. Through GIS spatial quantification assessment, this paper helps balance wind energy development and regional ecological security and provides scientific and orderly planning suggestions for the healthy development of the regional ecological network.

TI  - Assessing Full-Resolution Pansharpening Quality: A Comparative Study of Methods and Measurements
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the introduction of pansharpening, quality assessment has played a pivotal role in related remote sensing research to ensure the overall system's reliability. Full-resolution (FR) quality assessment is a debated research topic for applications. However, FR assessment faces challenges due to the absence of reference compared to reduced-resolution assessment. Moreover, the lack of ground truth makes measuring quality metrics even more challenging. To summarize the current measures for these two challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of FR methods. We review various FR techniques and analyze how they extract spatial and spectral features from pansharpened images without reference to high-resolution multispectral images. A classification approach is proposed to group these methods based on their shared characteristics, making it easier for researchers and practitioners to compare and select the most appropriate FR method for specific applications. Furthermore, we provide a summary of strategies for measuring FR performance in the absence of ground truth. These strategies are classified into subjective and objective approaches. In addition, we conduct a board analysis on a large-scale public pansharpened database with unified measuring criteria. This unified analysis allows us to present experiments from a statistical perspective, measure FR protocols' performance, and provide a broad qualitative and quantitative analysis. Overall, this study contributes to the development of pansharpening and provides guidance for selecting appropriate FR methods, as well as strategies for measuring FR performance.

TI  - Fishing Vessel Classification in SAR Images Using a Novel Deep Learning Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of deep learning (DL), research on ship classification in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has made remarkable progress. However, such research has primarily focused on classifying large ships with distinct features, such as cargo ships, containers, and tankers. The classification of SAR fishing vessels is extremely challenging because of two main reasons: 1) the small size and minor interclass differences of fishing vessels make learning fine-grained features difficult and 2) determining fishing vessel types is difficult, resulting in a lack of labeled data. Hence, after designing a process framework for vessel tagging, we construct a high-resolution fine-grained fishing vessel classification dataset (FishingVesselSAR), which contains 116 gillnetters, 72 seiners, and 181 trawlers. We then propose a novel DL model (FishNet) that aims to strengthen feature extraction and utilization. In FishNet, we introduce four innovative modules to ensure superior performance in SAR fishing vessel classification: a multipath feature extraction (MUL) module, a feature fusion (FF) module, a multilevel feature aggregation (MFA) module, and a parallel channel and spatial attention (PCSA) module. Furthermore, we design an adaptive loss function to achieve better classification performance by mitigating the effects of class imbalance. In this article, we report extensive ablation studies conducted to confirm the efficacy of the five improvements listed above. Sufficient comparisons with 33 advanced methods from the DL and SAR target classification communities demonstrate that FishNet achieves an SAR fishing vessel classification accuracy of 89.79%, which is 6.77% higher than that of the second-best method.

TI  - Divine Immanence in the Panentheistic Cosmology of Arthur Peacock
T2  - PHILOSOPHY AND COSMOLOGY-FILOSOFIYA I KOSMOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - This brief article examines the features of the panentheistic cosmology of the Protestant theologian Arthur Peacock, with particular attention to the conceptualization of divine immanence in his theological system. In addition, it reveals the organic connection between the categories of "faith" and "miracle" in Protestant theology, and shows the place and role of a miracle in the theological constructions of panentheism. All main conceptualizations of the philosopher and theologian Arthur Peacock are reduced to the so-called "panentheism formula", according to which God is immanent in the universe, truly omnipresent, but his Being is not entirely reduced to natural, God is greater than nature and his Being surpasses nature. Having laid down the initial principles of his panentheistic cosmology, Peacock deductively deduces all the further key provisions of his concept, namely: the doctrine of the nature of the relationship between God and the world, the question of a miracle as a personal manifestation of the divine, etc. In the author's worldview, the world acts as an arena and an instrument for achieving God of large-scale cosmic goals. However, in the ideas about the interaction of God with the world, the theologian also singles out the symbolic aspect, the main content of which is the initiative of God to reveal his Personality and demonstrate to man his divine nature. In other words, we are talking about the relationship of God with the individual and the human community, which reflects the creative essence of God and presupposes the existence of events that reveal important religious truths. In general, it should be recognized that the theorists of panentheism, including Arthur Peacock himself, made a significant contribution to the dialogue between religion and science, which was noted by researchers. However, wishing to preserve the intellectual respectability of their conceptualizations, the ideologists of panentheism bypass or extremely carefully and extremely correctly touch on individual complex problems of theology, the features of divine immanence, incl. and the question of miracle. All cases of the relationship between God and man, including the most extraordinary and super-intense experience of interpersonal communication, can, in their opinion, be more convincingly described in ordinary terms within the framework of their model of "downward influence" on the world, mediated by the components of this world.

TI  - A Physical-Based Method for Pixel-by-Pixel Quantifying Uncertainty of Land Surface Temperature Retrieval From Satellite Thermal Infrared Data Using the Generalized Split-Window Algorithm
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important physical parameter at the interface between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. Accurately quantifying LST uncertainty is essential for the generation of a long-term and consistent LST Climate Data Record (CDR) or Earth System Data Record (ESDR) from either multiple sensors or algorithms. In this study, a physical-based method was proposed to quantify the uncertainty of LST retrieval from satellite thermal infrared (TIR) data using the generalized split-window (GSW) algorithm. LST uncertainties were parameterized as a function of brightness temperature at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and surface emissivity in two split-window channels, which are two key input parameters in the GSW algorithm, as well as their uncertainties. The performance of the parameterized uncertainty model was evaluated according to the simulation dataset at six prescribed viewing zenith angles (VZAs) of 0 degrees, 33.56 degrees, 44.42 degrees, 51.32 degrees, 56.25 degrees, and 60 degrees, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.001 K. The coefficients of the parameterized uncertainty model at arbitrary VZA within a sensor's field of view (FOV) can be obtained by linear interpolation of the coefficients at the six prescribed VZAs. Once the coefficients of the parameterized uncertainty model for each pixel are available, total LST uncertainties can be quantified on a pixel-by-pixel basis. As an example, the parameterized uncertainty model was applied to actual MODIS data for displaying the spatial distribution of LST uncertainties. The results indicate that the parameterized uncertainty model can characterize the spatial variation in LST uncertainties well over various land cover types.

AB  - Inland water bodies show diverse water quality and complexity, which can measured by remotely sensed reflectance in various spectral bands. These reflectance properties can be used to classify water into different optical water types (OWT). The OWT's exhibit distinct spectral characteristics based on absorption and scattering properties of optically active constituents and their concentrations. This study aims to categorize the optical complexity of Indian water bodies in different OWT. More than 12900 water reflectance spectra were extracted over different times of the year from Indian water bodies using Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument. The reflectance spectra were normalized and clustered into thirteen distinct OWT using the cosine distance k-means algorithm. The thirteen OWT represents two types of oligotrophic clear blue waters, three green color chlorophyll dominated mesotrophic water, five sediment-rich brown eutrophic water, and three vegetation rich hyper-eutrophic waters. The temporal dynamics of OWT over India reveal distinct eutrophication changes in water types in different seasons. These changes are congruent with the other limnological, topographical and climatological conditions. Clear oligotrophic waters have maximum extent in month of November. Almost 30 percent of water bodies are always eutrophic. More than 60% of Indian waters are in hyper-eutrophic state during pre-monsoon season. This scheme of water body classification is reliable in understanding the long term changes in eutrophication associated ecotone changes.

TI  - Unraveling the Relationship Between Stubble Burning and Air Quality Degradation in Punjab: A Temporal and Spatial Analysis (2019-2022)
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Stubble burning in Punjab, India, poses significant environmental challenges, particularly impacting air quality. This study aims to examine the spatial and temporal patterns of stubble burning events and their potential effect on ambient air quality from 2019 to 2022. High-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery was employed to delineate the spatial extent of stubble burning. Burnt areas were identified using the Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR). Air quality was evaluated based on PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations data obtained from the Punjab Pollution Control Board. The Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation technique was used to estimate pollution values in areas lacking direct monitoring. The study revealed significant year-to-year variations in areas affected by stubble burning. The smallest burnt areas were recorded in October 2019 and 2021 (209 sq km), while the largest was in 2020 (755.38 sq km). In every year studied, the burnt area in November consistently exceeded that in October, with the largest area (10315 sq km) observed in 2021. PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations also showed annual fluctuations, with the highest recorded in 2020 and 2021. In particular, in October 2020, higher PM2.5 and PM10 levels were detected in the eastern region of Punjab. November consistently exhibited higher PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations than October for all years analysed, peaking in 2021. The spatial and temporal variations of stubble burning events and their relationship with air quality highlight the need for targeted interventions. Understanding these patterns is crucial for mitigating the adverse effects of stubble burning on air quality in Punjab, India. Future research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies.

TI  - Comprehensive Error Analysis of CLDAS Soil Moisture Over Arid and Semiarid Regions
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an important parameter in all environments because it affects the relationship between the land surface and atmospheric processes. Therefore, finding products that can accurately measure SM is critical to improving drought management. The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of satellite data from SM produced by the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS), focusing on the Huaihe and Heihe River basins in China, as both are prone to drought. To verify the accuracy of the daily surface data SM, measurements were obtained from 34 meteorological stations between January and December 2016. In addition, CLDAS measurement data were collected at a depth of 10 cm and 40 cm and compared with observed soil moisture measurements (OBS SM). The results show that the agreement of CLDAS SM with OBS was R > 0.66 at 10 cm and R > 0.47 at 40 cm in the Huaihe River Basin. R > 0.63 at 10 cm and R > 0.44 at 40 cm was observed in Heihe River Basin.

TI  - Object-Level Hybrid Spatiotemporal Fusion: Reaching a Better Tradeoff Among Spectral Accuracy, Spatial Accuracy, and Efficiency
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) is a cost-effective way to complement the spatiotemporal resolution of multisource images, which has been employed in various applications requiring image sequences. In real-world applications, the spectral accuracy, spatial accuracy, and efficiency of STF play a critical role. Despite this, most STF methods focus on improving spectral accuracy, whereas the challenges of spatial information loss and low efficiency have received limited attention. In addition, the improvements in spectral accuracy, spatial accuracy, and efficiency in STF are contradictory, and existing STF methods cannot balance them well, which limits their reliability and applicability for various STF tasks. To solve the above-mentioned issues, this study proposes an object-level hybrid STF method (OL-HSTFM), which incorporates the efficiency advantage of the object-level fusion strategy, spectral accuracy advantage of the three-step method (Fit-FC), and the spatial accuracy advantage of the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model. The performance of OL-HSTFM was compared with two classic STF methods and eight state-of-the-art STF methods at two sites. The experimental results indicate that OL-HSTFM outperforms the other ten methods in overall performance and has excellent efficiency. Furthermore, this study proposes a new metric that can assess the accuracy of both spatial and spectral domains in STF, which provides a more comprehensive and intuitive measurement of the quality of fused images compared to commonly used metrics.

TI  - Distillation-Based Hashing Transformer for Cross-Modal Vessel Image Retrieval
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cross-modal image retrieval has attracted much attention in remote sensing (RS) data analysis these years, and however, the retrieval of target images, such as surface vessels, receives little interest. Considering the complex geometric features of vessel images and the modality gap, the widely used joint feature learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) tends to have low precision. In this letter, a distillation-based hashing transformer (DBHT) is proposed to solve the above problems. Specifically, we adopt vision transformer (ViT) as the feature extractor for target images and a hash token is designed and attended to ViT for hashing generation. To avoid the precision attenuation caused by the uncontrollability in common feature space construction, we design a two-step feature learning strategy and build a well-performed unimodal hashing retrieval framework first and then transfer the hashing knowledge to another modality. Two distillation strategies, as well as cross-modal weighted triplet loss, are designed to supervise the above process and ensure complete knowledge transfer. Cross-modal weight transfer is also adopted to bridge the modality gap. Extensive experiments on two bimodal vessel image datasets show that the proposed DBHT is superior to several cross-modal hashing baselines in cross-modal vessel image retrieval tasks.

T2  - Scientific reports
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - A systematic understanding of the spatio-temporal changes and driving factors in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau holds significant scientific reference value for the future of ecological sustainable development. This paper utilizes MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and meteorological data to investigate the spatio-temporal changes and driving factors of vegetation coverage in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2001 to 2020. Methods employed include the dimidiate pixel model, trend analysis, partial correlation analysis, and residual analysis. The results demonstrate a generally fluctuating upward trend in vegetation coverage across the Tibetan Plateau over the past two decades, with spatial expansion occurring from northwest to southeast. Vegetation coverage exhibits a positive correlation with climate factors. Approximately 60.7% of the area showed a positive correlation between vegetation fractional cover (FVC) and precipitation, with 8.66% of the area demonstrating extremely significant (p<0.05) and significant (p<0.01) positive correlation. Human activities, on the whole, have contributed to the enhancement of vegetation cover in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The areas where human activities have positively impacted vegetation cover are primarily situated in north-central Qinghai and north of Ngari, while areas experiencing degradation include certain grassland regions in central-eastern Yushu, Nagqu, and Lhasa.

TI  - Combining Luojia1-01 Nighttime Light and Points-of-Interest Data for Fine Mapping of Population Spatialization Based on the Zonal Classification Method
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale population spatial distribution plays an important role in urban microcosmic research, influencing infrastructure placement, emergency evacuation management, business decisions, and urban planning. In the past, nighttime light (NTL) data were generally used to map the spatial distribution of the population at a large scale because of their low spatial resolution. The new generation of Luojia1-01 NTL data can be used for fine-scale social and economic analysis with its high spatial resolution and quantitative range. However, due to the geometry and background noise of the data themselves, the accuracy of the original NTL data is still low. Points-of-interest (POI) also can be used to map the population spatialization, but the indicative relationship between the POI and population is not clear, especially in rural and urban areas with different landscape structures. To solve the above-mentioned problems, this study proposes an improved nighttime light (INTL) index to better use the Luojia1-01 NTL data. Meanwhile, a zonal classification model based on INTL and impervious surface area is proposed to distinguish urban and rural areas. Compared with previous research and existing datasets, our result had the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.86). This study explains that the INTL index is applicable to population spatialization research with the emergence of high-resolution and multispectral NTL satellite data. Moreover, the zonal classification model in this research can significantly improve the accuracy of population spatialization in rural areas. This study provides a possible way to use NTL and POI data in other social and economic spatialization research.

TI  - Passive Only Microwave Soil Moisture Retrieval in Indian Cropping Conditions: Model Parameterization and Validation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - present study carried out to parameterize the single channel soil moisture active passive (SMAP) passive soil moisture (SM) retrieval algorithm, over Indian conditions. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data products and soil texture data were used for an improved parameterization of the algorithm. The bias correction was applied to the MODIS leaf area index (LAI) for accurate computation of vegetation optical depth. The necessary vegetation and roughness parameter were calibrated through minimization of the error between model retrieved and ground measured SM. The value of root mean square error (RMSE) for retrieved SM was found as 0.059 m3m(-3) with bias and correlation coefficients of 0.036 m3m(-3) and 0.724 for ascending overpass, respectively, while a lower value was recorded (RMSE = 0.059 m3m(-3), bias = 0.024 m3m(-3), and correlation coefficients = 0.752) for descending overpass. The same method is also implemented on two other test sites in different regions of India to check the model robustness, which indicates that the current parameterization provides a better estimate of SM over croplands in India. The overall performance of new parameterized model is found as (RMSE = 0.052 and bias = 0.034) for ascending and descending (RMSE = 0.048 and bias = 0.026) satellite overpasses for all the three test sites. Additionally, the intercomparing of various operational SM products SMAP SM (L2_SM_P), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) SM (SMOS_L3_SM), and SMOS-IC data products was carried out with the SAC-ISRO PAN India SM network, which showed a significant RMSE, dry and wet biases over all three test sites as compared to the developed improved parameterized algorithm.

AB  - Imphal Valley (India) is the part of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) biodiversity hotspots in India where the Imphal River and Loktak Lake form their lifelines. This region is dynamically changing at an unprecedented pace and the effects of such Land use change need to be quantified accurately. In this work, we used both optical satellite data and microwave (Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)) data to prepare the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) map of the area for 2015 and 2021. We used Landsat-8 and Sentinel 1A satellite data for 2015 and 2021. We compared our results with optical-derived LULC as well as earlier published literature. We have classified the area into seven classes namely waterbody, Phumdis, settlement, horticulture farm, paddy farm, forest, and bare land, and used the Random Forest Machine learning (ML) algorithm for image classification. We observed a significant decrease in waterbody, Phumdis, and forest areas with an increase in the settlement, paddy, and horticulture farm between 2015 and 2021. We observed that settlement and water bodies were better classified when we used both the data rather than optical data only. The k-fold overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (KC) for combined data was 87% and 0.83 for 2015 and OA-90%, KC-0.86 for 2021, where k=10. These values were lower for only Landsat-8 derived LULC.

AB  - Canopy height (CH) is an important parameter for better managing forests, biomass assessment and biodiversity conservation. The study's goal is the spatial mapping of CH by combining ICESat-2 and optical data information from Landsat-9 and Sentinel-2 using a support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Further, the most to least important predictors were identified for CH prediction. This assessment was performed in the Corbett Tiger reserve (CTR), Himalayan Uttrakhand state of India. The result showed that the mean CH in the CTR is 32.61 m. Root mean square error (RMSE) (5.339 m and 5.456 m), mean absolute error (MAE) (4.048 m and 4.166 m), and R-squared (R2) (0.552 and 0.531) were the optimal training values for SVM and RF, respectively. Models testing between observed and predicted CH showed the RMSE is 5.42 m and 5.53 m, MAE is 4.10 m and 4.20, and R2 is 0.55 and 0.53 for SVM and RF, respectively. Canopy profiles and metrics at percentiles height (PH) are dominant predictors. Landsat-8 derived vegetative indices (VI's) have moderate importance. Such an integrated approach is helpful in managing CTR and CH mapping of other protected forests.

M3  - Article
AB  - The soil cover is a fundamental indicator to identify the factors that act in the development of the geomorphology of an alluvial plain. This coverage is characterized by the control exercised by the vegetation in the hydromorphological processes, as well as the maintenance and stability of the fluvial channels. A record on the distribution of land cover in the middle course of the anastomosed system of the Apure River is presented. The distribution of geomorphological environments in an area of 65 km2 is analyzed from a combination of data from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images, integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS). A supervisedclassification was established using the Support Vector Machine and Maximum Likelihood algorithms. The Landsat image was processed through an atmospheric correction, to later calculate the spectral signatures. Six covers were found: a) wooded savannah, b) forest, c) open savannah, d) crops, e) bodies of water, and f) scrub. There are no substantial differences in the reliability achieved with the Support Vector Machines and Maximum Likelihood classification algorithms. It was shown that the woodland cover is the most representative in the study area with a total extension of 5,717.26 ha (39%), out of 14,658.77 ha. The classification presented a global thematic accuracy of 98.08% and a Kappa index of 0.98. As a result, a soil cover cartography was generated from the best classifier, based on the Kappa index. These findings serve as a reference to increase the records of soil cover characterization and can be useful in studies on management and use of the territory, to identify places more susceptible to degradation and propose measures for the management and conservation of water resources, which can be potentially applicable in similar fluvial environments in other latitudes.

TI  - What if what I want to say is not enough for what I have to say?" Expanding Meaning-Making Opportunities by Using Adinkra Symbols and Yoruba Proverbs
T2  - JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND LITERACY EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As University literacy professors of West African descent, we utilise our trans-linguistic mix of practices for meaning-making opportunities, especially as we sometimes face situations where English words are insufficient in conveying our intended meaning. This paper, grounded in African-centred theory and semiotics theory, presents the use of Adinkra symbols and Yoruba proverbs to facilitate instruction, dialogic exchanges, and provide feedback. This widens the angles of literacy, centres our Africanness and broadens our students' literacy worldview. Having grown up and being steeped in these other linguistic repertoires as we are, we found that utilising a trans-linguistic mix of praxis using Adinkra symbols and Yoruba proverbs helps us to (1) articulately and accurately express ourselves when it comes to dialogic interaction and feedback, (2) build on meaning-making practices and broaden discussion in dialogic exchanges, (3) provide our students with another linguistic worldview that goes beyond the Eurocentric meaning-making experience and language use, and to (4) serve to illuminate our cultural practices while simultaneously documenting our linguistic heritage for historical preservation.

TI  - APPLICATION OF MULTI-TEMPORAL LANDSAT IMAGES TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE (LST) AND THE LAND USE LAND COVER (LULC) IN HO CHI MINH CITY

AB  - Urban sprawl has changed the land use land cover (LULC) in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). It has caused the gradual decline of the natural vegetation and rapid increase of the impervious surface, which leads to the heat storage capacity of the urban surface being on the rise. There is a land surface temperature (LST) difference between the urban center and surrounding areas and it creates the urban heat island phenomenon (UHI). This study used Landsat 4, 5, and Landsat 8 satellite image data from 1990 to 2020 with the GIS algorithms on ENVI and ArcGIS to analyze and estimate the correlation between the LULC and the LST in HCMC. The Kappa coefficients of the LULC classifications were all over 0.8 in 1990 - 2020 period. The total area of impervious surface has increased by 57,338 hectares over the past 30 years; while the total area of natural green has decreased by 19,116 hectares. The LST has remarkably increased in the areas of construction lands, industrial zones, and impervious surfaces, with an average increase from 22 degrees C to 27 degrees C. While the LST in the others such as the vegetation surface and water surface were slower, from 20 degrees C to 23 degrees C. The solution of enhancing the urban green space was suggested to mitigate the increasing LST impact on HCMC.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: The objective of this report is to describe the technique and diagnostic utility of indirect lymphography (IL) using water-soluble contrast for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in dogs with mast cell tumors.Animals: Fifty-three dogs with 59 mast cell tumors were included.Procedure: Medical records were retrieved for dogs with a cytological diagnosis of mast cell tumor which also had IL performed for lymph node mapping. Dogs were excluded when surgery had been performed before presentation. Images were reviewed by a Board-certified radiologist for uptake of contrast within the sentinel lymph node.Results: Lymphography studies from 34 tumors (57.6%) were diagnostic (clearly identifiable lymphatics and sentinel lymph node). Lymphography studies from 12 tumors (20.3%) were partially diagnostic (identifiable lymphatics, but sentinel lymph node not highlighted). Lymphography studies from 13 tumors (22%) were non-diagnostic. Indirect lymphography studies were interpreted as either diagnostic or partially diagnostic in 77.9% of tumors.Conclusion: The results indicate that IL is a simple, available technique to allow for identification of a sentinel lymph node in dogs with mast cell tumors.Clinical relevance: Indirect lymphography is a simple and widely accessible technique for SLN mapping in dogs with mast cell tumors, particularly for the general practice environment.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Filtering Approach for Tomographic SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR) has recently received particular interest from the remote-sensing community, due to its ability to provide 3-D reconstructions of environments with complex structures. Unfortunately, different forms of decorrelations and processing errors affect the quality of the resulting 2-D/3-D images. One way to cope with the impact of these nuisances is to apply appropriate filtering to the interferometric data stack as a preprocessing step. The first obstacle to be dealt with, especially in urban areas, is to define a filter whose parameters have to be set in such a way as to improve smoothing capabilities while preserving edges. To this aim, the main objective of this article is twofold: 1) the application of a spatio-temporal contextual filter whose parameters depend on 3-D quality indicators of the multibaseline interferometric image stack and 2) evaluation of the denoising effect on the application of nonparametric spectral estimation and detection algorithms. For that, we consider several quantitative metrics to assess, on the one hand, the filtering performances, and, on the other hand, its impact on the reflectivity function recovered from conventional tomographic inversion and detection methods. Experimental results from a set of TerraSAR-X (TSX) images highlight the efficiency of the filtering process by improving the scatterers' detection and height localization, of a man-made structure.

TI  - Gap-Filling Sentinel-1 Offshore Wind Speed Image Time Series Using Multiple-Point Geostatistical Simulation and Reanalysis Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Offshore wind is expected to play a key role in future energy systems. Wind energy resource studies often call for long-term and spatially consistent datasets to assess the wind potential. Despite the vast amount of available data sources, no current means can provide relevant sub-daily information at a fine spatial scale (similar to 1 km). Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) delivers wind field estimates over the ocean at fine spatial resolution but suffers from partial coverage and irregular revisit times. Physical model outputs, which are the basis of reanalysis products, can be queried at any time step but lack fine-scale spatial variability. To combine the advantages of both, we use the framework of multiple-point geostatistics to realistically reconstruct wind speed patterns at time instances for which satellite information is absent. Synthetic fine-resolution wind speed images are generated conditioned to coregistered regional reanalysis information at a coarser scale. Available simultaneous data sources are used as training data to generate the synthetic image time series. The latter are then evaluated via cross validation and statistical comparison against reference satellite data. Multiple realizations are also generated to assess the uncertainty associated with the simulation outputs. Results show that the proposed methodology can realistically reproduce fine-scale spatiotemporal variability while honoring the wind speed patterns at the coarse scale and thus filling the satellite information gaps in space and time.

TI  - CORAL REEF HEALTH INDEX CALCULATION FROM REMOTE SENSING DATA: A REVIEW
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The coral reef ecosystem plays an important role as a provider of ecosystem services and has various economic benefits to the coastal community. However, the coral reefs ecosystem continues to degrade by 19% globally. This degradation caused some coastal and archipelagic countries have developed methods of calculating coral reef health index, including Indonesia. However, some literature shows that there is no common standard method for coral reef health index as the analysis depends on the data availability and the purpose of the study. Remote sensing technology that currently provides much open-source data is a potential method /tool to calculate the health index of coral reefs if the required parameters are met. This article review aims to identify remote sensing data used in the existing coral health indexes and then analyze the integration of all spatial data for coral reef health index calculation. Reference searches are sourced from the SCOPUS database combined with search engines Harzing and Mendeley. There are five coral reef health index calculation models from 25 references consisting of 19 publications and six reports out of 209 filtered references using keywords of Coral Reef Health Index. As a result, coral reef cover and algae are commonly used data obtained from remote sensing imagery. However, remote sensing technology cannot estimate other important parameters such as fish biomass. In addition, physical information of the waters, such as sea surface temperature (SST) and water clarity indicators (turbidity and diffused attenuation coefficient), are parameters contained in the five indexes that can be obtained from remote sensing data. In general, the literature review shows that coral reef health indicators (e.g. index or individual benthic cover) are significantly related to the various parameters affecting coral reef degradation such as algae cover, rubble cover, SST and river plump either as an individual or multivariate factors.

TI  - Intensified Warming and Aridity Accelerate Terminal Lake Desiccation in the Great Basin of the Western United States
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Terminal lakes in the Great Basin (GB) of the western US host critical wildlife habitat and food for migrating birds and can be associated with serious human health and economic consequences when they desiccate. Water levels have declined dramatically in the last 100+ years due to diversion of inflows, drought and climate change. Satellite-derived environmental science data records (ESDRs) from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (snow cover, evapotranspiration (ET) and land surface temperature (LST)), enable a unique approach to evaluate the effects of aridification on terminal lakes and to study their individual vulnerabilities. Surface and air temperatures in the GB are rising dramatically, with a sharp rise in the rate of increase observed beginning around 2011, while the number of days of snow cover is declining especially in the western mountainous part of the GB as exemplified in Mono Basin, California. Rising temperatures coincide with fewer days of snow cover, a decrease of inflow to the lakes and greater evaporation of water from the lakes. MODIS ESDRs show strong and statistically significant increasing surface temperature (LST) in the GB, a reduction in the number of days of snow cover, and mixed results in ET. ET declined slightly in the more arid parts of the GB due to greater moisture restrictions to evaporation from extended drought, while ET increased in the more-vegetated, wetter, mountainous northeastern parts as temperatures have risen. Severe and costly ecological, human health and economic consequences are expected if the lakes continue to decline as predicted.

TI  - Improved parametrisation of a physically-based forest reflectance model for retrieval of boreal forest structural properties
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Physically-based reflectance models offer a robust and transferable method to assess biophysical characteristics of vegetation in remote sensing. Forests exhibit explicit structure at many scales, from shoots and branches to landscape patches, and hence present a specific challenge to vegetation reflectance modellers. To relate forest reflectance with its structure, the complexity must be parametrised leading to an increase in the number of reflectance model inputs. The parametrisations link reflectance simulations to measurable forest variables, but at the same time rely on abstractions (e.g. a geometric surface forming a tree crown) and physically-based simplifications that are difficult to quantify robustly. As high-quality data on basic forest structure (e.g. tree height and stand density) and optical properties (e.g. leaf and forest floor reflectance) are becoming increasingly available, we used the well-validated forest reflectance and transmittance model FRT to investigate the effect of the values of the "uncertain" input parameters on the accuracy of modelled forest reflectance. With the state-of-the-art structural and spectral forest information, and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument imagery, we identified that the input parameters influencing the most the modelled reflectance, given that the basic forestry variables are set to their true values and leaf mass is determined from reliable allometric models, are the regularity of the tree distribution and the amount of woody elements. When these parameters were set to their new adjusted values, the model performance improved considerably, reaching in the near infrared spectral region (740-950 nm) nearly zero bias, a relative RMSE of 13% and a correlation coefficient of 0.81. In the visible part of the spectrum, the model performance was not as consistent indicating room for improvement.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF PHOTOMETRIC FULL-FACE PARAMETERS WITH A DISTAL BITE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE TYPES OF MANDIBULAR GROWTH.
T2  - Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: Determination of the peculiarities of full-face aesthetics in patients aged 10-13 years with a distal bite with different types of mandibular growth.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 74 patients aged 10-13 years with a distal bite and various types of mandibular growth took part in the study. The methods of photostatic image study described by I.I. Uzhumetskene (1970), V.P. Pereverzev (1979) were used in this research.RESULTS: Results: To determine the type of face, a gl-me: zy-zy index was calculated. Index values ranging from 0.84 to 0.879 are indicative of a mesoprosopic (medium) type of face, an index less than 0.839 defines a europrosopic (broad) type, an index exceeding 0.88 is characteristic of a leptoprosopic (narrow) type. The facial shape in all patients was determined by the Izar facial-morphological index. Similarly, the facial shape can be determined by the facial tapered angle (< FTA). In all groups of teenagers, a decrease in the angle is noted, which is indicative of an elongated, narrow face. To assess the ratio of the middle and lower parts of the face, the gl-sn:sn-me index was used, which is normally equal to 1. In our case, this index was higher than normal in all groups of children as compared to the control group (1.01±0.03). The p-p:zy-zy and p-p:go-go indices are indicative of the harmonious facial development transversally.CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Vertical and neutral-vertical type of mandibular growth results in a narrow (leptoprosopic) type of face; medium (mesoprosopic) and wide (europrosopic) types of face result from neutral, horizontal and neutral-horizontal types of growth. Irrespective of the type of mandibular growth, all patients with a distal bite have a short lower third of the face. The strongest aesthetic changes are reported in the group of patients with a predominance of the horizontal type of mandibular growth.

TI  - Fast Flood Extent Monitoring With SAR Change Detection Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the most frequent and disastrous natural hazards triggered by extreme precipitation, high river runoff, hurricane storm surges, and the compounding effects of various flood drivers. This study introduces a new multisource remote sensing approach that leverages both multispectral optical imagery and the weather- and illumination-independent characteristics of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to streamline, automate, and map geographically reliable flood inundation extents. Utilizing the near real-time and cloud computing capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE), this process facilitates data acquisition and enables large-scale flood monitoring in an expeditious manner. Two major hurricanes along the U.S. Gulf Coast were evaluated: 1) the 2021 Hurricane Ida to the south of New Orleans, LA, USA, and 2) the 2017 Hurricane Harvey to the east of Houston, TX, USA. We devised a change detection and thresholding framework using multitemporal SAR imagery and validated the results with flood extent maps derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 optical imagery. We demonstrate that constant threshold values for flood extraction from SAR change detection indices are not ubiquitously suitable for all geographies; thus, we outline a heuristic that can be used to select thresholds suitable for specific sites through a fully automated sensitivity analysis. The results indicated high agreement between the SAR and optical imagery (77%-80%), with SAR providing the benefit of under-cloud detection. Furthermore, our results contribute to scaling the SAR approach to produce rapid and accurate information for decision-makers and emergency responders during time-sensitive flood events.

TI  - Satellite monitoring for coastal dynamic adaptation policy pathways
T2  - CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic adaptation policy pathways provide a roadmap for coastal communities to establish a suite of sea level rise adaptation responses based on observation-driven signals of increasing risk. This adaptation approach relies heavily on iterative assessment of sea level rise observations and model projections. Remote sensing capabilities from satellites offer an opportunity to assess a consistent set of observational data indicators, around which adaptation pathways can be built. The large-scale nature and broad coverage of satellite observations provide the benefit of consistent monitoring capabilities across the globe, for regions with differing needs, resources, and monitoring capacities. In this study, we identify four categories of data indicators that can be monitored with satellites to support decision making in adaptation pathways: sea level rise, individual processes contributing to sea level rise, impacts of sea level rise, and impacts on implemented adaptation strategies. We review these categories in relation to existing adaptation pathway signposts and the available satellite data. As we highlight the opportunities for satellitebased contributions to sea level adaptation pathways, we also outline potential limitations, opportunities to overcome these limitations, and future steps that can be taken to integrate satellite observations into adaptation pathways.

TI  - Validation of the TOA Products of the Baotou Sandy Site With Landsat8/OLI Considering BRDF Correction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Baotou sandy site in China is an important field site in the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites radiometric calibration network (RadCalNet), which freely releases the bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral reflectance products in the spectral range from 400 to 1000 nm at 10 nm intervals with the aid of a set of automatic spectral and atmospheric parameter measurement devices. However, the released TOA and BOA spectral reflectance products are nadir-view spectral reflectance, which could produce errors if the Baotou sandy site is offset from the nadir point when they are utilized to calibrate one satellite sensor with the vicarious calibration method or to detect radiometric performance changes in the target sensor. Therefore, to address this problem and further broaden the applicable scopes of TOA spectral reflectance products, this article develops TOA and BOA bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models using valid time-series TOA and BOA spectral reflectance products to fulfill BRDF correction. Then, the corrected TOA spectral reflectance is validated with the on-orbit measured TOA spectral reflectance of the Landsat8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor with high and stable radiometric performance. After analyzing the fitting accuracies of the BOA and TOA BRDF models, the influences of the filter criteria of valid time-series nadir-view BOA and TOA spectral reflectance, geo-positioning error of Landsat8/OLI, and aerosol type in the BOA BRDF correction process on the validation results are discussed. The results show that the BOA BRDF model obtains a better correction effect and is more stable than the TOA BRDF model.

TI  - Central Cohesion Gradual Hashing for Remote Sensing Image Retrieval
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the recent development of remote sensing technology, large image repositories have been collected. In order to retrieve the desired images of massive remote sensing data sets effectively and efficiently, we propose a novel central cohesion gradual hashing (CCGH) mechanism for remote sensing image retrieval. First, we design a deep hashing model based on ResNet-18 which has a shallow architecture and extracts features of remote sensing imagery effectively and efficiently. Then, we propose a new training model by minimizing a central cohesion loss which guarantees that remote-sensing hash codes are as close to their hash code centers as possible. We also adopt a quantization loss which promotes that outputs are binary values. The combination of both loss functions produces highly discriminative hash codes. Finally, a gradual sign-like function is used to reduce quantization errors. By means of the aforementioned developments, our CCGH achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in the task of remote sensing image retrieval. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public remote sensing image data sets. The obtained results support the fact that our newly developed CCGH is competitive with other existing deep hashing methods.

TI  - ZY-444 inhibits the growth and metastasis of prostate cancer by targeting TNFAIP3 through TNF signaling pathway
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Prostate cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies, and androgen deprivation therapy remains the mainstay of treatment for prostate cancer patients. Although androgen deprivation can initially come to remission, the disease often develops into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is still dependent on androgen receptor (AR) signaling and is related to a poor prognosis. Some success against CRPC has been achieved by drugs that target AR signaling, but secondary resistance uninterrupted emerges, and new therapies are urgently needed. In this study, we identified a potent small molecule compound, ZY-444, that suppressed PCa cells proliferation and metastasis, and inhibited tumor growth both in subcutaneous. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that TNFAIP3 was significantly elevated in prostate cancer cells after ZY-444 treatment. Further studies through overexpression of TNFAIP3 confirmed that TNFAIP3, as a direct target gene of ZY-444, contributes to the functions of ZY-444. In addition, we demonstrated the effects of TNFAIP3 on prostate cancer cell apoptosis, migration and proliferation to elucidate the mechanism of ZY-444. We found that TNFAIP3 inhibited the TNF signaling pathway, which could inhibit cell migration and proliferation and contribute to apoptosis. Overall, these findings highlighted TNFAIP3 as a tumor suppressor gene in the regulation of the progression and metastatic potential of prostate cancer and that targeting TNFAIP3 by ZY-444 might be a promising strategy for prostate cancer treatment.

TI  - Decoupling Between Different Polarization Channels of PolSAR Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purer contributions obtained from three diagonal elements of the coherency matrix are expected. This makes polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) easier to understand and to use in some applications, since the main information is aggregated into three mutually independent polarization channels. Therefore, we propose a method to decouple different polarization channels (DDPCs) in this letter. In such a case, all the nondiagonal elements of the coherency matrix are turned to zero, and three uncorrelated polarization channels are obtained. For this purpose, two rotation angles with physical meaning are proposed. They are responsible for rotating T12 to zero. Radarsat-2 data are used to validate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed rotation angles are effective for land-cover classification. Furthermore, three polarization channels obtained from the DDPC method can mitigate the overestimation of volume scattering power for oriented buildings.

TI  - Estimating Soil Salinity Using Multiple Spectral Indexes and Machine Learning Algorithm in Songnen Plain, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the most critical threats to land degradation in arid and semiarid regions. This study is based on machine learning using Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) imagery to estimate soil salinity in Da'an City. A total of 19 spectral indexes, including 15 salinity indexes, 3 vegetation indexes, and a brightness index, were calculated using the blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands of Landsat 8 OLI images. Four machine learning regression algorithms, namely Cubist, support vector regression, random forest regression, and extreme gradient boosting regression, were used on the basis of the 19 aforementioned indexes to estimate soil salinity. Results demonstrated that the Cubist model has the highest prediction accuracy (RMSE = 0.31 mS/cm). Thus, the spatial distribution of soil salinity based on the Cubist model best meets the expectations of the authors. Moreover, the canopy salinity index correlated the most with the measured electrical conductivity, demonstrating a correlation coefficient of -0.44. After using the random forest method for variable screening, the Cubist model based on nine spectral indexes still achieved satisfactory prediction accuracy with the RMSE of 0.34 mS/cm. Thus, the Cubist method is recommended for soil salinity monitoring in arid and semiarid areas.

TI  - Identification and Correction of Radio Frequency Interference of Fengyun-3 Microwave Radiation Imager Using a Machine-Learning Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radio frequency signals can interfere with the radiation emanating from the earth's atmosphere and affect the quality of the data received from spaceborne microwave instruments. For microwave radiation imager (MWRI) carried on China's Fengyun-3 series satellites, the data contaminated by radio frequency interference (RFI) are usually identified and labeled as poor quality. In this study, using the high correlation between the observed brightness temperatures (TBs) of MWRI channels, an RFI identification and correction method is developed through machine learning techniques. Compared with traditional methods, the new method can simultaneously identify and correct RFI-affected data. Since it is trained with global MWRI data, the method works well for both land and oceans. Our analysis shows that the MWRI data affected by RFI can be corrected to a quality level close to RFI-free regions.

TI  - Dynamic Mapping of Inland Freshwater Aquaculture Areas in Jianghan Plain, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater aquaculture in Jianghan Plain plays a key role in the whole industry of China. It was expanding rapidly to meet the fast-growing demand of consumption in these decades. The spatial distribution change of aquaculture in Jianghan Plain has attracted many researchers in recent years and it is worth further investigating. However, the accuracy and the quality of inland aquaculture classification and mapping still have space to be improved. Our study attempts to use Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to classify aquaculture areas, nonaquaculture water, and nonwater areas. We applied image segmentation and pixel-based feature computation to obtain candidate datasets. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to find the optimal datasets which were then imported into a modified UNet for classification. This workflow was then applied to the annual datasets for better observation of the spatial change of aquaculture areas. In total, 12 indices and features were found most influential and preserved after RFE. The overall classification accuracy reached 96.83%, while the precision and recall of aquaculture areas reached 84.47% and 90.48%, respectively. The combination of object-based and pixel-based image analysis showed its advantage in inland aquaculture classification compared to other studies. Integrated rice-crawfish farming was found a key factor motivating the rapid development of aquaculture. Policies about the fishing ban and ecosystem restoration were also found deeply affecting the spatial change of aquaculture in Jianghan Plain.

TI  - On the Method of Circular Polarimetric SAR Calibration Using Distributed Targets
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The channel imbalance and crosstalks are the two major factors for the polarimetric calibration of the circular quad-polarimetric (CQP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. In existing methods using distributed targets, the latter is usually ignored, which may lead to unbearable errors in target classification, surface parameter inversion, and so on. To address this issue, this article proposes a modified iterative calibration method using distributed targets that satisfy quasi-azimuth symmetry to calibrate both the channel imbalance and crosstalks of the CQP SAR systems. First, a stable distributed target selection strategy is proposed based on the correlation coefficient of LL polarization and RR polarization, the cross- and co-polarization backscatter ratio, and the equivalent number of looks (ENL). These parameters are insensitive to polarization distortion, and their typical ranges are determined via numerical simulations. Their combination helps select the targets that satisfy the quasi-azimuth symmetry, which is critical for calibrating the crosstalks. Then, the calibration can be conducted using the selected target. Finally, the phase ambiguity of the receive channel imbalance ratio, commonly found in distributed-target-based algorithms, is eliminated using a dipole target. Through the calibration of Gaofen-3 data and the statistical analysis of residual distortion, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified.

TI  - A Subpixel Mapping Method for Urban Land Use by Reducing Shadow Effects
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land use classification is significant for urban development planning. Considering complex environments of urban surface features, traditional semantic segmentation methods are difficult to solve the problems of mixed pixels and limited spatial resolution of images. The subpixel mapping technology is an effective method to solve the above problems in urban land use classification. However, traditional subpixel mapping methods are sensitive to mountain shadow, high-rise building shadow and impermeable surface heterogeneity, resulting in false classification. Therefore, we propose a subpixel mapping method that can reduce the shadow effect. This method uses a multi-index feature fusion strategy to optimize the abundance of the shadow errors in the abundance image, and uses a super-resolution reconstruction neural network model to reconstruct the optimized abundance image for the subpixel mapping of urban land use. Experiments were conducted on sentinel-2 images obtained over Yuelu District of Changsha City, Hunan Province, China. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this article can effectively overcome the influence of building shadows and mountain shadows in urban land cover classification and is superior to traditional subpixel/pixel spatial attraction model, radial basis function, super-resolution subpixel mapping, and other methods in the effect and accuracy of urban land use subpixel mapping.

TI  - Assessment of Runoff Components of River Flow in the Karakoram Mountains, Pakistan, during 1995-2010
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are generally believed to be subjugating by global warming but the Karakoram glaciers are reportedly maintaining their balance. Earlier studies in the Karakoram and its sub-basins have mostly addressed a short span of time and used complex models to understand the phenomenon. Thus, this study is based on a long-term trend analysis of the computed runoff components using satellite data with continuous spatial and temporal coverage incorporated into a simple degree day Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM). The trends of melt runoff components can help us understanding the future scenarios of the glaciers in the study area. The SRM was calibrated against the recorded river flows in the Hunza River Basin (HRB). Our simulations showed that runoff contribution from rain, snow, and glaciers are 14.4%, 34.2%, and 51.4%, respectively during 1995-2010. The melting during the summer has slightly increased, suggesting overall but modest glacier mass loss which consistent with a few recent studies. The annual stream flows showed a rising trend during the 1995-2010 period, while, rainfall and temperatures showed contrasting increasing/decreasing behavior in the July, August, and September months during the same period. The average decreasing temperatures (0.08 degrees C per annum) in July, August, and September makes it challenging and unclear to explain the reason for this rising trend of runoff but a rise in precipitation in the same months affirms the rise in basin flows. At times, the warmer rainwater over the snow and glacier surfaces also contributed to excessive melting. Moreover, the uncertainties in the recorded hydrological, meteorological, and remote sensing data due to low temporal and spatial resolution also portrayed contrasting results. Gradual climate change in the HRB can affect river flows in the near future, requiring effective water resource management to mitigate any adverse impacts. This study shows that assessment of long-term runoff components can be a good alternative to detect changes in melting glaciers with minimal field observations.

TI  - Radiomics model of diffusion-weighted whole-body imaging with background signal suppression (DWIBS) for predicting axillary lymph node status in breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF X-RAY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: In breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, non-invasive prediction of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis can help avoid complications related to sentinel lymph node biopsy.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models using radiomics features extracted from diffusion-weighted whole-body imaging with background signal suppression (DWIBS) examination for predicting the ALN status.METHODS: A total of 100 patients with histologically proven, invasive, clinically N0 breast cancer who underwent DWIBS examination consisting of short tau inversion recovery (STIR) and DWIBS sequences before surgery were enrolled. Radiomic features were calculated using segmented primary lesions in DWIBS and STIR sequences and were divided into training (n = 75) and test (n = 25) datasets based on the examination date. Using the training dataset, optimal feature selection was performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm, and the logistic regression model and support vector machine (SVM) classifier model were constructed with DWIBS, STIR, or a combination of DWIBS and STIR sequences to predict ALN status. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the prediction performance of radiomics models.RESULTS: For the test dataset, the logistic regression model using DWIBS, STIR, and a combination of both sequences yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.765 (95% confidence interval: 0.548-0.982), 0.801 (0.597-1.000), and 0.779 (0.567-0.992), respectively, whereas the SVM classifier model using DWIBS, STIR, and a combination of both sequences yielded an AUC of 0.765 (0.548-0.982), 0.757 (0.538-0.977), and 0.779 (0.567-0.992), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Use of machine learning models incorporating with the quantitative radiomic features derived from the DWIBS and STIR sequences can potentially predict ALN status.

T2  - AUC GEOGRAPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat satellite images (Landsat-5 for the period of 1990-2010 and Landsat-8 for the year of 2020) were used for the spatiotemporal analysis of the dynamics of the main habitats of the Kozachelaherska arena (Nyzhniodniprovsky sands, Kherson region, Ukraine). The algorithm of minimum distance of automatic k-mean clustering was used for the classification of the satellite images. Habitats were classified according to EUNIS classification principles. The analysis revealed a considerable decrease in a summary area of coniferous plantations in the period of 2000-2010. During the last two decades, the area of losses significantly exceeded the renewal area of coniferous plantations. The area of large permanent aquatic habitats in the north-east part of the arena decreased by 2.5 times in the last thirty years. The water supply of the territory is constantly decreasing, probably due to the reduction in precipitation and in the ground water level. At the same time, the area of territories under open sand doubled, the process of sand overgrowth with vegetation has slowed down, and its losses have increased. All these changes are most likely caused by the increasingly arid climate in southern Ukraine, which may, over time, lead to the replacement of habitats characteristic of sandy steppes with habitats of open sands.

AB  - In Algiers Bay, coccolithophore blooms of Holococcolithophora sphaer-oidea species were identified from in situ observations during August 2003, July-August 2013, July 2015, and July 2017. This study determines for the first time in Algiers Bay the episodes of coccolithophore blooms from 2003 to 2018 using satel-lite and in situ observations. In addition, a new coccolithophore remote sensing reflectance index (Cocco-Index) is presented, which aims to detect the presence of coccolithophore bloom from satellites in space and time. It was applied to 16 years of data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Sensor (2003-2018). From 2003 to 2018, the coccolithophore bloom appeared yearly in Algiers Bay but with a remark-able seasonal variability, developing mainly in winter and rarely in summer. This work is the first demonstration of applying a coccolithophore index for this region over such a large timescale

AB  - Finding a compatible donor for kidney transplant candidates requires overcoming immunological barriers such as human leukocyte antigens (HLA) compatibility and ABO compatibility. Emerging data suggest a role for red blood cell antigens (RCA) in renal transplant outcomes. The incidence of RCA alloimmunization is high in chronically transfused individuals, such as end stage renal disease patients, but whether antibodies to RCA can mediate renal graft rejection remains debatable. The Duffy blood group antigens (Fy) has been shown to be expressed in the kidney, among other tissues. There are some data to suggest that donor-recipient Fy mismatches may increase the risk for chronic allograft damage and that anti-Fy antibodies may be involved in renal graft rejection, however, while it is routine to screen renal transplant candidates for ABO antigens, detailed RCA phenotyping of the donor kidney is not routinely tested. In this paper, we review the current data on the role of Fy in renal transplantation and discuss the potential mechanisms of its biological function.

TI  - UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION BY GAUSSIAN RANDOM FIELDS FOR POINT-LIKE EMISSIONS FROM SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a statistical approach to estimate emissions of isolated pointlike sources by NO2 tropospheric column concentrations satellite observations. The approach is data driven; in addition to the satellite measurements it only uses available wind data and a rudimentary model for the NOx chemistry. We construct interpolated fields of the satellite observations using Gaussian random fields, which allows for a more flexible fitting of data than the more standard Gaussian plume regressions. They enable producing uncertainty quantification, even with partly obscured or missing observations. The Gaussian random field surfaces provide continuous surfaces of the satellite observations along which flux integrals are computed to simplify the problem from two-dimensional satellite observations to one-dimensional fluxes. The emission estimates are then obtained by a simple model that combines the flux and chemistry. Extensive uncertainty quantification is implemented at every step of the estimation procedure by using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods. The method is verified by simulated observations and applied to a Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data to estimate industrial nitrogen oxide emissions from the power plants of Belchatow, Poland and Yangluo, Wuhan, China. With Belchatow, we compare the obtained emission rates against reported emissions using annually reported total emissions and available power generation data.

AB  - As a mitigation target for Indonesia's Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU) Net Sink 2030, Gunung Halimun Salak National Park (GHSNP) has a high potential. However, there is a lack of data on tree species composition and vegetation cover, particularly in the traditional zone (TZ). This study aims to estimate the vegetation cover of GHSNP in 2016, 2019, and 2022, as well as tree species composition in the TZ compared to the wilderness zone ( WZ). This study used Sentinel-2 imagery and plot establishment for vegetation analysis in both zones. The most dominant class of vegetation cover in GHSNP from 2016 to 2022 is in class 5 which has highly dense vegetation. The large area class 5 increased by around 2.17% from 2016 to 2022. There were 17 species found in TZ and 24 species in WZ. Local communities are applying the traditional agroforestry of Poh-pohan (Pilea trinervia) as the main commodity and Pinus merkusii for the shade trees. P. merkusii and Maesopsis eminii are the most frequently found in TZ and WZ due to the former status of GHSNP as a production forest. Agroforestry systems can enhance biodiversity as a conservation effort and Indonesia's FOLU Net Sink 2030 actions.

AB  - The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and the space industry is a crucial step towards advancing humanity. It has the potential to create innovative technologies and services, revolutionize existing practices, and provide valuable insights to space researchers. Many private investors and government organizations possess high demand for satellite images for various reasons, including weather forecasting, global disaster management (e.g., floods, earthquakes, and tsunamis), space object location, land records, geolocations, and international shipment management. However, the traditional centralized economic model for space business is costly to implement in terms of infrastructure, deployment, security risks, ownership, and marketing of the data. Additionally, the initial acquisition of satellite images is usually retrieved in a raw format without any authentication or interpretation. Consequently, the integration of AI and the space industry has the potential to revolutionize the existing model by unlocking new avenues to monetize satellite data by introducing automated processes that are more secure and cost-effective. In this paper, we aim to use deep learning models that are capable of automatically analyzing and classifying raw satellite images into valuable and actionable formats. Furthermore, we are inspired to design a blockchain-based solution to make satellite image datasets available to private and government agencies through a user-friendly and secure marketplace. The proposed solution will focus on a decentralized socio-economic model using blockchain to increase the security of transactions. Blockchain networks facilitate the fair exchange of transactions using smart contracts that will execute and enforce agreement rules among the blockchain participants. The proposed research will mainly focus on the efficient design of smart contracts for satellite data blockchain. In addition, our integrated image quality assessment method is built and tested to accurately group high-quality satellite images into valid categories to make the trading and marketing process more efficient.

T2  - Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A combination of forces have markedly increased challenges to research-active faculty achieving sustained success. This article describes how one department at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine (UCCOM) implemented a strategic plan, the Research Initiative Supporting Excellence at the University of Cincinnati (RISE-UC), to promote the research activity of its research-active faculty, fiscal year (FY) 2011-FY 2021. RISE-UC was implemented and regularly updated to address evolving needs. RISE-UC supported faculty members pursuing research via fiscal and administrative services to grow a critical mass of investigators; establish a shared governance model; create pathways for developing physician-scientists; develop discrete and targeted internal research funding; establish an Academic Research Service (ARS) unit (as infrastructure to support research); enhance faculty member mentorship; and recognize, celebrate, and reward research success. RISE-UC was informed by shared governance and resulted in substantial increases in total size of the faculty and external funding. More than 50% of Physician-Scientist Training Program graduates are active researchers at UCCOM. The internal awards program realized a return on investment of ~16.4-fold, and total external direct cost research funds increased from ~$55,400,000 (FY 2015) to ~$114,500,000 (FY 2021). The ARS assisted in the submission of 57 grant proposals and provided services faculty members generally found very helpful or helpful. The peer-mentoring group for early-career faculty members resulted in 12 of 23 participants receiving major grant funding (≥ $100,000; spring 2017-spring 2021) from sources including National Institutes of Health awards, Department of Defense funding, Veterans Affairs funding, and foundation awards. Research recognition included ~$77,000/year in incentive payments to faculty members for grant submissions and grants awarded. RISE-UC is an example of a comprehensive approach to promote research faculty member success and may serve as a model for other institutions with similar aspirations.

TI  - Dual-Range Context Aggregation for Efficient Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although introducing self-attention mechanisms is beneficial to establish long-range dependencies and explore global context information in the task of remote sensing image semantic segmentation, it results in expensive computation and large memory cost. In this letter, we address this dilemma by proposing a lightweight dual-range context aggregation network (LDCANet) for efficient remote sensing image semantic segmentation. First, a dual-range context aggregation module (DCAM) is designed to aggregate the local features and the global semantic context acquired by convolutions and self-attention, respectively, where self-attention is implemented easily by applying two cascaded linear layers to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, a simple and lightweight decoder is employed to combine information from different levels, in which a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based efficient linear block (ELB) is proposed to yield a strong and efficient representation. Experiments conducted on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Vaihingen dataset and the Gaofen Image dataset (GID) prove that our LDCANet achieves an excellent trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. In particular, our method achieves 74.12% mean intersection over union (mIoU) on the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset and 61.42% mIoU on the GID with only 4.98-M parameter size.

AB  - As one of crucial remote sensing applications, ship classification using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has increasingly been studied in modern maritime surveillance. Nowadays, the prevailing classification paradigm for SAR ship targets is to utilize the deep network models, which presents superior performance over the traditional handcrafted feature driven methods. Of which the SAR ship classification method using densely connected convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is among the state-of-the-art. However, the general CNNs cannot fully explore the SAR ship feature representations, which limits its potentials for better classification performance. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale framework for the CNNs to further improve the ship classification performance with dual-polarization SAR images. Particularly, the convolutional feature maps from different spatial scales are fused to acquire multi-scale global representations of the dual-polarization SAR images, which are finally integrated by the group bilinear pooling operation in the classification layer and will further be processed by multiple classifiers for better network training. Extensive experiments have proved that the proposed method can improve the robustness and classification performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms on the OpenSARShip datasets.

TI  - Compounded Impacts of Global Warming and Anthropogenic Disturbances on Snowmelt in Northern Baffin Island
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fugitive dust arising from mining operations in the Arctic can be a concern to surrounding communities. The Mary River Mine operation on northwest Baffin Island in the Qikiqtani region, Nunavut, is one example. Yet, the short and long-term impacts of fugitive dust remain poorly understood. Dust lowers snow albedo which can contribute to early snowmelt. This influences the spring snowmelt freshet period, significant to the land-atmosphere interactions, hydrology, ecology, and socioeconomic activities in the Arctic. Here, we map dust extents indicated by snow discoloration and examine for areas of early snowmelt using a 21-year MODIS time series snow cover product in 2000-2020. We found an episode of dust plume extended far beyond the reference dust sampler sites from where Nil dustfall is detected. A snow albedo decrease of 0.014 was seen more than 60 km away from the mine site. Incidents of early snowmelt existed extensively and progressively prior to the Mary River Mine operations; however, localized and even earlier snowmelt also appear around Mine's operations; we estimated that the snow-off date was advanced by one week and three weeks for the background, and areas around the Mine facilities, respectively, during the 21-year period. Furthermore, the area increase in early snowmelt around the Mine facilities correlates to ore production growth. This study demonstrates rapid changes in early snowmelt beyond observed regional trends when additional drivers are introduced.

TI  - Assessment of ERA5 Near-Surface Air Temperatures Over Global Oceans by Combining MODIS Sea Surface Temperature Products and In-Situ Observations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis dataset and has been widely used in climate change analysis and land surface process simulations. However, few assessments have been conducted across the entire ocean for this dataset till now. The motivation of this study is to utilize the in-situ observations and remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) products to propose a new approach to evaluate the precision of ERA5 air temperature over the whole ocean. First, a stacked multilayer perceptron regressor model was employed to map global marine air temperature (MAT) by incorporating in-situ records into moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST products. Second, a monthly MAT dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees was developed and validated for the assessment of ERA5 air temperature particularly in the regions where only satellite observations are available. It demonstrates that the quality of estimated MAT (RMSE = 1.62 degrees C, Bias = 0.03 degrees C) is evidently high in 80.3% of the observation stations, which is much better than that of averaged SST (RMSE = 2.29 degrees C, Bias = 1.14 degrees C). Thus, the estimated MAT is credible enough to be employed to assess ERA5 air temperature both at the grid and regional scale. Finally, the ERA5 air temperature was compared and validated with the estimated MAT temporally and spatially. The further study suggested that estimated MAT and ERA5 air temperature basically maintain consistency in expressing persistent warming, particularly in the western Pacific, western Atlantic, and northern Indian Ocean. In addition, the trend of ERA5 air temperature during 50 degrees S-50 degrees N reaches 0.016 +/- 0.003 degrees C/yr, which is similar to that of estimated MAT (0.017 +/- 0.002 degrees C/yr) during 2003-2021.

T2  - Harvard Dataverse

C8  - 2
AB  - Agriculture is an undeniable factor in conflict and cooperation over international river basins. Yet, due to lack of data on agricultural land for each country within specific international river basins, comparatively few studies have systematically discussed and empirically investigated the role of agriculture in international water conflict and cooperation. This study contributes to filling this gap by using remotely sensed data of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover from 2001 to 2007. The results suggest that agriculture has an important role in international water conflicts. Besides, the findings also indicate that upstream countries with larger area of agricultural land in themselves are not enough to trigger conflict over international river basins. Rather, its impact is constrained by agricultural land owned by downstream countries. This study highlights the importance of agriculture in international river basins, which could benefit governance of international freshwater resources.

M3  - Article
AB  - The advanced geosynchronous radiation imager (AGRI) aboard the Chinese Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite can provide operational hourly sea surface temperature (SST) product. However, the temporal and spatial variation of the errors for this product is still unclear. In this article, FY-4A/AGRI SST is evaluated using the in situ SST from 2019-2021, and a cumulative distribution function matching method is adopted to reduce the errors. Statistical results show that the mean bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of FY-4A/AGRI SST are -037 degrees C and 0.98 degrees C, the median and robust standard deviation (RSD) are -0.30 degrees C and 0.90 degrees C. The variations in daily and monthly errors are large and there are no prominent seasonal variations during the period analyzed. There are negative biases exceeding -1.0 degrees C in low-mid latitude regions and larger positive biases in southern high latitude region. There are dependencies of satellite SST minus in situ SST on satellite zenith angle and on SST itself. After the bias correction, the bias and RMSE are reduced to -0.02 degrees C and 0.72 degrees C, and the median and RSD are reduced to 0.00 degrees C and 0.60 degrees C. On the time scale, the fluctuation ranges of bias and median are smaller. The difference of satellite SST minus in situ SST can reflect the diurnal variation of SST. The biases are generally within +/- 0.2 degrees C in full disk. The error dependencies on satellite zenith angle and SST are also greatly reduced.

TI  - Sensitivity Analysis of Microwave Spectrometer for Atmospheric Temperature and Humidity Sounding on the New Generation Fengyun Satellite
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical profiles, spatiotemporal distribution, and trends of temperature and humidity in the middle atmosphere are significant for numerical weather prediction and the analysis of global climate change. To better design and apply spaceborne microwave spectrometer on the new generation Fengyun satellite, the sensitivities of the spectrometers at 22.235, 50-60, 118.75, 183.31, 325.153, 380.33, 424.77, 448.0, and 556.94 GHz are analyzed, respectively. Qpack2 included in the atmospheric radiative transfer simulator is used. The results show that the retrieval accuracy of the 50.0-60.0 GHz spectrometer is obviously better than other spectrometers, and the effective detection height (EDH) is the highest, reaching 0.233 hPa. The humidity profiles bigger than 500 hPa are well detected by the seven channels of the Humidity and Temperature Profiler or 22.0-32.0 GHz spectrometer. The retrieval accuracy is better than 6%, which greatly improves the retrieval performance of humidity profiles in the lower troposphere over the sea. In addition, this frequency band is not affected by errors in sea surface temperature or wind speed. The humidity profiles over the sea and land in the middle atmosphere under clear-sky and cloudy-sky conditions are well detected by the 183.31 and 556.94 GHz spectrometer. The EDH can be increased to 1.14 hPa by the 556.94 GHz spectrometer. In the design and application of future spaceborne microwave spectrometers for temperature and humidity profiles detection, the spectrometers mentioned previously are good candidates, and the parameter configuration of these spectrometers can be used as a reference.

TI  - National Scale Maize Yield Estimation by Integrating Multiple Spectral Indexes and Temporal Aggregation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize yield in China accounts for more than one-fourth of the global maize yield, but it is challenged by frequent extreme weather and increasing food demand. Accurate and timely estimation of maize yield is of great significance to crop management and food security. Commonly applied vegetation indexes (VIs) are mainly used in crop yield estimation as they can reflect the greenness of vegetation. However, the environmental pressures of crop growth and development are difficult to monitor and evaluate. Indexes for water content, pigment content, nutrient elements and biomass have been developed to indirectly explain the influencing factors of yield, with extant studies mainly assessing VIs, climate and water content factors. Only a few studies have attempted to systematically evaluate the sensitivity of these indexes. The sensitivity of the spectral indexes, combined indexes and climate factors and the effect of temporal aggregation data need to be evaluated. Thus, this study proposes a novel yield evaluation method for integrating multiple spectral indexes and temporal aggregation data. In particular, spectral indexes were calculated by integrating publicly available data (remote sensing images and climate data) from the Google Earth Engine platform, and county-level maize yields in China from 2015 to 2019 were estimated using a random forest model. Results showed that the normalized moisture difference index (NMDI) is the index most sensitive to yield estimation. Furthermore, the potential of adopting the combined indexes, especially NMDI_NDNI, was verified. Compared with the whole-growth period data and the eight-day time series, the vegetative growth period and the reproductive growth period data were more sensitive to yield estimation. The maize yield in China can be estimated by integrating multiple spectral indexes into the indexes for the vegetative and reproductive growth periods. The obtained R-2 of maize yield estimation reached 0.8. This study can provide feature knowledge and references for index assessments for yield estimation research.

AB  - The article develops the theoretical and methodological foundations of distance learning in the system of continuous education and its characteristic features (flexibility, modularity, parallelism, long-range action, asynchrony, mass character, economic efficiency, the changed role of the teacher, the new role and activity of the student, specialized control of the learning process, the use of modern teaching aids, sociality, internationality); the differences between distance learning and the traditional full-time form are established (in the distance learning system, the student is the customer of knowledge; the information and educational environment of distance learning is much wider, but less than traditional full-time education, regulates the behavior of participants in the pedagogical process and disciplines students to a greater extent); the specifics of the personal interaction of participants in the distance learning process and the management of distance learning processes (human studies, psychophysical, socio-psychological aspects predominate in it) are revealed; carrying out educational work in the conditions of remote betrothal puts forward the axiological approach in the first place; resolved a set of issues related to the introduction of a distance learning system into real pedagogical practice (its social, worldview, value, methodological, legal, financial, economic, organizational, didactic, technological, psychological, applied and educational aspects); organizational forms of distance learning are defined (traditional (correspondence); with fragmentary use of information and communication technologies; electronic; combined).

TI  - Impact of Iran's Forest Nationalization Law on Forest Cover Changes over Six Decades: A Case Study of a Zagros Sparse Coppice Oak Forest
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest nationalization policies in developing countries have often led to a reduction in local forest ownership rights and short- or long-term exploitative behaviors of stakeholders. The purpose of this research is to quantify the effect of Iran's Forest Nationalization Law (FNL) in a part of Zagros Forest over a 68-year time period (1955-2022) using 1955 historical aerial photos, 1968 Corona spy satellite photography, and classification of multi-temporal Landsat satellite images. A past classification change detection technique was used to identify the extent and the pattern of land use changes in time. For this purpose, six periods were defined, to cover the time before and after the implementation of FNL. A 0.27% deforestation trend was identified over the period after the FNL. Dense and open forested area has decreased from 7175.62 ha and 68,927.46 ha in 1955 to 5664.26 ha and 59,223.38 ha in 2022. The FNL brought decisive changes in the legal and forest management systems at the state level, mainly by giving their ownership to the state. Accordingly, the FNL and the related conservation plans have not fully succeeded in protecting, rehabilitating, recovering, and developing the sparse Zagros Forest ecosystems, as their most important goals.

TI  - Thomas Jefferson and Politics: "A game where principles are the stake"
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AMERICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Thomas Jefferson's fame as an advocate of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, equal rights of men, religious freedom, and democracy has been frequently questioned. For many scholars, his racist statements, his scant concern for women's rights, his apparently unrealistic anti-slavery policies, and his anti-Federalist politics suffice as proof of the very opposite of his reputation. This article argues that politics can be viewed as the centerpiece of Jefferson's worldview, according to which all purposes needed to be brought into compliance, to the effect that one ended up with different politics for advocating democratic institutions, for progressive science, for personal self-development, and for socioeconomic issues, including slavery. The never-ending process of creating policies for bettering American society also gave politics its own character as a moral concept.

TI  - Das kutane Plattenepithelkarzinom: Aktueller Stand, Perspektiven und offene Fragen.
T2  - Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology : JDDG
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Das Plattenepithelkarzinom (PEK) der Haut ist eine der haufigsten Krebsarten in hellhautigen Bevolkerungsgruppen und umfasst 20% aller Hauttumoren. Seit 2019 liegt eine S3-Leitlinie des deutschen Leitlinienprogramms Onkologie vor, die 2022 aktualisiert wurde. Die Diagnose des PEK basiert auf der klinischen Untersuchung. Exzision und histologische Sicherung sind bei allen klinisch verdachtigen Lasionen erforderlich, um eine prognostische Einschatzung und korrekte Behandlung zu ermoglichen. Die Therapie der ersten Wahl ist die vollstandige Exzision mit histologischer Schnittrandkontrolle. Bei kutanen PEK mit Risikofaktoren wie einer Tumordicke >6mm kann eine Sentinel-Lymphknotenbiopsie durchgefuhrt werden, derzeit gibt es aber keine klare Evidenz bezuglich ihrer prognostischen und therapeutischen Bedeutung. Eine adjuvante Radiatio kann bei hohem Rezidivrisiko erwogen werden. Bei fortgeschrittenem PEK ist der Immuncheckpoint-Inhibitor Cemiplimab zugelassen und stellt die Therapie der ersten Wahl dar. Bei Kontraindikationen konnen Chemotherapeutika, EGFR-Inhibitoren oder eine palliative Radiatio eingesetzt werden. Die Nachsorge sollte risikoadaptiert stattfinden und schlieSSt eine dermatologische Kontrolle erganzt um Ultraschalluntersuchungen bei Hochrisikopatienten ein. Ein hoher Forschungsbedarf besteht weiterhin fur Organtransplantierte, bei hamatologischen Begleiterkrankungen und fur Tumoren, die eine primare oder erworbene Resistenz gegenuber Immuntherapien zeigen. Aktuelle Entwicklungen umfassen neue Kombinationen, intralasionale Therapien allein oder in Kombination mit Immuncheckpoint-Inhibitoren sowie neoadjuvante Ansatze.

TI  - lakeCoSTR: A tool to facilitate use of Landsat Collection 2 to estimate lake surface water temperatures
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although remote sensing of lake surface water temperature has been ongoing for decades and has led to important discoveries regarding the warming of lake surface temperature in some regions, the ability to access and use remote sensing data is still primarily limited to remote sensing experts. Effective use of remote sensing data involves technical skills in coding (often in multiple programming languages), application of appropriate atmospheric corrections, and integrating spatially heterogeneous remote sensing data with in situ data obtained at specific geographic locations. To improve access to remote sensing data and broaden the understanding of changes in lake surface water temperature over the past four decades, we created lakeCoSTR (lake Collection 2 Surface Temperature Retrieval), a user-friendly, cloud-based script that gives ecologists lacking specialized training in remote sensing the ability to access the Landsat Collection 2 temperature estimates for lakes with a surface area of at least 0.4 ha. Additionally, if in situ data are provided, a paired dataset can be created within the tool. To demonstrate lakeCoSTR, we retrieved surface water temperature data for a lake with a long monitoring history, Lake Sunapee, NH, USA, and compared long-term surface temperature trends between data obtained via lakeCoSTR and in situ measurements. When compared with Landsat Collection 1 temperature estimates derived from a single-channel algorithm, the Landsat Collection 2 data from lakeCoSTR required no calibration to in situ data. This suggests that lakeCoSTR can be used to document temporal trends in lakes and to reprocess analyses that relied on Collection 1 data. From 1983 until 2020, remotely sensed surface water temperature estimates at Lake Sunapee increased by 0.07-0.09 degrees C year( -1) during July and August, a trend that agreed with long-term in situ record. As climate change continues to impact freshwater systems, a better understanding of long-term temperature data will be vital. Remotely sensed data, like those acquired using lakeCoSTR, may provide a window into temperature trends for lakes.

T2  - American journal of surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between surgical delay and outcomes for patients with cutaneous melanoma is understudied. The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of surgical delay on regional nodal involvement and mortality in patients with cutaneous melanoma.METHODS: Retrospective study of patients diagnosed with clinically node-negative invasive cutaneous melanoma from 2004 to 2018. Outcomes included regional lymph node disease and overall survival. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazards models were constructed to adjust for pertinent clinical factors.RESULTS: Of 423,001 patients, 21.8% experienced a surgical delay (≥45 days). These patients were more likely to have nodal involvement (OR1.09; P​=​0.01). Surgical delay (HR1.14; P​<​0.001), Black race (HR1.34; P​=​0.002), and Medicaid (HR1.92; P​<​0.001) were associated with lower survival. Patients treated at academic/research (HR0.87; P​<​0.001) or integrated network cancer programs (HR0.89; P​=​0.001) had improve survival.CONCLUSIONS: Surgical delay was frequent and resulted in higher rates of lymph node involvement and decreased overall survival.

TI  - Rapid expansion of irrigated agriculture in the Senegal River Valley following the 2008 food price crisis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of irrigated croplands throughout the 20th century boosted global agricultural productivity, yet limited improvement occurred in sub-Saharan Africa where many irrigation schemes and policies under-delivered. We mapped the distribution of croplands under active irrigation between 1986 and 2020 for one of Africa's largest and most important transboundary river basins-the Senegal River Valley; using Landsat imagery with a random forest classifier and hidden Markov Model. We document two distinct epochs of irrigation development. Initially, a period of stagnation where less than 900 ha yr(-1) was added, lasting until 2008. Followed by a boom phase of rapidly expanding intensively irrigated production with similar to 9,000 ha yr(-1) added for the last 12 years. These epochs overlap with national agricultural policy frameworks: the 1980s laissez-faire policies limited state involvement in agriculture and promoted Asian imports; followed by a more interventionist period focused on promoting domestic production following the food price crisis of 2008.

AB  - This paper examines changes of non-orthogonality in 40 consumer-grade, triaxial MEMS gyroscopes across three different environmental conditions: Soldering, temperature and accelerated lifetime testing. We find that through all three treatments, similar correlations of yx non-orthogonality change to z-axis quadrature change appear. We attribute the behavior to a common susceptibility to mechanical stress. Consequently, we evaluate the feasibility of an in-run, active compensation of non-orthogonality using only the sensor-internal quadrature signal. Improved yx non-orthogonalities reach stability between +/- 0.021% and +/- 0.040% with a reduction of -73% across soldering, up to -69% across temperature and -55% across lifetime. We also demonstrate that the non-orthogonality changes of the devices across each of the three environmental conditions do not correlate to each other. It is furthermore shown, that the other two non-orthogonalities, zx and zy, offer excellent stability below +/- 0.015% across temperature solely by design.

TI  - THE FEATURES OF FORMING THE ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF A PERSON
T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, people have faced a severe threat of an ecological catastrophe, primarily due to the conflict between culture and the laws of nature. Society has exceeded the capabilities of the biosphere. In this context, there is a need to make all aspects of social life more environmentally friendly, including developing and implementing resource-saving and waste-free technologies, which requires the active participation of ecologically conscious persons. The environment must be provided with the necessary resources for carrying out socially significant work. Knowledge of the interactions between society and the environment, understanding the immediate and long-term consequences of natural changes, appreciation, conservation of natural resources, and love for nature are essential. Technological progress has improved people's financial lives, but unfortunately, it has caused significant damage to the entire biosphere. In these conditions, the understanding of contradictions arising in the "nature-conscious society" sphere lags behind the constant growth of conflicts. Resolving the ecological problems of the current stage of social development requires a new worldview and the formation of people's thinking and attitudes toward the major issues of human life. The formation of this ideology allows people to recognize their honesty and naturalness and transform consumer relations into sustainable consumption. Despite society's attempts to reflect its actions against nature, people's perceptions of the world are still distorted, their natural behavior is ecologically abnormal, and people are not yet ready to actively work in harmony with nature. Therefore, the relevance of the research topic is determined by the need for a deep and comprehensive analysis of information on the formation of ecological consciousness in the context of natural social development. Theoretical research enables the creation of a broad concept of environmental consciousness and the revelation of its nature, functions, and role in the development of the environment. The article hypothesizes that the formation of ecological consciousness depends on the person's age. Based on a sociological study conducted by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation on behalf of the Environmental Law Association, problems of forming ecological consciousness and age-specific features of ecological perception were identified. As a result, forms and methods of creating ecological consciousness for different age groups were developed: children (preschoolers), adolescents (schoolchildren and students), and adults. The article emphasizes the necessity of educational and awareness-raising activities among the people of each age group to form ecological consciousness effectively.

AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2:5) pollution is a serious problem in Vietnam, especially in mega-cities such as Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City. High levels of PM2:5 concentration have negative impacts on public health even if the exposure is short-term. New advancements in satellite observations can capture a lot of detailed information on air quality. Via proper processing methods, those satellite observations can produce high quality PM2:5 concentration maps that facilitates PM2:5 impact assessment and mitigation measures at national and local scales. In this paper, we present an application service, called Pollution Observation Platform on GIS, or POPGIS, that collects inputs from multiple satellite data sources and applies new research techniques in satellite-based PM2:5 concentration estimation and presents near real-time results to users. The system is also designed for data sharing and can be used for analysis and re-evaluation of PM2:5 distribution maps.

TI  - The Impact of Point-of-Care Testing for Influenza on Antimicrobial Stewardship (PIAMS) in UK Primary Care: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Molecular point-of-care testing (POCT) used in primary care can inform whether a patient presenting with an acute respiratory infection has influenza. A confirmed clinical diagnosis, particularly early in the disease, could inform better antimicrobial stewardship. Social distancing and lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic have disturbed previous patterns of influenza infections in 2021. However, data from samples taken in the last quarter of 2022 suggest that influenza represents 36% of sentinel network positive virology, compared with 24% for respiratory syncytial virus. Problems with integration into the clinical workflow is a known barrier to incorporating technology into routine care.Objective: This study aims to report the impact of POCT for influenza on antimicrobial prescribing in primary care. We will additionally describe severe outcomes of infection (hospitalization and mortality) and how POCT is integrated into primary care workflows.Methods: The impact of POCT for influenza on antimicrobial stewardship (PIAMS) in UK primary care is an observational study being conducted between December 2022 and May 2023 and involving 10 practices that contribute data to the English sentinel network. Up to 1000 people who present to participating practices with respiratory symptoms will be swabbed and tested with a rapid molecular POCT analyzer in the practice. Antimicrobial prescribing and other study outcomes will be collected by linking information from the POCT analyzer with data from the patient's computerized medical record. We will collect data on how POCT is incorporated into practice using data flow diagrams, unified modeling language use case diagrams, and Business Process Modeling Notation.Results: We will present the crude and adjusted odds of antimicrobial prescribing (all antibiotics and antivirals) given a POCT diagnosis of influenza, stratifying by whether individuals have a respiratory or other relevant diagnosis (eg, bronchiectasis). We will also present the rates of hospital referrals and deaths related to influenza infection in PIAMS study practices compared with a set of matched practices in the sentinel network and the rest of the network. We will describe any difference in implementation models in terms of staff involved and workflow.Conclusions: This study will generate data on the impact of POCT testing for influenza in primary care as well as help to inform about the feasibility of incorporating POCT into primary care workflows. It will inform the design of future larger studies about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of POCT to improve antimicrobial stewardship and any impact on severe outcomes.

TI  - Data for: Considerations for fitting occupancy models to data from eBird and similar volunteer-collected data
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - An occupancy model makes use of data that are structured as sets of repeated visits to each of many sites, in order estimate the actual probability of occupancy (i.e., proportion of occupied sites) after correcting for imperfect detection using the information contained in the sets of repeated observations. We explore the conditions under which preexisting, volunteer-collected data from the citizen science project eBird can be used for fitting occupancy models. The data archived here are used to explore two ways in which the single-visit records could be used in occupancy models. First, we use empirical data contained within this archive to assess the potential for space-for-time substitution: aggregating single-visit records from different locations within a region into pseudo-repeat visits. The archived data are used to illustrate that the locations chosen for data collection by observers were not always representative of the habitat in the surrounding area, which would lead to biased estimates of occupancy probabilities when using space-for-time substitution. Second, create a large set of simulated data (output from the simulations contained in this archive) that we used to explore the utility of including data from single-visit records to supplement sets of repeated-visit data. All data files can be viewed as plain text within a text editor, although the archived tables are better viewed within computer programs designed to display and manipulate tabular data. The archived data are almost all comma-delimited value (.csv) tables, with one tab-delimited value (.txt) table. In our use of these data we have read them into the statistical software R, and at least one aspect of the format of some of the data tables is the use of the letters "NA" to denote missing values as is the convention in R.Funding provided by: National Science FoundationCrossref Funder Registry ID: https://doi.org/10.13039/100000001Award Number: ICER-1927646 The seven data files archived are of three different types: Raw data: records of bird watching events in which observations of wild bird were made by volunteer participants in eBird and entered into eBird's database. These data have not undergone subsequent processes, aside from being associated with identifier variables that can be used to connect records of observations made at the same locations or by the same observers. Combination and derivation from primary data: information from eBird observation events (location, date, time, observer effort) are combined with summaries of landcover in the immediate area surrounding each location of an eBird observation. The landcover information is derived from the MODIS MCD12Q1v006 data product, with derived estimates of landcover percentages calculated by summarizing information from multiple pixels within the immediate areas around all locations of eBird observations. Simulation output: records of parameter estimates and their precision from occupancy models fit to large numbers of sets of simulated data, with the goal of understanding how variation in conditions (the conditions examined in the paper with which the data are associated) affected the accuracy and precision with which detection and occupancy probabilities were estimated. The simulated study was needed because true detection probability and true occupancy probability are never known for empirical data.

T2  - ZUCHTUNGSKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal diseases seem to be spreading more than ever. Globalization, more and more people on earth who are penetrating ever more remote regions and the changes in ecosystems caused by climate change are fueling this process. The Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI), Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, conducts research on the health and well-being of food-producing animals and on protecting people from infections that can be transmitted between animals and humans. The FLI is developing preventive measures, trying to establish better and faster diagnostics and creating the basis for modern control strategies to prevent the development and/or spread of viral infections. The prevention of the cross-border spread of animal diseases is increasingly in focus. Several factors, including global human mobility, trade and climate change, may impact emerging diseases. Recent examples of disease outbreaks in Europe illustrate the risks. Examples are here: BTV 8, Schmallenberg virus, West Nile fever, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 and H7N7. The risk cannot be reduced to zero as outbreak predictability is limited, but close monitoring of the global animal health situation, improved surveillance (early detection, syndrome, risk-based surveillance, sentinel herds and citizen science) can help reduce the risks and limit the extent of outbreaks. The preservation of habitats and biodiversity are further protective measures that can be implemented.

TI  - Multi-Task Learning for Building Extraction and Change Detection from Remote Sensing Images
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Building extraction (BE) and change detection (CD) from remote sensing (RS) imagery are significant yet highly challenging tasks with substantial application potential in urban management. Learning representative multi-scale features from RS images is a crucial step toward practical BE and CD solutions, as in other DL-based applications. To better exploit the available labeled training data for representation learning, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) network for simultaneous BE and CD, comprising the state-of-the-art (SOTA) powerful Swin transformer as a shared backbone network and multiple heads for predicting building labels and changes. Using the popular CD dataset the Wuhan University building change detection dataset (WHU-CD), we benchmarked detailed designs of the MTL network, including backbone and pre-training choices. With a selected optimal setting, the intersection over union (IoU) score was improved from 70 to 81 for the WHU-CD. The experimental results of different settings demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed MTL method. In particular, we achieved top scores in BE and CD from optical images in the 2021 Gaofen Challenge. Our method also shows transferable performance on an unseen CD dataset, indicating high label efficiency.

TI  - Object-based characterization of vegetation heterogeneity with sentinel images proves efficient in a highly human-influenced National Park of Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest monitoring requires more automated systems to analyze high ecosystem heterogeneity. The traditional pixel-based detection method has proven to be less and less effective. A novel change detection method is therefore proposed to detect changes in forest cover using satellite images at very high spatial resolution. This is object-oriented classification, which groups pixels into interpreted objects, based on their spectral values, spatial, and textural properties. Using sentinel and Lansat images, we tested for the first time in the West African rainforest zone the effectiveness of this method for better detection, delineation, and analysis of land use and occupation types. The mean shift algorithm was used in both the segmentation and classification processes. Next, we compared the proposed object-oriented method with a pixel-based image classification detection method by implementing both methods under the same conditions. High detection accuracy (> 90%) and an overall Kappa greater than 0.90 were obtained by the object-oriented method, which is about 20% higher than the pixel-based method. The object-based method was free of salt and pepper effects and was less prone to image misregistration in terms of change detection accuracy and mapping results. This study demonstrates that the object-based classifier is a much better approach than the classical pixel-based classifier. In addition, it shows the problems of detecting heterogeneous landscapes and explains the observed confusions between the types of vegetation formations specific to tropical wetlands. The results obtained are encouraging and the contribution of high-resolution images and the object-based method to better discrimination of tropical wetland vegetation is discussed.

TI  - Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Primary Health Care for Chronic Conditions in Canada: Protocol for a Retrospective Pre-Post Study Using National Practice-Based Research Network Data
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, there have been concerns that interruptions to the health care system may have led to changes in primary care, especially for care of chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart failure. Such changes may have longer term implications for population health. Objective: This study aims to describe the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on indicators of primary care access, comprehensiveness, and appropriateness among adult patients, as well as on specific indictors of chronic conditions. Additionally, this study aims to determine whether any identified changes were associated with patient sociodemographic characteristics and multimorbidity. Methods: This is a retrospective, single-arm, pre-post study using Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) data. CPCSSN is a research network supported by a primary care electronic medical record database, comprising over 1500 physicians and nearly 2 million patients. We are examining changes in care (eg, frequency of contacts, laboratory tests and investigations, referrals, medications prescribed, etc) among adults. We will also examine indicators specific to evidence-based recommendations for care in patients with diabetes and those with heart failure. We will compare rates of outcomes during key periods of the pandemic between March 13, 2020, and December 31, 2022, with equal time periods before the pandemic. Differences will be examined among specific subgroups of adults, including by decade of age, number of comorbidities, and socioeconomic status. Regression models appropriate to outcome distributions will be used to estimate changes, adjusting for potential confounders. This analysis is part of a mixed-methods study with a qualitative component investigating how patients with diabetes with or without concurrent heart failure perceived the impact of the pandemic on access to primary care and health care-related decisions. This study was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (14782-C). Results: The start date of this study was October 5, 2022, and the prospective end date is January 31, 2024. As of May 2023, the study cohort (n=875,934) is defined, data cleaning is complete, and exploratory analyses have begun. Extended analyses using 2022 data are planned once the new data becomes available. We will disseminate results through peer-reviewed publications and academic conference, as well as creating evidence briefs, infographics, and a video for policy maker and patient audiences. Conclusions: This study will investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in the provision of primary care in Canada and whether these potential changes have led to gaps in care. This study will also identify patient-level characteristics associated with changes in care patterns across the COVID-19 pandemic. Indicators specific to chronic conditions, namely diabetes and heart failure, will also be explored to determine whether there were changes in care of these conditions.

TI  - Elevation Model Mosaicking From Coregistration, Adjustment, and Median of Stacks (CAMS)
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A large and growing volume of repeat digital elevation models (DEMs) obtained from multiple spaceborne sensors enables high-resolution mapping of the Earth's surface at continental scales. Mosaicking of individual DEMs to form a continuous surface is challenging due to variability data quality and positional accuracy, all of which can result in artifacts. Presented is a method for efficiently mosaicking sets of repeat, overlapping DEMs using their pairwise, translational offsets to remove poor quality DEMs and optimize their alignment prior to merging. The coregistration, adjustment, and median of stacks (CAMS) approach is tested by mosaicking a set of 2-m resolution DEMs created from WorldView (WV) stereoscopic imagery and comparing the result to light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. CAMS produces a mosaic of substantially higher quality and accuracy than that obtained from the median of all overlapping DEMS, as commonly performed for mosaicking satellite-derived DEMs. The method requires no sensor-specific information or ground control, making it applicable for large-area mosaic production using multiple datasets.

TI  - The influence of snow cover on Ozone Monitor Instrument formaldehyde observations
T2  - ATMOSFERA
M3  - Article
AB  - Formaldehyde (HCHO) is measured from space using backscattered ultraviolet sun-light. Because of HCHO's short lifetime, space-based observations of HCHO can serve as a proxy for volatile organic compounds, helping to characterize their global emissions and distributions. HCHO satellite observations rely on air mass factor (AMF) calculations to transform fitted slant columns into vertical column densities (VCD's). Most HCHO satellite products do not explicitly consider the presence of snow on the ground during the calculation of AMFs. In this study, we leverage information from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), MODIS snow cover information, and the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System to evaluate the impact of ground snow on Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) HCHO retrievals. We focus our analysis on the year 2005. We compare AMFs computed using daily MODIS BRDF to AMFs computed using OMI's surface reflectance climatology, the baseline for NASA's OMHCHO product. Over snow-covered regions, both sets of AMFs show significant differences. We observe two different behaviors. Regions with permanent snow cover (Greenland and Antarctica) show smaller AMFs calculated with MODIS BRDF than with the OMI climatology resulting in a 6% median annual increase of HCHO VCDs. Over regions with seasonal snow cover, the situation is more complex with more variability in the differences during the year. For example, a February 2005 case study over Europe shows that the NASA OMHCHO VCDs (calculated using the OMI Lambertian climatology) are on average 16% larger than HCHO columns retrieved using daily MODIS BRDF information.

AB  - The mud receiving area is an important sand storage area for dredging sea sand reclamation and sand-dumping in the waterway. The sediment accumulation area generated in the process of sand dumping and sand storage has an impact on the surrounding transportation facilities and the normal use of the entire sand storage area. From 6 August 2021 to 9 May 2022, The Sentinel-1A 24-view SLC data covering the sludge area were used to monitor the safety around the seawall road by InSAR technology. Synthetic aperture radar differential interferometry (Differential InSAR, D-InSAR) technology can obtain surface micro deformation information through single-time differential interference processing, mainly used for sudden surface deformation. D-InSAR technology detected five accumulation areas with a thickness of more than 10 cm near the seawall road, earth embankment, and cofferdam, and TS-InSAR (Time series InSAR) technology was used to retrieve the deformation of the surrounding road. The road settlement is a slight settlement distributed between +/- 5 mm/a. This paper uses the leveling results combined with variance analysis to verify the fusion of different TS-InSAR methods while considering the area of data loss due to causes such as loss of coherence. This paper also considers the common ground continuity and uses the adjacent interpolation and bilinear interpolation algorithm to improve knowledge of the study area seawall road and the surrounding soil embankment deformation data of the road. Compared with the leveling data, the difference between the missing data and the leveling data after interpolation is stable at about 1-7 mm, which increases the risk level of part of the road which needs to be maintained. It provides a reference method to make up for the missing data caused by ground incoherence.

TI  - Model-Based Polarimetric Target Decomposition With Power Redistribution for Urban Areas
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric decomposition of oriented buildings is challenging due to their variable orientation angles and structures. Both vegetated and oriented built-up areas generate the HV component namely cross-polarized scattering, leading to an overestimation of volume scattering (OVS). It can cause misinterpretation of the scattering mechanisms between oriented built-up and vegetated areas. In this article, we use a pure volume scattering model designed for completely random scattering to describe the scattering of vegetated areas. At the same time, a new urban revised rate is proposed by considering the rotated dihedral model and introducing polarimetric asymmetry, which can distinguish different areas and reduce OVS in urban areas through power transfer strategy. Then, a new model-based polarimetric target decomposition with power redistribution for urban areas is proposed. The performance of our proposed method is verified by RADARSAT-2 C-band and UAVSAR L-band data. The results show that our method can not only better characterize the scattering of oriented buildings compared to previous methods but also maintain the scattering power of natural areas. It can alleviate the scattering misinterpretation problem between oriented built-up and natural areas.

TI  - Pollen in the Baltic Sea as viewed from space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-sensor satellite images often show recurrent image slicks in the Baltic Sea. Based on historical reports, laboratory experiments, and spectral diagnostics, these image slicks are determined to be caused by pine (Pinus sylvestris) pollen aggregations as opposed to surface scums of cyanobacteria or other floating matters. This attribution is because the reflectance spectral shapes of these image slicks resemble those of pollen grains, which are all different from other floating matters. They all show rapid reflectance increase from -400 to -500 nm, beyond which the reflectance shape appears to plateau. During the 22-year period of 2000-2021, satellite images indicated large amounts of pollen grains in 14 years, with the earliest day being May 10 (in 2000) and the latest day being June 16 (in 2006). The longest duration in a single year is 22 days, from May 12 to June 2 of 2018. The waters containing pollen grains have expanded significantly in recent years, encompassing nearly the entire Baltic Sea. Because pollen grains contain a significant amount of carbon and have distinctive optical properties from other particles, these findings have significant implications on carbon sequestration, marine ecology, biooptics, ocean color calibration/validation, and remote sensing of marine debris.

TI  - Warming Has Accelerated the Melting of Glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau, but the Debris-Covered Glaciers Are Rapidly Expanding
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier changes on the Tibetan Plateau are of great importance for regional climate and hydrology and even global ecological changes. It is urgent to understand the effect of climate warming on both clean and debris-covered glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau. This study used the double RF method and Landsat series images to extract clean glaciers and debris-covered glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau from 1985 to 2020 and analyzed their temporal and spatial changes under the background of climate change. The total area of glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau showed a retreating trend from 1985 to 2020, with an average retreat rate of -0.5 % yr(-1). The area of clean glaciers showed a significant retreating trend, with a retreat rate of -0.55 % yr(-1). The area of debris-covered glaciers showed an expanding trend, with an expanding rate of 0.62 % yr(-1). The clean glaciers retreated faster in the southeast and slower in the northwest, while the debris-covered glaciers expanded in most basins. The debris-covered glaciers were generally located at lower elevation areas than those of the clean glaciers. The slopes of clean glaciers were mainly in the range of 0-50 degrees, while the slopes of debris-covered glaciers were mainly in the range of 0-30 degrees. Climate warming was a main driver of glacier change. The clean glacier area was correlated negatively with average temperature in summer and positively with average precipitation in winter, while the debris-covered glacier area was correlated positively with both. The results of the study may provide a basis for scientific management of glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau in the context of climate warming.

TI  - Coupling dynamic wave equation with land surface model and application to Zhengzhou "7•20" rainstorm
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - The reasonable parameterization of runoff processes for complex terrain is important for increasing the accuracy of land surface models. In this study, a two-dimensional dynamic wave equation was applied to improve the runoff calculations in the Noah-Multiparameterization Land Surface Model (Noah-MP), and the water exchange between two-dimensional horizontal grids was added to the original one-dimensional Noah-MP scheme of the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. The grid slope was adopted in the dynamic wave equation to calculate the confluence process, and the water depth was introduced to the slope calculation to update the catchment path in real time. The improved Noah-MP model (called the Noah-MP-OF) focuses on the influence of the confluence process at the land-surface-model scale. The improved Noah-MP model was used to simulate the hydrological process during the Zhengzhou "7 center dot 20" rainstorm, which produced the most severe flood since 1960. The results show that the improved scheme can more accurately capture the temporal and spatial evolution of overland flow, water depth, and soil moisture over complex terrain. The spatial distribution of the simulated water depth was generally consistent with that monitored by the Gaofen-3 satellite remote sensing. The inflow and accumulation of overland flow in the low-lying region simulated by the original scheme are not evident; however, the new scheme depicts the features of overland flow: Gathering in the low-lying region and in Zhengzhou, which is located at the foot of the mountain. Moreover, the cumulative overland inflow in the low-lying region could exceed 1 m in the study region, and the soil moisture increased by 3% on average. Thus, water accumulation in low-lying areas caused by the confluence of overland flow can be more reasonably simulated. The simulated refinement was further improved by providing a higher spatial resolution, and the physical scheme showed good consistency between the different spatial resolutions. The temporal variation in the cumulative surface runoff simulated by the new scheme matches well with the variations in precipitation, where the peak value lags precipitation by 6 h. The large cumulative surface runoff values in the new scheme mainly appear in the low-lying areas of Zhengzhou, with the maximum reaching 2.26 m; conversely, in the original model, the cumulative surface runoff in these low-lying areas does not change with time and the maximum value is only 0.65 m. To enable a comparison with the Noah-MP-OF scheme, the original WRF-hydro model with a spatial resolution of 250 m was also used to simulate this flood process in Zhengzhou. The spatial distribution of the water depth simulated by WRF-hydro is apparently different from those monitored by satellite and simulated by the Noah-MP-OF scheme, with the depth simulated by WRF-hydro being notably less, which is inconsistent with the severe flood disaster that occurred in Zhengzhou. This drawback of WRF-hydro may be related to the fact that it does not properly capture the dynamic process of overland flow at the grid scale. Evidently, the Noah-MP-OF scheme has advantages over WRF-hydro in simulating extreme floods in Zhengzhou. In the future, a river model will be added to parameterize the confluence process of the river network, and the parameterization of the drainage process will be refined to reduce the influence of uncertain factors, such as the urban pipe network and pumping station, on the simulation of water depth.In addition, the Noah-MP-OF land surface model will be applied in the WRF model to consider the feedback of the dynamic wave equation on land-atmosphere interactions and atmospheric circulations and can more accurately reflect the multilevel coupling processes of the atmosphere, land surface, and hydrology.

TI  - Spaceborne GNSS Reflectometry With Galileo Signals on FY-3E/GNOS-II: Measurements, Calibration, and Wind Speed Retrieval
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reflected global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals from Earth surface can be received by receivers at low Earth orbit for the remote sensing of geophysical parameters. While the technique has been studied for around 30 years, most early spaceborne GNSS reflectometry missions only adapted to receive GPS signals and the studies of reflected Galileo (GAL) signals in space are limited. The Navigation Satellite System Occultation Sounder II (GNOS-II) payload onboard the FY-3E satellite is the first mission that can operationally receive reflected GPS, BeiDou (BDS), and GAL signals at the same time. This letter presents the GAL reflectometry measurements from GNOS-II together with their calibration and wind speed (WS) retrieval methods. Results show that while GAL has a different signal modulation, the observables can be used to retrieve WSs using the same geophysical model functions (GMFs) of GPS after a dedicated calibration. The retrieved WSs from GAL also have a comparable accuracy as those from GPS and BDS.

TI  - Analysis and Mitigation of Radio Frequency Interference in Spaceborne GNSS Ocean Reflectometry Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With low signal power, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) reflections in space are vulnerable to radio frequency interference (RFI) across the globe which can contaminate observations of GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) and introduce bias in the retrieved geophysical parameters. This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the RFI in the Fengyun-3E Navigation Satellite System Occultation Sounder II (FY-3E/GNOS-II) GNSS-R data over the ocean. It was found that major sources of interference are the reflections of regional GNSS and Satellite-Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS), and external L-band interference signals from the ground. Furthermore, interference can have different impacts on the observations through increasing the noise power, decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or biasing observables depending on the type of interference and retrieval method. Some geography-dependent biases in the retrieved wind speeds were found to be related to RFI. An RFI mitigation method is then presented to calibrate observables and reduce geographical wind speed bias for the operational retrieval system. The bias and root-mean-square error of retrieved wind speeds from a region that is affected by RFI were reduced from 1.26 and 2.78 to 0.04 and 1.59 m/s, respectively.

TI  - HEALTH RISK APPRAISAL OF URBAN THERMAL ENVIRONMENT AND CHARACTERISTIC ANALYSIS ON VULNERABLE POPULATIONS
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous global warming and frequent extreme high temperatures keep the urban climate health risk increasing, seriously threatening residents' emotional health. Therefore, analysis on spatial distribution of the health risk that the urban heat island (UHI) effect imposes on emotional health as well as basic research on the characteristics of vulnerable populations need to be conducted. This study, with Tianjin city as the case, analyzed data from Landsat remote-sensing images, meteorological stations, and digital maps, explored the influence of summer UHI effect on distress (a typical negative emotion factor) and its spatiotemporal evolution, and conducted difference analysis on the age groups, genders, family state, and distress levels of vulnerable populations. The results show: (1) During the period of 1992-2020, the level and area of UHI influence on residents' distress drastically increased-influence level elevated from level 2-4 to level 4-7, and highlevel influence areas were concentrated in six districts of central Tianjin. (2) Influence of the UHI effect on distress varied in different age groups-generally dropping with fluctuations as residents got older, especially residents aged 50-59. (3) Men experienced a W-shaped pattern in distress and were more irritable and unsteady emotionally; while women were more sensitive to distress in the beginning, but they became more placid as temperature got higher. (4) Studies on family status show that couples living together showed sound heat resistance in the face of heat stress, while middle-aged and elderly people living alone or with children were relatively weak in adjusting to high ambient temperature.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Geo-Congress on Sustainable Infrastructure Solutions from the Ground Up

AB  - Machine learning algorithms can be used to detect landslides and develop landslide inventories following natural disasters. This study aims to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms, specifically supervised methods, in detecting landslides on a complete high-quality landslide inventory. The M(w)6.5 Lefkada earthquake that occurred on November 17, 2015, causing more than 700 landslides, was selected as the case study. The classification model used Worldview satellite imagery and digital elevation models (DEM) as input. Three machine learning algorithms were considered: random forest (RF), support vectors machine (SVM), and maximum likelihood (ML). All three machine learning algorithms classify landslides generally successfully, and RF achieves the best performance. Amalgamation is a typical issue in landslide detection and mapping, where multiple adjacent landslides are classified and mapped as one. This paper used flow direction to separate amalgamated landslides in the detection result. The result shows that the RF classifier captures large landslides more accurately than small landslides. Satellite imagery with higher resolution results in better classification performance than coarse-resolution imagery.

TI  - A New High-Resolution Remote Sensing Monitoring Method for Nutrients in Coastal Waters
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mariculture is an important offshore economic activity, and excessive farming can lead to the deterioration of sea ecology. The concentration of nutrients [mainly dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and orthophosphate-phosphorous (PO4)] is the main factor characterizing the health condition of farmed seas. Conventional field monitoring methods are spatiotemporally limited, and remote sensing technology has the advantages of high spatial coverage and long time series monitoring. Thus, the Sentinel-3 reflectance data and the in situ measured data for the offshore waters of Wenzhou were matched simultaneously. Then, the matched dataset between the Sentinel-2 band and the in situ measured data were obtained through spectral correspondence conversion between Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3, and a machine learning algorithm was used to build the inversion model with an independent validation process. The correlations between the concentration of nutrients, area of rafts, and precipitation were assessed, and a strong positive correlation was found between the concentration of nutrients and the area of rafts, and a weak negative correlation was found between the former and precipitation.

TI  - High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Can Better Estimate Changes in Carbon Assimilation of an Urban Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forests have the potential to sink atmospheric CO2. With the improvement of coverage of vegetation in urban environments, more attention has been paid to the carbon sequestration potential of the urban forest. However, the high fragmentation of urban forests makes it difficult to evaluate their carbon budget on a regional scale. In this study, the GPP-NIRv relationship model was employed to estimate GPP in Suzhou by MODIS, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing data, and to further explore what kind of remote images can figure out the spatial-temporal pattern of GPP in urban forests. We found that the total GPP of the terrestrial ecosystem in Suzhou reached 8.43, 8.48, and 9.30 Tg C yr-1 for MODIS, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2, respectively. Monthly changes of GPP were able to be derived by MODIS and Sentinel-2, with two peaks in April and July. According to Sentinel-2, urban forests accounted for the majority of total GPP, with an average of about 44.63%, which was larger than the results from GPP products with coarser resolutions. Additionally, it is clear from the high-resolution images that the decline of GPP in May was due to human activities such as the rotation of wheat and rice crops and the pruning of urban forests. Our results improve the understanding of the contribution of the urban forest to the carbon budget and highlight the importance of high-resolution remote sensing images for estimating urban carbon assimilation.

TI  - Quick Quality Assessment and Radiometric Calibration of C-SAR/01 Satellite Using Flexible Automatic Corner Reflector
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - C-SAR/01, the successor of China's Gaofen-3 Satellite, which launched on 23 November 2021, is the first synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite to be launched in China's civil space infrastructure plan and has served as an invaluable data resource. Radiometric calibration and validation are prerequisites for the quantitative application of SAR data. In this study, the radiometric calibration experiments of C-SAR/01 data of the ultra-fine strip (UFS) and fine strip I (FSI) modes were conducted applying flexible automatic triangular trihedral corner reflectors deployed in Xilinhot SAR satellite calibration and validation site. Accordingly, the image quality and radiometric calibration accuracy were evaluated. The results show that the spatial resolution, peak sidelobe ratio, and integrated sidelobe ratio of UFS and FSI mode data of C-SAR/01 are better than those of the design indexes, and the calibration results from the integral method are more stable than those from the peak method. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the calibration constant for UFS mode data is 0.234 dB, with the relative and absolute calibration accuracies obtained as 0.233 and 0.532 dB, respectively, whereas the standard deviation calibration constant for FSI mode data is 0.198 dB, with its relative and absolute calibration accuracies evaluated as 0.199 and 0.333 dB, respectively.

TI  - <i>In vitro</i> Function Study of Different Negative Charge Pullulan Nanoparticles for Sentinel Lymph Node Angiography
T2  - CURRENT DRUG DELIVERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Many dyes or radioactive markers used for sentinel lymph node (SLN) have the shortcomings of false positive and radiation injury. Indocyanine green (ICG) seems to have a lower false positive rate and tissue damage, without a clear field of vision during the operation. Methods For the shortcomings, we successfully synthesized three anionic pullulan materials, changed the degree of hydrophobic for size controlling (< 50nm) to prepare CHP nanoparticles (NPs) and changed the succinyl degree to prepare CHPC NPs with different negative surface potential. Results The size of those NPs were less than 50nm under (transmission electron microscope) TEM, with hydrodynamic size of 90.67 & PLUSMN; 2.2 nm of CHP, 105.8 & PLUSMN; 1.7 nm of CHPC1 and 115.9 & PLUSMN; 2.3 nm of CHPC2. Moreover, the Zeta potential of CHP, CHPC1 and CHPC2 were -1.9 & PLUSMN; 0.2 mV, -9.6 & PLUSMN; 0.3 mV and -19.4 & PLUSMN; 0.7 mV. The size of ICG-loading CHP, CHPC1 and CHPC2 NPs increased to 109.4 & PLUSMN; 2.7 nm, 113.8 & PLUSMN; 1.2 nm and 30.6 & PLUSMN; 3.5 nm, as the zeta potential decreased to -2.7 & PLUSMN; 0.4 mV, -12.5 & PLUSMN; 1.6 mV and -23.1 & PLUSMN; 1.2 mV. With the increasing degree of succinyl, the size increased and the zeta potential decreased. At the same time, the higher degree of succinyl drug-loading NPs have lower release and have increased the stability of ICG. We found that the blank-NPs had no significant toxicity to normal cells (HSF), as the ICG@CHP group had larger toxicity than the CHPCs and control. Moreover, the cellular uptake was decreased with the increased degree of succinyl.

TI  - Research on Variation of Water Quality Before and After Ecological Water Supplementation in the Beijing Section of the Yongding River
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid economic and social development in the Yongding River basin has resulted in a considerable increase in water consumption, and the Beijing section of the Yongding River has been continuously cut off since 1997, causing the water ecosystem to be seriously degraded. Since 2019, an ecological water supplementation project for the Yongding River has been implemented to repair its ecosystem. Water quality changes in the Yongding River after ecological water supplementation are an important aspect of the comprehensive evaluation of the effect of the project in the Beijing section of the river. In this study, we use Sentinel2-MSI satellite remote sensing data to determine the water transparency and chlorophyll-a concentration of the Beijing section of the river in the summers of 2018, 2019, and 2020, and to analyze the spatial and temporal changes in water quality after the ecological water supplementation of the river in the spring of 2019. Compared with the values from 2018 before the ecological water supplementation, the transparency increased and the water was more limpid in 2019 and 2020 after the ecological water supplementation; the concentration of chlorophyll-a decreased, and the degree of eutrophication was reduced; variations in these water quality parameters illustrate that ecological water supplementation improved the ecotope of the Beijing section of the Yongding River.

TI  - An Appraisal of Atmospheric Correction and Inversion Algorithms for Mapping High-Resolution Bathymetry Over Coral Reef Waters
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetric inversions constitute a key preliminary step when characterizing coral topography. The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) is poised to provide true values for satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) in the absence of measured data. Nevertheless, the influences of the different available algorithms and atmospheric correction (AC) processes applied to construct SDB over coral reef waters are still poorly understood. In this article, three empirical-based bathymetric algorithms [the linear ratio model (LRM), polynomial ratio model (PRM), and exponential ratio model (ERM)] and three ACs [AC for the operational land imager (OLI) lite (ACOLITE), sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) data analysis system (SeaDAS), and sentinel 2 (atmospheric) correction (Sen2Cor)] are evaluated with Sentinel-2A/B multispectral imagery to achieve fine-spatial-resolution bathymetric information. The bathymetry estimates produced by fusing the Sentinel-2A/B and ICESat-2 datasets using the three models exhibit sufficient accuracies, with low percent errors and mean absolute errors (MAEs) between 0.44 and 0.74 m and root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) between 0.61 and 0.96 m. In all cases, the PRM outperforms the ERM and LRM. The AC method comparisons show that the performance of ACOLITE is better than those of Sen2Cor and SeaDAS. The obtained depth estimates are less sensitive to the impacts of the AC methods in relatively shallow waters than in relatively deep waters, and ACOLITE performs more stably. Overall, the PRM coupled with the ACOLITE method performs best. With depths extracted from ICESat-2, high-spatial-resolution SDB data capable of supporting the long-range goal of coral topography analyses are attainable even without in situ datasets.

TI  - A Multiscale Spatiotemporal Fusion Network Based on an Attention Mechanism
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion is an effective and cost-effective method to obtain both high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution images. However, existing methods do not sufficiently extract the deeper features of the image, resulting in fused images which do not recover good topographic detail and poor fusion quality. In order to obtain higher quality spatiotemporal fusion images, a novel spatiotemporal fusion method based on deep learning is proposed in this paper. The method combines an attention mechanism and a multiscale feature fusion network to design a network that more scientifically explores deeper features of the image for different input image characteristics. Specifically, a multiscale feature fusion module is introduced into the spatiotemporal fusion task and combined with an efficient spatial-channel attention module to improve the capture of spatial and channel information while obtaining more effective information. In addition, we design a new edge loss function and incorporate it into the compound loss function, which helps to generate fused images with richer edge information. In terms of both index performance and image details, our proposed model has excellent results on both datasets compared with the current mainstream spatiotemporal fusion methods.

TI  - Building Detection From Panchromatic and Multispectral Images With Dual-Stream Asymmetric Fusion Networks
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building detection from panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images is an essential task for many practical applications. In this article, a dual-stream asymmetric fusion network is proposed, named DAFNet. DAFNet can achieve effective information fusion at the feature level. It obtains better building detection performance from the following three perspectives: a two-stream network structure is designed to guarantee the ability to extract information from PAN and MS images; an asymmetric feature fusion module is proposed to fuse features efficiently and concisely; and two consistency regularization losses, i.e., PAN information preservation loss and cross-modal semantic consistency loss are applied to further explore the consistency between features for better fusion. The experiments are conducted on a challenging building detection dataset collected from GaoFen-2 satellite images. Comprehensive evaluations on 12 popular detection methods demonstrate the superiority of our DAFNet compared with the existing state-of-the-art fusion methods. We reveal that feature-level fusion is more suitable for building detection from PAN-MS images.

TI  - Global Surface Water Density Masks to Refine Sentinel 3 Data Acquisitions
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is part of the first generation of Copernicus satellites and was set out to deliver operationally high quality measurements over ocean, land, and atmosphere. The European Space Agency (ESA) is now studying concepts for the Next Generation Sentinel-3 Topography (S3NG-T) mission that would launch in the 2032+ time period. In order to meet the primary objectives of the S3NG-T mission requirement document a complex analysis of river and lake targets is required to size the satellite mass memory and downlink system. We have adopted a different approach that derives a non-conservative mask of water density that defines a more useful user friendly approach to specifying where river and lake targets are located. Within this work, the design and construction of our water density maps as well as application examples are discussed. The results prove an easy-to-apply methodology to create global surface water density maps using high-resolution water body maps. The work further illustrates different use cases to optimize data sizing considering constraints such as global coverage, river width, and total data volume.

TI  - Decision Support Tool for Integrated Water Resources Management Based on GIS, Remote Sensing and SWAT Model: A Case Study in the Upper Part of Dong Nai River Basin, Vietnam

CP  - 2nd International Conference on Geo-Spatial Technologies and Earth Resources (GTER)

AB  - Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) has been a promising approach to ensure sustainable water resources management. Therein, the management tool is one of the key components for successful IWRM implementation. This paper introduces the IWRM decision support tool for the upper part of the Dong Nai (UPDN) river basin, which plays a pivotal role for the socio-economic development in the Southeast region of Vietnam, through the application of an integrated technology of GIS, remote sensing, and SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. The paper also describes how to calculate water balance and map water resource vulnerability index (VI) for the UPDN as well as its sub-basins. Landsat satellite images and data related to water resources information (quantity and quality) of the basin were collected. The results show that the UPDN basin's water pollution and water vulnerability were at a moderate level of which VI was 0.318. However, there were relative differences of these between sub-basins. The VIs of the subbasins of Dak Nong, Dak R'Keh, and La Nga rose up 0.4-0.7 as highly vulnerable areas which should be prioritized for sustainable water management actions. These results evidenced that the integrated techniques could be an efficient approach to provide useful information on the status of water resources to stakeholders in terms of sustainable basin development and management via IWRM.

AB  - Landsat satellite data have been effectively used for mineral resources extraction. This paper presents an automatic method for clay minerals extraction from Landsat 8 OLI image based on band rationing and principal component analysis methods. Firstly, the Landsat 8 data is used to calculate the NIR/RED (band5/band4) and SWIR1/SWIR2 (band6/band7) band rationing images. To highlight the distribution of clay minerals, these band rationing images are further used to multiply the digital number values of NIR and SWIR2 bands, then obtaining (band5/4) x band5 and (band6/7) x band7 images. Finally, the principal component analysis (PCA) method is used to calculate the principal components, then select the 2nd principal component (PC2) to detect clay minerals by the automatic thresholding method. The results in this research can be used to provide input information for mineral exploration.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Surface Melt on Antarctica: Opportunities and Challenges
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface melt is an important driver of ice shelf disintegration and its consequent mass loss over the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Monitoring surface melt using satellite remote sensing can enhance our understanding of ice shelf stability. However, the sensors do not measure the actual physical process of surface melt, but rather observe the presence of liquid water. Moreover, the sensor observations are influenced by the sensor characteristics and surface properties. Therefore, large inconsistencies can exist in the derived melt estimates from different sensors. In this study, we apply state-of-the-art melt detection algorithms to four frequently used remote sensing sensors, i.e., two active microwave sensors, which are Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Sentinel-1, a passive microwave sensor, i.e., Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS), and an optical sensor, i.e., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We intercompare the melt detection results over the entire Antarctic Ice Sheet and four selected study regions for the melt seasons 2015-2020. Our results show large spatiotemporal differences in detected melt between the sensors, with particular disagreement in blue ice areas, in aquifer regions, and during wintertime surface melt. We discuss that discrepancies between sensors are mainly due to cloud obstruction and polar darkness, frequency-dependent penetration of satellite signals, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution, as well as the applied melt detection methods. Nevertheless, we argue that different sensors can complement each other, enabling improved detection of surface melt over the Antarctic Ice Sheet.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An urban heat island phenomenon has increased in the last decades due to rapid urbanization, resulting in a significant impact on local climate. In this study, remote sensing data was used to analyze Spatiotemporal patterns of Ur-ban Heat Island Intensity (UHII) over a 20 years period in a semi-arid climate area. The relationship between the Land Surface Temperature (LST), vegetation and Land Cover Types (LCTs) were examined. The relation between the UHII and its driving factors (different LCTs and meteorological conditions) was analyzed. Analysis of 8-day daytime and nighttime LST data acquired from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) shows that Amman has a significant UHII in both daytime and night time. The results show a negative correlation between the LST and vegetation indicators and between the UHII and the wind speed average, indicating a positive correlation between the UHII and temperature. Vegetation has been proven to significantly reduce LST, mainly in the daytime, due to its cooling effect that results from the transpiration process and shadow effect.

TI  - FloU-Net: An Optical Flow Network for Multimodal Self-Supervised Image Registration
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Image registration is an essential task in image processing, where the final objective is to geometrically align two or more images. In remote sensing, this process allows comparing, fusing, or analyzing data, especially when multimodal images are used. In addition, multimodal image registration becomes fairly challenging when the images have a significant difference in scale and resolution, together with local small image deformations. For this purpose, this letter presents a novel optical flow (OF)-based image registration network, named the FloU-Net, which tries to further exploit intersensor synergies by means of deep learning. The proposed method is able to extract spatial information from resolution differences and through a U-Net backbone generate an OF field estimation to accurately register small local deformations of multimodal images in a self-supervised fashion. For instance, the registration between Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-3 (S3) optical data is not trivial, as there are considerable spectral-spatial differences among their sensors. In this case, the higher spatial resolution of S2 results in S2 data being a convenient reference to spatially improve S3 products, as well as those of the forthcoming Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) mission, since image registration is the initial requirement to obtain higher data processing level products. To validate our method, we compare the proposed FloU-Net with other state-of-the-art techniques using 21 coupled S2/S3 optical images from different locations of interest across Europe. The comparison is performed through different performance measures. Results show that the proposed FloU-Net can outperform the compared methods. The code and dataset are available in https://github.com/ibanezfd/FloU-Net.

TI  - Geospatial assessment of effect of urbanization on natural drainage in a medium-sized town of Akure, Nigeria
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the state of some urban streams in a tropical environment of Nigeria. It analysed satellite images which include Landsat 5 TM (1986), Landsat 7 ETM (2002), Landsat 8 (2018) imageries with 30 m resolution using ENVI 5.3. The images were classified using a supervised classification algorithm to obtain land use/land cover themes for spatial analysis in the ArcMap 10.3 environment while drainage systems were extracted from the topographical map of 1966 of the study area. Result showed a total drainage network of about 90, covering a total distance of 307 km in 1986, which decreased to 226.87 km in 2018. Within the study period (32 years), more streams experienced decrease in lengths (231.44 km) than those whose lengths increased (129.85 km). While 136.92 km stream lengths were lost within the study period, about 25.45 km stream length were rejuvenated. Urban landuse correspondingly increased from 18.8% in 1986 to 52.2% in 2018, suggesting that a converse relationship between increase in urban land cover and dearth of streams in the area. The study provides information regarding the current status of the drainage system for effective planning and management of flood hazards in the study area. It also canvasses for adequate provision and maintenance of setbacks to streams and rivers under the supervision of the Development Control Department (DCD) of the Ondo State Ministry of Urban Development and Regional Planning (OSMUD & RP).

TI  - Improving Land Use/Cover Classification Accuracy from Random Forest Feature Importance Selection Based on Synergistic Use of Sentinel Data and Digital Elevation Model in Agriculturally Dominated Landscape
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) mapping can be of great help in changing land use decisions, but accurate mapping of LULC categories is challenging, especially in semi-arid areas with extensive farming systems and seasonal vegetation phenology. Machine learning algorithms are now widely used for LULC mapping because they provide analytical capabilities for LULC classification. However, the use of machine learning algorithms to improve classification performance is still being explored. The objective of this study is to investigate how to improve the performance of LULC models to reduce prediction errors. To address this question, the study applied a Random Forest (RF) based feature selection approach using Sentinel-1, -2, and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) data. Results from RF show that the Sentinel-2 data only achieved an out-of-bag overall accuracy of 84.2%, while the Sentinel-1 and SRTM data achieved 83% and 76.44%, respectively. Classification accuracy improved to 89.1% when Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 backscatter, and SRTM data were combined. This represents a 4.9% improvement in overall accuracy compared to Sentinel-2 alone and a 6.1% and 12.66% improvement compared to Sentinel-1 and SRTM data, respectively. Further independent validation, based on equally sized stratified random samples, consistently found a 5.3% difference between the Sentinel-2 and the combined datasets. This study demonstrates the importance of the synergy between optical, radar, and elevation data in improving the accuracy of LULC maps. In principle, the LULC maps produced in this study could help decision-makers in a wide range of spatial planning applications.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of the image of Humay, that is one of the key characters in the oral folk art of the Bashkirs. In the mythology of the Bashkirs, Humay acts as a mythical swan bird, the mistress of the bird kingdom, possessing the gift of reincarnation. Humay-swan is a divine bird. She is not only the daughter of the Sun and the solar deity Samrau, but she herself is the incarnation of the Sun. As the wife of the the hero ancestor and the god-demiurge Ural-batyr, Humay gives him the heavenly horse Akbuzat and the magic damask sword. She participates in the creation of nature and fauna of the Southern Urals and fights demonic forces. In mythology, Humay is recognized as the foremother of the Bashkirs. In the oral literature of the Bashkirs, remnants of reasoning about the Humay bird as a benefactor of people are found. As a mother-goddess, Humay patronizes the creation and preservation of family relationships, the fertility of women, and is the intercessor of women in childbirth. In the folk art of the Bashkirs, she acts as the patroness of heroes, the giver of happiness and wealth, and can also regenerate a person in a new quality. The image of the female deity Humay / Umay is found in the mythology of a wide range of peoples of the world.

AB  - The article is devoted to the study of records of dialect speech, verbalizing the ideas of ru-ral residents of the Vologda region about the system of transport and means of commu-nication. The object of analysis is the lexical set of names of vehicles and means of com-munication, as well as the corpus of texts. Informants differentiate roads in detail from the point of view of the possibilities of their use in summer or winter, for walking, skiing, wheeled, sledge, caterpillar, sled, etc. trans-portation. Many traditional beliefs and cus-toms of dialect speakers are associated with the road. Informants living near navigable rivers and large lakes perceive movement by water as one of the ordinary components of the transport system, while those living far from water bodies treat water transport with caution and prejudice, emphasizing the dan-ger of the water element. The most vivid impressions of dialect speakers about move-ment in space are associated with air trans-port. The narrative of this event is clothed in the genre form of a "story-plate", which occu-pies an intermediate position between eve ry-day and folklore non-fairy-tale prose. How-ever, such stories, as a rule, tell about the fi rst or only air fl ight in the life of the informant.

TI  - Structural and mineral mapping using multispectral images in the Central High Atlas of Morocco
T2  - ESTUDIOS GEOLOGICOS-MADRID
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central High Atlas is one of the geological structures that belong to the Moroccan Atlas massif. It presents a great geological diversity and many structural and facies features. It is controlled by main faults of N70 to E-W direction that are visible at different scales and is rich in numerous mineralized veins. This area was the subject of the present work, in which we simulated the images of Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel 2, and Aster sensors to map the hydrothermal alteration minerals associated with a lithostructural mapping that can provide more information on the mineralization of this study area. We highlight different approaches to remote sensing, considering first the methods of extraction of lineaments from the infrared-band of the Landsat 8 OLI image and from the GDEM ASTER to highlight the geological features of the study area. To obtain a good discrimination of the lithological units, Principal Component Analysis and Optimal Index Factor were applied to create colored composites with a better visual interpretation in order to generate a good lithological mapping, and finally, many band ratios are proposed for ASTER, Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2 to derive several maps corresponding to the hydrothermal alteration zones that are compared to the geological map of the studied site, presenting a favorable correlation between them. The analysis of the results of the obtained maps allowed us to identify the main structural directions encompassing the NE-SW to E-W, NNE-SWSW and ENE-WSW families and also allowed us to highlight two potential zones of mineralization; one located to the south of Demnate at the western end of the Central High Atlas and the other in the middle part of the Central High Atlas. The superposition of the alteration maps and the fracturing map shows that the zones that are favorable for mineralization deposits are affected by faults in a generally NE-SW direction.

TI  - On the Identification of Agroforestry Application Areas Using Object-Oriented Programming
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of possible areas for the application of agroforestry is essential and involves the usage of various technics. The recognition of forest types using satellite or aerial imagery is the first step toward this goal. This is a tedious task involving the application of remote sensing techniques and a variety of computer software. The overall performance of this approach is very good and the resulting land use maps can be considered of high accuracy. However, there is also the need for performing high-speed characterization using techniques that can determine forest types automatically and produce quick and acceptable results without the need for specific software. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology that uses Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instrument (MODIS) aboard the TERRA satellite. The software developed automatically downloads data using Google Earth Engine and processes them using Google Colab, which are both free-access platforms. The results from the analysis were exported to ArcGIS for evaluation and comparison against the CORINE land cover inventory using the latest update (2018).

AB  - As the Turks outside the Ottoman Empire lost their independence from 1885 and the ideas such as Ottomanism and Pan-Islamism were overwhelmed with the zeitgeist, the idea of unity emerged as a worldview and a new image of civilization in the Turkic World, which reinterpreted its civilizational identity within the frame-work of a multilevel reconstruction period. This study addresses the reconstruction of the centuries-long historical and cultural heritage of the Turkic world by the representatives of this idea based on the unity of language, i.e. having language as a unifying element, from a historical perspective. In this framework, studies published in five different languages were analyzed.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - World's largest glaciers lie in Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) outside polar region, are the source of fresh water which accommodates the needs of millions of people living downstream. Impact of changing climate on cryosphere can be measured critically from glacier movement due to global warming. Due to complex terrain and unpredictable weather, it is not feasible to measure glaciers' velocity and movement through field surveys physically. For this purpose, the current study aimed to assess the variation of glaciers velocity using advance geospatial technique like the co-registration and correlation (COSI-CORR) of optically sensed satellite images. Time-series analysis on the Landsat-8 data (2013-2020) revealed successfully for computing the surface ice velocity of glaciers of Hunza Basin. Results show that the velocity of a glacier increases with the altitude whereas speed decreases at the terminus. Moreover, it has been noted from spatial patterns of glacier surface ice velocity that the tributary glaciers contribute to the mainstream glacier velocity significantly, which increases at the terminus. Subsequently, the varying ice velocity was determined by orientation, debris cover, glacier size, and altitude for glaciers. The study recommended to regularly monitor the dynamics of glaciers in this region to cater the impacts of global warming and climate change.

AB  - This paper aims to detect rice field damage from natural disasters in Bangladesh using high-resolution satellite imagery. The authors developed ground truth data for rice field damage from the field level. At first, NDVI differences before and after the disaster are calculated to identify possible crop loss. The areas equal to and above the 0.33 threshold are marked as crop loss areas as significant changes are observed. The authors also verified crop loss areas by collecting data from local farmers. Later, different bands of satellite data (Red, Green, Blue) and (False Color Infrared) are useful to detect crop loss area. We used the NDVI different images as ground truth to train the DeepLabV3plus model. With RGB, we got IoU 0.41 and with FCI, we got IoU 0.51. As FCI uses NIR, Red, Blue bands and NDVI is normalized difference between NIR and Red bands, so greater FCI's IoU score than RGB is expected. But RGB does not perform very badly here. So, where other bands are not available, RGB can use to understand crop loss areas to some extent. The ground truth developed in this paper can be used for segmentation models with very high resolution RGB only images such as Bing, Google etc.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.
AB  - Background: We explored whether hospital-based surveillance is useful in detecting severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) clusters and how often these events result in outbreak investigation and community mitigation.Methods: During May 2009-December 2020, physicians at 14 sentinel hospitals prospectively identified SARI clusters (i.e., ≥2 SARI cases who developed symptoms ≤10days of each other and lived <30min walk or <3km from each other). Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). We describe the demographic of persons within clusters, laboratory results, and outbreak investigations.Results: Field staff identified 464 clusters comprising 1427 SARI cases (range 0-13 clusters per month). Sixty percent of clusters had three, 23% had two, and 17% had ≥4 cases. Their median age was 2years (inter-quartile range [IQR] 0.4-25) and 63% were male. Laboratory results were available for the 464 clusters with a median of 9days (IQR=6-13days) after cluster identification. Less than one in five clusters had cases that tested positive for the same virus: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 58 (13%), influenza viruses in 24 (5%), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in five (1%), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) in three (0.6%), adenovirus in two (0.4%). While 102/464 (22%) had poultry exposure, none tested positive for influenza A (H5N1) or A (H7N9). None of the 464 clusters led to field deployments for outbreak response.Conclusions: For 11years, none of the hundreds of identified clusters led to an emergency response. The value of this event-based surveillance might be improved by seeking larger clusters, with stronger epidemiologic ties or decedents.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Despite focusing on cholera burden, epidemiologic studies in Bangladesh tend to be limited in geographic scope. National-level cholera surveillance data can help inform cholera control strategies and assess the effectiveness of preventive measures. Hospital-based sentinel surveillance among patients with suspected diarrhea in different sites across Bangladesh has been conducted since 2014. We selected an age-stratified sample of 20 suspected cholera cases each week from each sentinel site, tested stool for the presence of Vibrio cholerae O1/O139 by culture, and characterized antibiotic susceptibility in a subset of culture-positive isolates. We estimated the odds of being culture positive among suspected cholera cases according to different potential risk factors. From May 4, 2014 through November 30, 2021, we enrolled 51,414 suspected cases from our sentinel surveillance sites. We confirmed V. cholerae O1 in 5.2% of suspected cases through microbiological culture. The highest proportion of confirmed cholera cases was from Chittagong (9.7%) and the lowest was from Rangpur Division (0.9%). Age, number of purges, duration of diarrhea, occupation, and season were the most relevant factors in distinguishing cholera-positive suspected cases from cholera-negative suspected cases. Nationwide surveillance data show that cholera is circulating in Bangladesh and the southern region is more affected than the northern region. Antimicrobial resistance patterns indicate that multidrug resistance (resistance to three or more classes of antibiotics) of V. cholerae O1 could be a major threat in the future. Alignment of these results with Bangladesh's cholera-control program will be the foundation for future research into the efficacy of cholera-control initiatives.

T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing agricultural production is a major concern that aims to increase income, reduce hunger, and improve other measures of well-being. Recently, the prediction of soil-suitability has become a primary topic of rising concern among academics, policymakers, and socio-economic analysts to assess dynamics of the agricultural production. This work aims to use physico-chemical and remotely sensed phenological parameters to produce soil-suitability maps (SSM) based on Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms in a semi-arid and arid region. Towards this goal an inventory of 238 suitability points has been carried out in addition to14 physico-chemical and 4 phenological parameters that have been used as inputs of machine-learning approaches which are five MLA prediction, namely RF, XgbTree, ANN, KNN and SVM. The results showed that phenological parameters were found to be the most influential in soil-suitability prediction. The validation of the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve approach indicates an area under the curve and an AUC of more than 0.82 for all models. The best results were obtained using the XgbTree with an AUC = 0.97 in comparison to other MLA. Our findings demonstrate an excellent ability for ML models to predict the soil-suitability using physico-chemical and phenological parameters. The approach developed to map the soil-suitability is a valuable tool for sustainable agricultural development, and it can play an effective role in ensuring food security and conducting a land agriculture assessment.

TI  - The scientistic worldview and its relationships with fear of COVID, conspiracy beliefs, preventive behaviors, and attitudes towards vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Polish sample
T2  - CURRENT ISSUES IN PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND The scientistic worldview is characterized by the tendency to justify beliefs and behavior with scientific findings and to function on the basis of theorems and opinions for-mulated by scientists. The aim of this study was to test whether the attitudes typical for the scientistic worldview could be related to beliefs and behaviors that may reduce the risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19.PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE The study was conducted on a Polish sample of 1286 partic-ipants, using an online survey platform. Participants were asked to complete questionnaires to measure attitudes towards vaccines on COVID-19, the scientistic worldview, fear of COVID, conspiracy beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic, and preventive behaviors undertaken. Partici-pants were also asked about their personal experiences with the pandemic.RESULTS The study showed that the scientistic worldview was associ-ated with a higher fear of COVID, a higher level of contain-ment-related behavior, a lower level of conspiracy beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic, and more positive attitudes towards vaccination against COVID-19. A structural model of relations between the studied variables turned out to be very effective and explained 51% of the variance of contain-ment-related behavior and 63% of the variance of attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines.CONCLUSIONS The study found that preventive behaviors and attitudes to-wards vaccination against COVID-19 were weakly related to personal experiences during the pandemic but signifi-cantly correlated with psychological variables. The results suggest that very positive, scientistic attitudes towards sci-ence may be related to higher adherence to science-based public health recommendations.

AB  - Landslides are disturbances in the landscapes causing changes in slope profile in a positive or negative trend induced by natural or anthropogenic activity. Landslides in populated regions could be disastrous and lead to enormous casualties and substantial economic loss. This paper aims to map slow-moving ground displacements with millimetre precision using non-invasive, high resolution, wide area coverage, and cost effective earth observation data. This study uses the phase differences in multi-temporal SAR images with Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) for our analysis. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PS-InSAR), which utilizes a long time series of radar images was considered to detect the potential coherent measurement points (deformations) in the region. This research work also investigates the efficacy of the StaMPS/MTI toolkit for measuring the surface deformation over the Puthumala region using time series SAR data (29 SLC images) for the period 2019 to 2022.

TI  - Co-Creatively Producing Knowledge With Other-Than-Human Organisms in a (Bio)Technology-Controlled Artistic Environment
T2  - SOCIAL INCLUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Along with the increasing awareness about the destructive force of humankind on nature, existential questions about how to create a more sustainable relationship with the natural world have emerged. To acquire a more eco-friendly attitude, we need to go beyond the well-established knowledge cultures that highlight a nature versus culture dichotomy. This study focuses on bio art as an epistemic vehicle to re-imagine our understanding of and connection to the natural world. Drawing on the theoretical stance of philosophical posthumanism, we discuss how artistic co-creation processes involving humans and other-than-humans hold the potential to introduce a shift in our worldview from anthropocentric to ecocentric. We further question what this shift might imply for how we approach the complex relationship between humans and other-than-humans in our own research. We conducted a within-case and cross-case analysis of five bio art projects that previously won the Bio Art & Design Award (2018-2020). To analyze the data, we used a combined approach of visual and context analysis and material semiotics. Qualitative interviews were used as a data collection technique to investigate the lived experiences of both artists and scientists involved in the projects. Our findings suggest that bio art's epistemic significance can primarily be found in its multispecies perspective: By following the wills and ways of bio-organisms, bio art makes the invisible connection between nature and culture visible. Bio art can provoke our thinking about how to include and approach other-than-human agency in the context of socially engaged research practices.

TI  - Convolution neural network based infection transmission analysis on Covid-19 using GIS and Covid data materials.
T2  - Materials today. Proceedings
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Towards the improvement of predicting and analyzing the infection transmission, a novel CNN (Convolution Neural Network) based Covid Infection Transmission Analysis (CNN-CITA) is presented in this article. The method works based on both GIS data set and the Covid data set. The method reads all the data from the data sets. From the remote sensing data, the method extracts different climate conditions like temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Similarly from Global Information System data set, the locations of the peoples are fetched and merged. The merged data has been split into number of time frame, at each condition, the data sets are merged. Such merged data has been trained with deep learning networks which support the search of person location and mobility. Based on the result and the data set maintained by the governments, the infection transmission rate has been measured on region basis. In each region of movement performed by any person, the method computes the infection Transmission Rate (ITR) in two time window as before and after. According to the infection rate and ITR value of different region, a subset of sources are selected as vulnerable sources. The method produces higher performance in predicting the vulnerable sources and supports the reduction of infection rate.

TI  - Satellite-Observed Spatial and Temporal Sea Surface Temperature Trends of the Baltic Sea between 1982 and 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Baltic Sea is one of the fastest-warming marginal seas globally, and its temperature rise has adversely affected its physical and biochemical characteristics. In this study, forty years (1982-2021) of sea surface temperature (SST) data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) were used to investigate spatial and temporal SST variability of the Baltic Sea. To this end, annual maximum and minimum SST stacked series, i.e., time series of stacked layers of satellite data, were generated using high-quality observations acquired at night and were fed to an automatic algorithm to detect linear and non-linear trend patterns. The linear trend pattern was the dominant trend type in both stacked series, while more pixels with non-linear trend patterns were detected when using the annual minimum SST. However, both stacked series showed increases in SST across the Baltic Sea. Annual maximum SST increased by an average of 0.062 +/- 0.041 degrees C per year between 1982 and 2021, while annual minimum SST increased by an average of 0.035 +/- 0.017 degrees C per year over the same period. Averaging annual maximum and minimum trends produces a spatial average of 0.048 +/- 0.022 degrees C rise in SST per year over the last four decades.

TI  - Detection and Prevention of Medication Errors by the Network of Sentinel Pharmacies in a Southern European Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - A medication error (ME) is a drug-related problem that has been recognized as a common and serious threat to patient safety. The aim of this study was to detect and analyze ME reports occurring throughout the therapeutic process through the community's pharmacies in order to improve the efficacy and safety of medications and contribute to the prevention of future MEs. This was a three-year descriptive, observational, and prospective study to detect and analyze the different MEs reported by the Catalan sentinel pharmacies network (Catalan SePhaNet). In total, 1394 notifications of MEs were reported (an incidence rate of 737.34 cases/100,000 inhabitants). MEs were detected more frequently in primary care centers. Most of the MEs reported were caused by an incorrect, incomplete, illegible, or verbal medical prescription (41.3%). Of the global notifications detected, 71.9% did not reach the patient (categories A and B). The drugs most frequently implicated in the reported ME cases were beta-lactam antibiotics. In 6.0% of the cases, the ME caused injury to the patient (categories E and F). In 72.0% of the global notifications, a pharmacist's intervention avoided the ME. The importance of a community pharmacy and the role of a pharmacist were demonstrated in aspects related to patient and drug safety.

AB  - Image registration is one of the essential preprocessing steps in remote sensing data applications. Since Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical images give complementary information, they are used simultaneously for several applications. However, they differ in their geometric and radiometric properties; hence, SAR to optical image registration is challenging. An image registration approach based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to synthesize optical-like SAR images and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based correlation is proposed in this work. cGAN does the image translation of the SAR patch and generates a corresponding optical-like patch. The optical-like SAR image is used as a reference to register the optical image. Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical patch pairs are used for this work. When registered with optical-like patches using FFT-based correlation, optical patches could give a sub-pixel accuracy.

AB  - Wheat species play important role in the price of products and wheat production estimation. There are several mathematical models used for the estimation of the wheat crop but these models are implemented without considering the wheat species which is an important independent variable. The task of wheat species identification is challenging both for human experts as well as for computer vision-based solutions. With the use of satellite remote sensing, it is possible to identify and monitor wheat species on a large scale at any stage of the crop life cycle. In this work, nine popular wheat species are identified by using Landsat8 operational land imager (OLI) and thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) data. Two thousand samples of each wheat crop species are acquired every fifteen days with a temporal resolution of ten multispectral bands (band two to band eleven). This study employs random forest (RF), artificial neural network, support vector machine, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression for nine types of wheat classification. In addition, deep neural networks are also developed. Experimental results indicate that RF shows the best performance of 91% accuracy while DNN obtains a 90.2% accuracy. Results suggest that remotely sensed data can be used in wheat type estimation and to improve the performance of the mathematical models.

TI  - Development of normalized soil area index for urban studies using remote sensing data
T2  - GEOFIZIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents two novel spectral soil area indices to identify bare soil area and distinguish it more accurately from the urban impervious surface area (ISA). This study designs these indices based on medium spatial resolution re-mote sensing data from Landsat 8 OLI dataset. Extracting bare soil or urban ISA is more challenging than extracting water bodies or vegetation in multi -spectral Remote Sensing (RS). Bare soil and the urban ISA area often were mixed because of their spectral similarity in multispectral sensors. This study proposes Normalized Soil Area Index 1 (NSAI1) and Normalized Soil Area Index 2 (NSAI2) using typical multispectral bands. Experiments show that these two indices have an overall accuracy of around 90%. The spectral similarity index (SDI) shows these two indices have higher separability between soil area and ISA than previous indices. The result shows that percentile thresholds can ef-fectively classify bare soil areas from the background. The combined use of both indices measured the soil area of the study area over 71 km2. Most importantly, proposed soil indices can refine urban ISA measurement accuracy in spatiotem- poral studies.

TI  - Tracking diurnal to seasonal variations of gross primary productivity using a geostationary satellite, GK-2A advanced meteorological imager
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The diurnal sampling capability of geostationary satellites provides unprecedented opportunities for monitoring canopy photosynthesis at multiple temporal scales. At the diurnal scale, only geostationary satellites can currently provide sub-daily data at regular intervals, also it can help to minimize data gaps due to clouds at the seasonal scale. However, the potential of geostationary satellites for monitoring photosynthesis has not been explored in depth. In this study, we tracked diurnal to seasonal variations in gross primary production (GPP) using the product of near-infrared reflectance of vegetation and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (NIRvP) over deciduous forests, mixed forests and a rice paddy during the growing season. For this purpose, we generated three levels of reflectance and PAR from Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2A (GK-2A). We examined how NIRvP derived from GK-2A tracked in-situ GPP data collected from five flux tower sites in South Korea. Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) normalized NIRvP agreed well with in-situ GPP over the course of the growing season at hourly (R-2 = 0.68-0.77) and daily timesteps (R-2 = 0.71-0.83). Atmospheric correction and BRDF normalization improved the performance of NIRvP in tracking GPP at both the diurnal and seasonal time scales. Also, GK-2A showed a much higher percentage of available high-quality BRDF data over the whole growing season for all study sites than the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (GK-2A: 85%; MODIS: 39%), especially during the cloudy monsoon period. Our findings demonstrated that the unique observation characteristics of geostationary satellites can contribute to large-scale monitoring of diurnal to seasonal GPP dynamics.

TI  - Prediction of Winter Wheat Harvest Based on Back Propagation Neural Network Algorithm and Multiple Remote Sensing Indices
T2  - PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting the harvest time of wheat in large areas is important for guiding the scheduling of wheat combine harvesters and reducing losses during harvest. In this study, Zhumadian, Zhengzhou and Anyang, the main winter-wheat-producing areas in Henan province, were selected as the observation points, and the main producing areas were from south to north. Based on Landsat 8 satellite remote sensing images, the changes in NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), and NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) were analyzed at different growth stages of winter wheat in 2020. Multiple regression analysis and Back Propagation (BP) neural network machine learning methods were used to establish prediction models for the harvest time of winter wheat at different growth stages. The results showed that the prediction model based on a BP neural network had high accuracy. The RMSE, MAE and MAPE of the training set and the test set were 0.531 and 0.5947, 0.3001 and 0.3104, 0.0114% and 0.0119%, respectively. The prediction model of winter wheat harvest date based on BP neural network was verified in the main winter wheat producing areas of Henan province in 2020 and 2021. The average errors were 1.67 days and 2.13 days, which were less than 3 days, meeting the needs for winter wheat production and harvest. The grain water content of winter wheat at harvest time calculated by the prediction model reached the grain water standard of the wheat combine harvester. Therefore, the prediction of the winter wheat harvest time can be realized based on multiple remote sensing indicators.

TI  - Changes in Water Use Efficiency Caused by Climate Change, CO<sub>2</sub> Fertilization, and Land Use Changes on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator for coupling plant photosynthesis and transpiration, and is also a key factor linking the carbon and water cycles between the land and atmosphere. However, under the combination of climate change and human intervention, the change in WUE is still unclear, especially on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Therefore, satellite remote sensing data and process-based terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) are used in this study to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of WUE over the TP from 2001 to 2010. Then, the effects of land use and land cover change (LULCC) and CO2 fertilization on WUE from 1981-2010 are assessed using TBMs. Results show that climate change is the leading contributor to the change in WUE on the TP, and temperature is the most important factor. LULCC makes a negative contribution to WUE (-20.63%), which is greater than the positive contribution of CO2 fertilization (11.65%). In addition, CO2 fertilization can effectively improve ecosystem resilience on the TP. On the northwest plateau, the effects of LULCC and CO2 fertilization on WUE are more pronounced during the driest years than the annual average. These findings can help researchers understand the response of WUE to climate change and human activity and the coupling of the carbon and water cycles over the TP.

TI  - Collaborative Contrastive Learning for Hyperspectral and LiDAR Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using single-source remote sensing (RS) data for classification of ground objects has certain limitations; however, multimodal RS data contain different types of features, such as spectral features and spatial features of hyperspectral image (HSI) and elevation information of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, which can be used to extract and fuse high-quality features to improve the classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the existing fusion techniques are mostly limited by the number of labeled samples due to the difficulty of label collection in the multimodal RS data. In this article, a fusion method of collaborative contrastive learning (CCL) is proposed to tackle the abovementioned issues for HSI and LiDAR data classification. The proposed CCL approach includes two stages of pretraining (CCL-PT) and fine-tuning (CCL-FT). In the CCL-PT stage, a collaborative strategy is introduced into contrastive learning (CL), which can extract features from HSI and LiDAR data separately and achieve the coordinated feature representation and matching between the two-modal RS data without labeled samples. In the CCL-FT stage, a multilevel fusion network is designed to optimize and fuse the unsupervised collaborative features, which are extracted in the CCL-PT stage for the classification tasks. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that the developed CCL approach can perform excellently on the small sample classification tasks, and CL is feasible for the fusion of multimodal RS data.

TI  - AE-TransUNet plus : An Enhanced Hybrid Transformer Network for Detection of Lunar South Small Craters in LRO NAC Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Impact craters are the most significant topographic features on the lunar surface. They are also essential factors affecting the construction of lunar bases and activities on the lunar surface in the future. Nevertheless, it is difficult to extract the impact craters by image processing methods due to the influence of illumination in the lunar polar region. Furthermore, the digital elevation model (DEM) is unable to extract small impact craters. Therefore, we propose an extraction framework for small craters, namely AE-TransUNet+, for the future lunar South Pole region of interest. The algorithm is applied to grayscale images (0.5 m/pixel) captured by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbital (LRO) narrow-angle camera (NAC). To improve the channel extract and spatial relationship between features, the convolutional block attention modules (CBAMs) and depthwise-separable convolution (DSC) are added to the core TransUNet model, and the redesigned jump connection enhancement module focuses more on small impact crater features. Experiments on the NAC dataset show that AE-TransUNet+ has a higher F1-Score (0.743) and IOU (0.847) compared to other crater detection models. Besides, based on transfer learning, the visualization results of Mars and Mercury show that the proposed method is more efficient in the processing of remote sensing data for different deep space explorations providing better mobility.

TI  - Classification of Conservation Tillage Using Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the remote sensing monitoring of conservation tillage, the acquisition of remote sensing data with high spatial and temporal resolution is critical. The current optical remote sensing images cannot realize both temporal and spatial resolution, especially under cloud and rain interference. Thus, this study employs the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) to obtain the normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) with both temporal and spatial resolution estimated by Sentinel-2 and MODIS using the Index-then-Blend (IB) and Blend-then-Index (BI) fusion schemes. After comparison, the IB scheme was better than the BI scheme in predicting results and prediction efficiency. The NDTI predicted by ESTARFM and Sentinel-2 on June 12, 2020 was compared. A coefficient of determination R-2 of 0.73 and RMSE of 0.000117 was obtained, indicating a high prediction accuracy, which meets the prediction requirements. Based on the predicted ESTARFM NDTI of the study area on May 17, 2021, the maize residue cover (MRC) of the study area was estimated using the previously constructed MRC unary linear regression model. The MRC of the sampling points of the remote sensing images was estimated by verifying the predicted ESTARFM NDTI with the MRC of the sampling points taken in the field extracted by the maximum likelihood classifier, which has a coefficient of determination R-2 of 0.78 and RMSE of 0.00676, signifying better prediction results. The proposed method provides considerable data sources for the remote sensing monitoring studies of conservation tillage.

TI  - Intercalibration of FY-4A AGRI Thermal Infrared Channels Against AHI Channels Using the Double Difference Method
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter addresses the intercalibration of the thermal infrared (TIR) channels 11 (8.0-9.0 mu m), 12 (10.3-11.3 mu m), 13 (11.5-12.5 mu m), and 14 (13.2-13.8 mu m) of the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) on Chinese Fengyun 4A (FY-4A) satellite against the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on the Himawari 8 using the double difference (DD) method with the data in January and July of 2020. To transfer the radiometric calibration from AHI to FY-4A AGRI, an accurate TIR radiative transfer model and intercalibration equations are constructed. The results show that AGRI channel 12 is well calibrated and keeps stable in the two months. However, in other AGRI TIR channels, radiometric calibration biases are obviously observed, especially AGRI channel 11, in which the calibration biases vary by hemisphere and month. The observations in AGRI channels 13 and 14 are about 0.83 and 0.50 K underestimated, respectively. In AGRI channel 11, the observations are averagely 2.36 and 4.08 K overestimated in Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere, respectively. Moreover, in Southern Hemisphere, the observations in AGRI channel 11 in July are averagely 0.55 K warmer than those in January. The intercalibration coefficients were obtained by linear regression, and finally, the radiometric calibration biases in the AGRI TIR channels were successfully removed.

TI  - Angular Effect Correction for Improved LAI and FVC Retrieval Using GF-1 Wide Field View Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) are two essential vegetation parameters for ecological and climate studies. The Chinese Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide field view (WFV) satellite data are a valuable data source for LAI and FVC retrieval at high spatiotemporal resolution. Like its name, GF-1 WFV has very large view angle ranging from 0 degrees to 48 degrees, which can impact the accuracy of vegetation parameter retrieval. The primary aim of the study was to develop an angular effect correction (anisotropy flat index, AFX-fix) method that can effectively normalize GF-1 WFV data. Our objective was to enhance the applicability of the corrected data in retrieving LAI and FVC. The AFX-fix method used angular index, AFX, and a fixed set of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters. LAI and FVC were retrieved from the GF-1 WFV reflectance data using the PROSPECT+SAIL (PROSAIL) model combined with a random forest method. Results showed that the accuracy of LAI and FVC retrieval in wheat and corn from angular corrected GF-1 WFV data was improved with a decrease in root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 0.66 for LAI and 0.03 for FVC compared to that based on the original data. We anticipate that this new method will help improve the performance of LAI retrieval of these crop types using WFV data.

TI  - Random, Environmental, and Representativeness Errors in Ocean Remote Sensing Versus In Situ Data: An Example of Wave Heights From Altimeters
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the errors and uncertainties is important for the applications of oceanic remote sensing data products. In this study, an error modeling method is presented to decompose the error of ocean remote sensing data into three parts: random errors, environmental errors, and representativeness errors. Random errors refer to the zero-mean error uncorrelated to any external variable. Environmental errors are errors systematically dependent on some external or environmental variables. Representativeness errors are errors coming from the difference with the defined truth with respect to measured spatial-temporal ranges. These error components can be estimated with the collocations of only two systems if continuous observations are available from both systems. The methods of estimating and suppressing the magnitudes of these error components are also presented and are demonstrated using altimeter significant wave heights (SWHs) from the CCI-sea state dataset including 11 altimeter missions. For most altimeters, the three error components are within the same order of magnitude. After suppressing these error terms using the presented methods, the root-mean-square errors between altimeter and in situ measurements of SWHs can be decreased for 25%-45% for these altimeters. The understanding of the contributions of different error components in remote sensing data products can guide the direction to improve data accuracy since different error components need to be suppressed in different ways, and it also provides the reference for applications such as data assimilation of models.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been widely used in atmospheric environment and climate change research. Based on data of the Aerosol Robotic Network and Sun-Sky Radiometer Observation Network in the Yangtze River Delta, the retrieval accuracies of MODIS C6.1 Dark Target (DT), Deep Blue (DB), and C6.0 Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) products under different land cover types, aerosol types, and observation geometries were analyzed. About 65.64% of MAIAC AOD is within the expected error (Within EE), which is significantly higher than 41.43% for DT and 56.98% for DB. The DT product accuracy varies most obviously with the seasons, and the Within EE in winter is more than three times that in spring. The DB and MAIAC products have low accuracy in summer but high in other seasons. The accuracy of the DT product gradually decreases with the increase in urban and water land-cover proportion. After being corrected by bias and mean relative error, the DT accuracy is significantly improved, and the Within EE increases by 24.12% and 32.33%, respectively. The observation geometries and aerosol types were also examined to investigate their effects on AOD retrieval.

TI  - Automatic High-Accuracy Sea Ice Monitoring in the Arctic Using MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-accuracy sea ice monitoring is of great significance in responding to global climate change and guiding safe navigation. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors carried by Aqua and Terra satellites have great potential in high-resolution monitoring of sea ice in polar regions. This study developed an automatic high-accuracy sea ice concentration (SIC) detection algorithm for the MODIS data. We used a machine learning algorithm that combines spectral and texture features to obtain high-precision sea ice recognition results. Then, according to the cloud characteristics in MODIS images and the full coverage of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SICs, outlier removal and cloud area filling are carried out. Finally, the SIC result was calculated according to the distribution of ice types. We assessed the accuracy of our high-accuracy SIC product by comparing with the MOD29/MYD29 products and validating with the Landsat 8/9 images. We found that the deviation increased with the decrease in SIC value. The deviation is larger in the ice melting area and the ice edges area, but smaller in the area completely covered by ice. Compared with MOD29/MYD29 SICs, the SICs obtained in this study have higher accuracy, with an average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 7.64%. It can detect the details of relatively small leads, ice edges, and fragmented ice areas. The high-accuracy SIC product we obtained is expected to provide long-term SIC records of high quality.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-6 Altimetry Data over Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (S6-MF) satellite was launched on 21st November 2020. Poseidon-4, the main payload onboard S6-MF, is the first synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeter operating in an interleaved open burst mode. In this study, the sea surface height (SSH), significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed observations from the Poseidon-4 Level 2 altimetry products from November 2021 to October 2022 are assessed. The assessment contains synthetic aperture radar mode (SARM) as well as low-resolution mode (LRM) data. The SSH assessment is conducted using range noise, sea level anomaly (SLA) spectral analysis and crossover analysis, whereas the SWH and wind speed assessments are performed against NDBC buoy data and other satellite altimetry missions. The performance of the Sentinel-6 altimetry data is compared to those of Sentinel-3A/B and Jason-3 altimetry data. The 20 Hz range noise is 3.07 cm for SARM and 6.40 cm for LRM when SWH is 2 m. The standard deviation (STD) of SSH differences at crossovers is 3.76 cm for SARM and 4.27 cm for LRM. Compared against the NDBC measurements, the Sentinel-6 SWH measurements have a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.361 m for SARM and an RMSE of 0.225 m for LRM. The Sentinel-6 wind speed measurements show an RMSE of 1.216 m/s for SARM and an RMSE of 1.323 m/s for LRM. We also present the impacts of ocean waves on parameter retrievals from Sentinel-6 SARM data. The Sentinel-6 SARM data are sensitive to wave period and direction as well as vertical velocity. It should be paid attention to in the future.

TI  - Remote sensing image destriping based on variable weight and group sparse regularization
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Striping effects are common phenomena in remote sensing images, and they significantly limit subsequent applications. Although many destriping approaches have been developed, there aren't many that can completely eliminate complex stripes with varying levels of strength. To address this issue, we propose a stripe removal model based on a variable weight coefficient and group sparse regularization. Specifically, rather than a single scalar for the stripes in most approaches, different weights are set for different stripe rows to estimate the stripes with varying intensities. An adaptive method to estimate the weight matrix is proposed. On the other hand, group sparsity regularization is employed to constrain the entire stripe. In addition, region weights are designed for regions with different stripe characteristics. The alternating direction multiplier method is employed to solve the proposed model by alternating minimization. Experimental results based on simulation and real data demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other advanced methods in terms of stripe noise removal and image detail preservation.

AB  - Geosynchronous satellite observation images have the advantages of a wide observation range and high temporal resolution, which are critical for understanding atmospheric motion and change patterns. The realization of geosynchronous satellite observation image prediction will provide significant support for short-term forecasting, including precipitation forecasting. Here, this paper proposes a deep learning method for predicting satellite observation images that can perform the task of predicting satellite observation sequences. In the study of predicting the observed images for Band 9 of the FY-4A satellite, the average mean square error of the network's 2-h prediction is 4.77 Kelvin. The network's predictive performance is the best among multiple deep learning models. We also used the model to predict Bands 10-14 of the FY-4A satellite and combined the multi-band prediction results. To test the application potential of the network prediction performance, we ran a precipitation area detection task on the multi-band prediction results. After 2 h of prediction, the detection results from satellite infrared images still achieved an accuracy of 0.855.

TI  - An Assessment of the Influences of Clouds on the Solar Photovoltaic Potential over China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are important modulators of the solar radiation reaching the earth's surface. However, the impacts of cloud properties other than cloud cover are seldom mentioned. By combining the satellite-retrieved cloud properties, the latest radiative transfer model, and an advanced PVLIB-python software for solar photovoltaic (PV) estimation, the impacts of different types of clouds on the maximum available solar PV potential (measured with the plane-of-array-irradiance, POAI) are quantified. The impacts of ice and liquid water clouds are found to be the highest on Tibetan Plateau over western China in spring, and central and southern China in winter, respectively. The reduction of POAI by liquid water clouds is almost twice of that by ice clouds except for spring. It is found that the POAI can be reduced by 27-34% by all clouds (ice + liquid water clouds) in different seasons. The sensitivities of the solar PV potential to the changes in cloud properties including the cloud fraction, cloud top pressure, cloud effective radius, and cloud water path are also analyzed. Three kinds of settings of PV panel tilting, namely fixed tilt, one-axis tracking, and two-axis tracking, are considered. It is found that the cloud properties are essential to estimate the solar PV potentials, especially for the cloud fraction. The attenuation of solar radiation by clouds are growingly larger as the solar plane tilting settings get more complicated. The outlook of solar PV potential is quite variable as the changes in cloud properties are highly uncertain in the future climate scenarios.

TI  - Estimation of fractional coverage of alpine black soils by soybean vegetation using UAV-based multi-spectral images and vegetation indices
T2  - UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To extract accurately and quickly the fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) for the case of soybean crops in alpine black-soil regions during flowering-podding and seed-filling growth stages, we use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect multi-spectral images of the soybean crops. Different vegetation indices for the multi-spectral bands are analyzed and compared. These are a vegetative index (VEG), a colour index of vegetation extraction (CIVE), an excessive green-feature index (EXG), an excessive green-and-red difference index (EXGR), a combined vegetation index (CVI), a normalized green-blue difference index (NGBDI), a normalized vegetation index (NDVI), a soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and a modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI). A supervised classification method is combined with a threshold method based on statistical histograms of the vegetation indices. This offers an efficient technique for extracting the soybean coverage in the alpine black soils. We divide our experimental field into soil pixels and soybean pixels, while the UAV-based remote-sensing data is divided into the categories of soil and soybean vegetation, using a supervised classification method. Then intersects of the histograms of the vegetation-indices distributions derived with the UAV data are taken as thresholds for the soil and soybean-vegetation pixels. The soybean FVC extracted from synchronously collected high-resolution visible-light images with the ground resolution 0.036 m is used as a reference value for the comparative analysis of the accuracies. Our study reveals the following: (1) the FVC-extraction accuracy becomes higher than 90% if the thresholds of the vegetation indices are determined by the statistical histograms and the images obtained with the UAVs are classified in order to extract the FVC, (2) one obtains too high a coverage with the NGBDI index; the corresponding errors are equal to 6.14% and 2.18% respectively for the flowering-podding and seed-filling stages, (3) the COM, VEG, EXG, SAVI and MSAVI indices demonstrate a sufficient accuracy and reliability, and (4) the EXG index provides the highest precision at the podding stage, while the COM index is the best for the period of soybean-kernel filling. Our results represent an important reference for future high-precision extraction of the soybean-vegetation coverage at different growth stages.

TI  - Parcel-Level Mapping of Horticultural Crops in Mountain Areas Using Irregular Time Series and VHR Images Taking Qixia, China as An Example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable horticultural crop classification results are an important part of agricultural management. At present, research on orchard classification based on optical images in complex mountain areas is vulnerable to the influence of cloudy weather, especially in the summer, which leads to a lack of key phenological characteristics. To solve this problem, a parcel-level orchard mapping experiment with an irregular time series was carried out in Qixia City, China. Firstly, the candidate parcels in the study area were extracted from VHR images with a spatial resolution of 0.55 m based on RCF and DABNet models. The F1 score and area-based intersection-over-union (IoU) of the parcel extraction results were calculated. When the boundary buffer radius was 1 m, the F1 score was 0.93. When the radius was 2 m, the F1 score was 0.96. The IoU was 0.872, which shows the effectiveness of the parcel extraction method. Then, based on Sentinel-2 data, the NDVI, EVI, and SAVI vegetation indexes were calculated to construct an irregular time series. A two-dimensional CNN model was used for classification. In order to verify the effectiveness of this method, the study also constructed regular time series for the study area and conducted classification experiments using the 2DCNN and LSTM as classifiers, respectively. Confusion matrices were constructed for the classification results, and the overall accuracy was calculated. The results show that the overall accuracy of the method based on irregular time series is 97.76%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.96, higher than the other experiments, which indicates that the classification method based on irregular time series is effective and can make full use of the fragmented spectral features. Finally, based on the candidate parcels and pixel-level classification results of the study area, the crop categories of the parcels were filled to achieve accurate parcel-level mapping of horticultural crops in complex mountain areas. This method can provide a theoretical reference for orchard crop mapping and serves the development of regional precision agriculture.

TI  - A New Cloud and Haze Mask Algorithm From Radiative Transfer Simulations Coupled With Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mainstream satellite cloud masking algorithms are prone to mis-masking in haze-polluted areas, which may cause errors in aerosol radiative effect calculations and attribution of surface solar radiance changes; thereby, distinguishing between clouds and haze is critical to obtaining accurate land and atmospheric data products. Existing cloud and haze mask algorithms based on the threshold method may require us to spend a lot of manpower to perform multiple threshold tests; in addition, the obtained thresholds are only applicable to particular sensors, which limits the generality of the threshold-based cloud and haze mask algorithms. In this study, a new cloud and haze mask algorithm based on a combination of radiative transfer simulations and machine learning simulation-based cloud and haze masking (SCHM) is proposed and applied to MODIS images. When we simulated the apparent reflectance of the first seven visible and near-infrared channels of MODIS, the CALIOP and AERONET data verification results showed that the SCHM algorithm achieved 85.16% and 90.08% hit rates for cloud and haze recognition, respectively. When we added three thermal infrared channels (20, 31, and 35 bands) for simulation, the cloud and haze hit rates were improved to approximately 85.72% and 90.62%, respectively. This indicates that the SCHM algorithm can improve the accuracy of detection results by improving the radiative transfer simulation parameters. Compared with existing threshold-based methods, the SCHM algorithm has the advantages of simple logic, convenient modification, and flexible configuration.

T2  - Journal of cancer research and therapeutics
M3  - Observational Study
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was the standard in breast cancer with axillary involvement until recently. Along with the number of metastatic nodes, axillary positivity was considered a main prognostic factor and scientific evidence shows that the administration of radiotherapy on ganglion areas decreases the risk of recurrence even in positive axilla. The objective of this study was to evaluate the axillary treatment in patients with positive axilla at diagnosis, the evolution of them over time, and to assess patient's follow-up with the aim of avoiding the morbidity associated with axillary dissection.Methods: A retrospective observational study of breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2017 was performed. In total, 1,100 patients were studied, out of which 168 were women with clinically and histologically positive axilla at diagnosis. Seventy-six percent received primary chemotherapy and subsequent treatment with sentinel node biopsy, axillary dissection, or both. Patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy received either radiotherapy or lymphadenectomy depending on the year time they were diagnosed.Results: For 60 patients out of 168, neoadjuvant chemotherapy resulted in a complete pathological axillary response. Axillary recurrence was registered for six patients. No recurrence was detected in the biopsy group associated with radiotherapy. These results support the benefit of lymph node radiotherapy for patients with positive sentinel node biopsy after receiving primary chemotherapy.Conclusion: Sentinel node biopsy provides useful and reliable information about cancer staging and might prevent lymphadenectomy, leading to a decrease in morbidity. Pathological response to systemic treatment came out as the most important predictive factor of disease-free survival of breast cancer.

TI  - Sentinel-6A attitude modeling with dual GNSS antennas and its impact on precise orbit determination
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-6 mission aims to provide high-precision ocean altimetry measurements. Altimeter processing relies on highly accurate knowledge of satellite position and attitude. For precise orbit determination (POD), the Sentinel-6A spacecraft is equipped with a dual-constellation global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver and dual GNSS POD antennas. The satellite attitude is indispensable for connecting the satellite body reference frame and the inertial system. The actual satellite attitude is determined from the dual-antenna-based orbit differences and the antenna baseline information. We developed a yaw-attitude model for Sentinel-6A based on 75 days of data in 2021. Single-receiver ambiguity resolution is carried out to further explore the orbit determination accuracy. Different orbits, including the global positioning system (GPS)-only, Galileo-only, GPS/Galileo-combined orbits related to the GNSS POD antenna and orbit based on the data collected by the GNSS radio occultation (GNSS-RO) POD antenna (GNSS-RO orbit), are generated and their consistency is analyzed to investigate the impact of the attitude model and ambiguity resolution on POD. With the established model, the consistency between orbits determined using dual-antenna observations is improved by 41, 70 and 53% in along-track, cross-track and radial directions with respect to the nominal attitude. Compared with the GPS/Galileo-combined solution, the 3D RMS errors of the GPS-only and Galileo-only solutions are better than 4 and 3 mm, and a 12.6 mm RMS is obtained for the GNSS-RO orbit. The STD of satellite laser ranging (SLR) residuals for GPS/Galileo-combined solutions is improved from 14 mm with nominal attitude to 9 mm with the established attitude model. A 10 mm consistency of GNSS-RO, GPS-only and Galileo-only orbits with SLR observations is also achieved.

TI  - F-UNet plus plus : Remote Sensing Image Fusion Based on Multipurpose Adaptive Shuffle Attention and Composite Multi-Input Reconstruction Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images is of great significance for the construction of high-resolution remote sensing images. Because of differences in sensors, no single MS or PAN image can express the complete information of a scene. Therefore, it is a key issue to fuse MS images containing rich spectral content and PAN images with spatial information to construct a high-resolution MS image. In this work, an adaptive shuffle attention (ASA) module and an optimized UNet++ are combined in a fusion-UNet++ (F-UNet++) framework for the problem of MS and PAN image fusion. This ASA module can focus on important information in the mixed domain and adjust the dimensions of tensors. F-UNet++ includes a multiscale feature extraction module, multiscale feature fusion module, and image reconstruction module. The multiscale feature extraction module obtains spectral and spatial information, the multiscale feature fusion module fuses spectral and spatial information, and a composite multi-input image reconstruction module (CMI-UNet++) reconstructs the final image. By combining the ASA attention module, the loss of feature information can be reduced to enhance the fidelity of the spectral and spatial information of the fused image. Experiments show that F-UNet++ is qualitatively and quantitatively superior to current image fusion methods. (The code is available at https://github.com/Josephing/F-UNet).

TI  - Detection and Identification of Preseismic Thermal Anomalies in Cloudy Conditions Associated With the 2022 Luding (China) Mw 6.6 Earthquake
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past three decades, thermal anomalies from satellite infrared data have been widely discussed and associated with earthquakes. Besides infrared satellite data, the recent use of passive microwave satellite data has emerged as an important dataset to detect the potential thermal anomalies prior to earthquakes in all weather conditions due to its capability to monitor the earth in cloudy and foggy conditions and has been applied to the numerous strong earthquake events around the world. On September 5, 2022, an 6.6 earthquake occurred in Luding County, nearby Mt. Gongga, China, with heavy cloud coverage over the epicenter and its surrounding region before and after the event. In this study, the microwave brightness temperature (MWBT) and clear-sky outgoing longwave radiation (ClrOLR) data were used together to identify the potential seismic thermal anomalies. Prominent anomalous signals were detected around the epicenter, appearing within two months preceding the earthquake. Further analysis was conducted through the combination of other parameters from satellite and ground observations, including precipitation (PR), cloud fraction (CloudFrc), and soil moisture (SM), in order to verify and better understand the detected anomalous signals. Our results suggest that the combination of MWBT and ClrOLR can be used as an effective tool to detect thermal anomalies associated with earthquake events in cloudy conditions over the epicenter.

TI  - A Rigorously-Incremental Spatiotemporal Data Fusion Method for Fusing Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal remote sensing images have significant importance in forest ecological monitoring, forest carbon management, and other related fields. Spatiotemporal data fusion technology of remote sensing images combines high spatiotemporal and high temporal resolution images to address the current limitation of single sensors in obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution. This technology has gained widespread attention in recent years. However, the current models still exhibit some shortcomings in dealing with land cover changes, such as poor clustering results, inaccurate incremental spatiotemporal calculations, and sensor differences. In this article, we propose a rigorously-incremental spatiotemporal data fusion method for fusing remote sensing images with different resolutions to address the aforementioned problems. The proposed method utilizes the particle swarm optimization Gaussian mixture model to extract endmembers and establishes a linear relationship between sensors to obtain accurate time increments. Furthermore, bicubic interpolation is used instead of thin plate spline interpolation for spatial interpolation, and also support vector regression is used to calculate weights for obtaining a weighted sum of temporal and spatial increments. In addition, sensor errors are allocated to the calculation of residuals. The experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm for fusing fine image Landsat with coarse image MODIS data and conclude that the proposed algorithm presents a better solution for heterogeneous data with strong phenological changes and regions with changes in surface types, which provides a better solution for remote sensing image fusion and, hence, improves the accuracy, stability, and robustness of data fusion.

TI  - Light Intensity Required for the Spring Phytoplankton Bloom in the East Sea
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Light is one of the primary resources in regulating phytoplankton growth and productivity. Recent satellite observations have started to report optimal light intensities for phytoplankton blooming in various physiological and ecological environments. To investigate the optimal light intensities required for phytoplankton spring bloom development in the East Sea (ES), we constructed a 10-year climatology of the mean photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) in the mixed layer at the onset times of spring blooms using satellite data and in situ temperature- depth profiles. The PAR estimates in the southern ES (<40 degrees N) are nearly uniform, with an optimal value of 4.5 +/- 2.1 E m(-2) day(-1); this value is comparable to the PAR in the western North Pacific and the North Atlantic, where bloom initiation has been explained by a shallowing of the mixed layer depth and an increase in the light availability. The PAR estimates for the northern ES are also nearly uniform, with an optimal value of 16.0 +/- 7.3 E m(-2) day(-1). However, the PAR is about three times larger in the northern ES than in the southern ES. The value of the northern ES is comparable to the PAR estimate in the Southern Ocean, which is known as a high-nutrient and low-chlorophyll region, owing to iron limitation and zooplankton grazing pressures. These distinct regional differences in the PAR estimates indicate that a variety of physiological and ecological conditions can control the onset of spring blooms.

AB  - Cloud computing and remote sensing are important to increase agricultural production and reducing input losses. Despite the growth in studies using cloud computing in agriculture with remote sensing data, an overview and growth in this research domain are unknown. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to provide a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of the existing literature in the area of cloud computing in agriculture using remote sensing data. A total of 331 articles from 1 January 2010 to 30 October 2022 were downloaded from the web of science (WOS) database for further analysis. The downloaded information included authors, title, year of publication, citations, keywords plus, journals and citations. The results indicated growth in studies by 42.14% and the mean total citations increased from 1 in 2010 to 14 in 2021. Remote sensing was the top-ranked journal with 19 articles and internet, big data and management are the major keywords obtained from publications in this research domain. The study broadens the body of knowledge in this field by offering theoretical contributions to current literature. This knowledge charts a future for future researchers in cloud computing for agriculture and this is vital to researchers to innovate new ways of analysing data for future enhancement of agricultural practices which is vital for sustainable agricultural development.

TI  - Surface Instability Mapping in Alpine Paraglacial Environments Using Sentinel-1 DInSAR Techniques
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current climate warming leads to widespread glacier shrinkage in high alpine terrains and associated changes in surface dynamics of deglacierized environments. In consequence, slope instabilities increasingly develop along retreating glaciers through debuttressing effects or degrading permafrost conditions. In the context of associated hazards to the local environment and infrastructure, a thorough analysis of slope instabilities is highly relevant. Affected regions are mostly inaccessible and cover large areas, therefore remote sensing techniques such as differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) are valuable tools to monitor surface movements and assess their evolution. We apply standard and advanced DInSAR methods using Sentinel-1 SAR data from 2015 until late 2021 to map and classify slope instabilities in three glacierized regions in the European Alps. The final products include an inventory per region, with a total of 815 mapped slope instabilities, of which 38% move <3, 9% move 3-10, 42% move 10-30, and 11% move >30 cm/yr. An additional assessment of four landslides occurring along shrinking glaciers shows time series with recent accelerations in 2018/19. Validation of Sentinel-1 derived slope movement products is performed by comparison with shorter wavelength TerraSAR-X and optical Sentinel-2 derived data using offset tracking. Results clearly show the suitability of Sentinel-1 DInSAR methods to detect a range of slope movements in high alpine terrain, yet also highlight the limitations. We therefore recommend a combination of advanced Sentinel-1 DInSAR and Sentinel-2 offset tracking methods to develop a comprehensive inventory of alpine slope motion.

TI  - WRITING AS A MODEL OF CULTURAL SEDIMENTATION AND MEMORY: FERRARIS, DERRIDA AND HUSSERL
T2  - HORIZON-FENOMENOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite their creativity, cultural actions are not established out of nothing. They are based on previous actions, their passive or active memory, and extension. Sedimentation is the depositing of sediments that occurs during certain processes. They testify to the processes that have taken place and themselves become significant links or traces. Different layers of sediment are formed, which testify to past events, which have structures in the present. The best-known phenomenological concept of sedimentation was formulated in Husserl's text The Origin of Geometry. Husserl uses the specific geological term of sedimentation to describe the science of geometry as a linguistically (written) mediated genesis of conceptual knowledge. The human practice of knowledge can be transmitted to other generations only by expressing it linguistically and recording it in writing. Derrida used the phenomenological concept of sedimentation and created Grammatology. Maurizio Ferraris applied these ideas of Derrida while developing the theory of documentality. The main idea of documentality is that a particular kind of social objects, namely documents (records of social acts) are the ground of social reality. For all three philosophers, writing or recording becomes a model for reflecting on cultural-social reality. The pur-pose of this article is to discuss the writing as a model for cultural sedimentation and memory. Husserl understood writing as a sedimentation that must be reactivated. However, Derrida and Ferraris identi-fy the written objects only with materialized writing and the repetition of what is written. They do not distinguish between imitative and comprehensive reading.

TI  - Improved Automatic Classification of Litho-Geomorphological Units by Using Raster Image Blending, Vipava Valley (SW Slovenia)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic landslide classification based on digital elevation models has become a powerful complementary tool to field mapping. Many studies focus on the automatic classification of landslides' geomorphological features, such as their steep main scarps, but in many cases, the scarps and other morphological features are difficult for algorithms to detect. In this study, we performed an automatic classification of different litho-geomorphological units to differentiate slope mass movements in field maps by using Maximum Likelihood Classification. The classification was based on high-resolution lidar-derived DEM of the Vipava Valley, SW Slovenia. The results show an improvement over previous approaches as we used a blended image (VAT, which included four different raster layers with different weights) along with other common raster layers for morphometric analysis of the surface (e.g., slope, elevation, aspect, TRI, curvature, etc.). The newly created map showed better classification of the five classes we used in the study and recognizes alluvial deposits, carbonate cliffs (including landslide scarps), carbonate plateaus, flysch, and slope deposits better than previous studies. Multivariate statistics recognized the VAT layer as the most important layer with the highest eigenvalues, and when combined with Aspect and Elevation layers, it explained 90% of the total variance. The paper also discusses the correlations between the different layers and which layers are better suited for certain geomorphological surface analyses.

AB  - Crop discrimination is a general application of hyperspectral remote sensing with supervised learning-based classification being the approach of choice. The quality of classification is substantially influenced by the atmospheric impacts on the radiance recorded. The primary goal of atmospheric correction is to extract from remotely sensed data of the target's surface reflectance or emittance values. We have assessed the influence of different atmospheric correction schemes on the quality of crop discrimination using airborne hyperspectral imagery acquired on a site in the Anand district of Gujarat. The variation of the classification performance as obtained from different machine learning algorithms has been assessed for quantifying the influence of different perspectives of atmospheric corrections on the hyperspectral imagery for crop classification. Results indicate a strong dependence on the classification of crops, especially with the imagery corrected using statistically dominant atmospheric correction methods. Despite marginal differences across the various radiative transfer modelling (RTM)-based models, a general trend of higher-level classification performance in crop classification indicates a uniform distribution of load factors and image quality metrics. Accuracy estimates from the imagery corrected using a semi-empirical model (e.g., QUAC) are only marginally lesser than the radiative transfer models while offering great flexibility in terms of computational requirements and scope for automated image correction. So, at times, an empirical model can also be a better method for atmospheric correction.

TI  - Effect of Neural Tissue Mobilization on Sensory-Motor Impairments in Breast Cancer Survivors with Lymphedema: An Experimental Study.
T2  - Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Randomized Controlled Trial
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast surgery, Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND), radiation and chemotherapy may develop several complications such as axillary web syndrome, frozen shoulder, numbness, shoulder pain and range of motion restriction, lymphostasis, and lymphedema. Up to 77% report sensory disturbance in the breast or arm after breast surgery. These short- and long-term consequences have dramatic impact on physical function and quality of life in this population.AIMS: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of neural tissue mobilization on sensory-motor impairments in breast cancer survivors with lymphedema.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study was carried out by analyzing total 100 breast cancer survivor women, with lymphedema aged between 30-65 years of age who had undergone breast surgery mostly lumpectomy along with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Participants were divided into two groups by random allocation. One group underwent neurodynamic mobilization and the other group conventional physiotherapy.The treatment protocol was given for 6 weeks. Parameters such ROM, pain, lymphedema and sensory-motor impairments were assessed at the baseline before the treatment and 6 weeks after the treatment.RESULT: The result from this study shows that there is significant improvement (p<0.0001, t-value 4.69) in mTNS of patients undergoing neural tissue mobilization,whereas there was no significant improvement (p=0.05, t-value 1.951) seen in patients undergoing conventional physiotherapy.CONCLUSION: This study concludes that effect of neural tissue mobilization has significant impact on sensory motor impairments as compared to conventional treatment protocol in breast cancer survivors with lymphedema.Pain and ROM showed similar difference with both the treatment protocols. It was also observed that patients with mild and moderate lymphedema showed significant improvement as compared to patients with severe lymphedema.

TI  - Neural Network Fusion Processing and Inverse Mapping to Combine Multisensor Satellite Data and Analyze the Prominent Features
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, the increase of active and passive earth observation satellites has provided us with more remote sensing data. This fact has led to enhanced interest in the fusion of different satellite data since some of the satellites have properties complementary to others. Fusion techniques can improve the estimation in areas of interest by using the complementary information and inferring unknown parameters. They also have the potential to provide high-resolution detailed classification maps. Thus, we propose a neural network, which combines and analyzes the data obtained from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical sensors to provide high-resolution classification maps. The neural network employs a novel activation function to construct a neural network explainability method termed as inverse mapping for prominent feature analysis. By applying inverse mapping to the data fusion neural network, we can understand which input features are the prominent contributors for which classification outputs. Inverse mapping realizes backward signal flow based on teacher-signal backpropagation dynamics, which is consistent with its forward processing. It performs the contribution analysis of the data pixel by pixel and class by class. In this article, we focus on earthquake damage detection by dealing with SAR and optical sensor data of the 2018 Sulawesi earthquake in Indonesia. The fusion-based results show increased classification accuracy compared to the results of independent sensors. Moreover, we observe that inverse mapping shows reasonable explanations in a consistent manner. It also indicates the contributions of features different from straightforward counterparts, namely, pre- and post-seismic features, in the detection of particular classes.

TI  - A Simple Lossless Algorithm for On-Board Satellite Hyperspectral Data Compression
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the resolution of the on-board imaging spectrometer keeps improving, the data acquisition rate increases and a resource-limited satellite environment necessitates for computationally simple data compression methods to meet timing, bandwidth, and resource requirements with error resilience. This letter proposes a new lossless (LS), prediction-based algorithm for on-board satellite hyperspectral data compression that utilizes spectral as well as spatial correlation and at the same time, is computationally less complex. The concept of non-binary tree traversal (NBTT) is used with the nearest neighbor (NN) method and implemented using neighbor-driven decision-making (NDDM) in the pre-processing stage. Previously processed pixels are used to minimize the prediction residual, which makes more than 80% of calculations causal in nature and thereby reducing the computational complexity of the algorithm. The prediction residual is then encoded using sample adaptive Golomb coding in band-sequential order. Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) corpus of data for hyperspectral images (HSI) is used for evaluating the performance of the algorithm. The proposed method shows reduced computational complexity and lesser data dependencies compared to the CCSDS 123.0-B-1 standard when similar spectral vicinity is considered, and comparable compression performance compared to other state-of-the-art on-board LS compression methods.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a standard practice for staging cutaneous melanoma. High false-negative rates have an increased interest in adjunctive techniques for localizing SLNs. Mobile gamma cameras (MGCs) represent potential tools to enhance SLNB performance.METHODS: An institutional review board approval was obtained for this study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01531608). After obtaining informed consent, 20 eligible melanoma patients underwent 99mTc sulfur colloid injection and standard lymphoscintigraphy with a fixed gamma camera (FGC). A survey using a 20cm square MGC, performed immediately preoperatively by the study surgeon, was used to establish an operative plan while blinded to the FGC results. Subsequently, SLNB was performed using a gamma probe and a novel 6cm diameter handheld MGC.RESULTS: A total of 24 SLN basins were detected by FGC. Prior to unblinding, all 24 basins were identified with the preoperative MGC and the operative plan established by preoperative MGC imaging was confirmed accurate by review of the FGC images. All individual sentinel lymph nodes were identified during intraoperative MGC imaging, and in 5/24 (21%) cases, surgeon-reported additional clinically useful information was obtained from the MGC.CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative MGC images provide information consistent with FGC images for planning SLNB and in some cases provide additional information that aided in surgical decision-making.

TI  - Region-Growing-Based Automatic Localized Adaptive Thresholding Algorithm for Water Extraction Using Sentinel-2 MSI Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is a distinct land cover feature on the Earth. Water can easily be extracted from satellite data under known/controlled conditions using simple thresholding techniques. However, these pixel thresholding techniques fail when applied over large regions because they cannot adapt the thresholds based on local variability. Although region-growing methods are available to overcome this issue, there is a limitation in using a global threshold value determined for a satellite scene. Such thresholds fail to adapt to the variations within the scene. Hence, this study proposed a new region-growing-based approach for improved classification of water features using Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) data. The significant difference between this approach and other region-growing methods is that this technique uses dynamic thresholding for localized adaption. The local image statistics of the normalized difference water index (NDWI) layer are used for adding new pixels to the region, and the threshold is adjusted for every new pixel added. This technique also minimizes manual intervention in water classification, thus enabling total process automation in near real time. The thresholds are dynamically determined not only for each scene but also for each new pixel being classified for the accurate delineation of the water pixels. A rigorous quality evaluation was done on the resultant water layer. This technique achieved an overall accuracy of 84.04% in challenging conditions.

AB  - Emergence of small satellites for earth observation missions has opened up new horizons for space research but at the same time posed newer challenges of limited power and compute resource arising out of the size & weight constraints imposed by these satellites. The currently evolving neuromorphic computing paradigm shows promise in terms of energy efficiency and may possibly be exploited here. In this paper, we try to prove the applicability of neuromorphic computing for on-board data processing in satellites by creating a 2-stage hierarchical cloud cover detection application for multi-spectral earth observation images. We design and train a CNN and convert it into SNN using the CNN2SNN conversion toolkit of Brainchip Akida neuromorphic platform. We achieve 95.46% accuracy while power consumption and latency are at least 35x and 3.4x more efficient respectively in stage-1 (and 230x & 7x in stage-2) compared to the equivalent CNN running on Jetson TX2.

TI  - Extent of Lake Tana's Papyrus Swamps (1985-2020), North Ethiopia
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Tana is the largest freshwater lake in Ethiopia and is the source of the Blue Nile. The lake shorelines and those of its tributary river, Gilgel Abay, are characterized by the occurrence of extensive papyrus swamps (Cyperus papyrus L). While such papyrus swamps are highly recognized for their outstanding ecological and economical importance, their historical and current spatial distribution and size in the Lake Tana sub basin have not yet been systematically assessed. The primary goal of this study was to estimate the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of papyrus swamps in the Lake Tana sub basin at five-year intervals over a period of 35 years (1985-2020). Our analyses revealed that the total surface area of the papyrus swamps in the study area declined by almost 55% (from 152 km(2) to 64 km(2)) during the last 35 years. The small patches of papyrus swamps that existed in the northern and eastern parts of the study area prior to the 1990s appear to have disappeared in recent years as well. Our data suggest that the strong decline of papyrus swamps mainly resulted from the expansion of crop farming, livestock overgrazing, drainage, and biomass overharvesting, all of which are increasing over time.

TI  - Adjuvant radiotherapy in the management of porocarcinoma with lymphatic micrometastasis
T2  - ONCOLOGY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Porocarcinoma is a rare skin tumor originating from dermal sweat glands. Surgical procedures are the first choice of treatment, but the role of adjuvant therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT), is not clear. In this case report and review of the literature, we aimed to present a patient who underwent adjuvant RT for the diagnosis of porocarcinoma with lymphatic micrometastasis and a review of the current literature. Case summary. A 61-year-old male was admitted to the dermatology department for a nodular lesion on the left knee skin. An excisional biopsy was performed, and the pathology result was reported as porocarcinoma. The closest surgical margin of the tumor was 0.2 cm. In the inguinal sentinel lymph node sampling, two of the three removed lymph nodes had micrometastases. Then, adjuvant RT was applied to the left inguinofemoral lymphat- ics and primary tumor bed. No recurrence was observed in the patient with a follow-up period of 24 months. No acute or late toxicity was observed including lymphedema, subcutaneous fibrosis, or stiffness of the knee joint. Conclusions. Although adjuvant RT is not a routinely recommended treatment, it can be applied to increase lo- cal and regional control in patients with high-risk factors for recurrence or with lymph node metastases. There is a great need for clinical studies clarifying the role of RT, but for now, all patients should undergo multidisciplinary evaluation when a decision on adjuvant therapies is made.

TI  - Monitoring of Inland Excess Water Inundations Using Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, climate change not only leads to riverine floods and flash floods but also to inland excess water (IEW) inundations and drought due to extreme hydrological processes. The Carpathian Basin is extremely affected by fast-changing weather conditions during the year. IEW (sometimes referred to as water logging) is formed when, due to limited runoff, infiltration, and evaporation, surplus water remains on the surface or in places where groundwater flowing to lower areas appears on the surface by leaking through porous soil. In this study, eight different machine learning approaches were applied to derive IEW inundations on three different dates in 2021 (23 February, 7 March, 20 March). Index-based approaches are simple and provide relatively good results, but they need to be adapted to specific circumstances for each area and date. With an overall accuracy of 0.98, a Kappa of 0.65, and a QADI score of 0.020, the deep learning method Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) gave the best results, compared to the more traditional machine learning approaches Maximum Likelihood (ML), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) that were evaluated. The CNN-based IEW maps can be used in operational inland excess water control by water management authorities.

T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article demonstrates that the issues of maintaining cultural and ethnic autonomy, as well as the development of school and higher education for national minorities remain unresolved in China. Schools and universities shape the worldview of children through the values that they convey, performing the function of strengthening the national identity. The gradual transformation of national minorities into Chinese citizens is the main educational task. At the same time, public education is entrusted with the duty of preserving the culture of ethnic minorities within the framework of the dominance of dominated - Han culture, its civilizational project. A situation is being created to reproduce the concepts of cultural inequality with the explicit promotion of national unity. Meanwhile, for the state, the development of higher education of national minorities is especially important, since it is aimed at creating a trustworthy, loyal middle class of national minorities, capable of serving as a kind of `intermediaries' between the PRC government and the population of autonomous regions. The geopolitical strategy "One Belt One Road" announced in 2013 put the PRC in front of the need to raise the level of education and civil motivation of national minorities (especially those living on the western, southwestern and southeastern borders of the country), since these territories are key to the development of the transport system according to the Strategy. The article analyzes the corresponding document adopted in PRC - "Decision on accelerating the development of ethnic education" as the possibility of a partial solution to the problem of national minorities in China, in particular, in the field of education regarding the stimulation of obtaining an education in this population

TI  - Variability of the Water-Leaving Radiance under the Conditions of Dust Transport by the Satellite<i> Sentinel</i>-3 Data on the Example of the Black Sea and Sevastopol
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The meteorological situation in November 2021 has resulted in forming the conditions for intensive dust aerosol transfer to the Black Sea region. Intensive precipitation has contributed to the subsequent deposition of dust particles on the Black Sea surface layer and in its coastal zone. The work is purposed at comprehensive studying the case of abnormally intense precipitation in Sevastopol with a storm wind speed up to 27 m/s for November 29-30, 2021 using satellite and ground -based monitoring means for assessing the aerosol impact on the sea and atmosphere optical characteristics in the region under study. Methods and Results. For November 29 and 30, 2021, the calculated concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 particles were measured in the atmosphere over Sevastopol by the ATMAS dust meter. To determine the source of aerosol transport by means of a cyclone, the results of calculating the back trajectories of air mass transfer were analyzed. The trajectories were obtained using the HYSPLIT and AERONET models software package for Sevastopol. Comprehensive analysis of satellite and field data has resulted in recording the atmospheric aerosol transfer by dust. A comparative analysis of the data on concentrations of the PM10, PM2.5 particles and dust based on the SILAM model and field data, confirmed the dust aerosol transfer from Africa to the Black Sea region. The data of the WRF (Weather and Research Forecasting) modeling of the transfer event on 29.11.2021 testify to the fact that in the western part of the Black Sea, the concentration of dust particles was up to 2000 & mu;g/m-3 (in the same part of the sea, before the dust transfer, the dust concentration did not exceed 50 & mu;g/m-3). On 30.11.2021, the dust plume shifted to the eastern region. To assess the absorption contribution to the value of water-leaving radiance of the sea surface layer, the data on the optical characteristics for the cases of dust transport (21.11.2021) and clear atmosphere (02.12.2021) were analyzed. The main optical and microphysical characteristics of the atmospheric aerosol during the period under study were analyzed using the data of portable solar photometers of the AERONET network. Basic information on the aerosol transfer and its type was obtained due to the data of the MODIS-Aqua, VIIRS, Sentinel and CALIPSO satellite platforms. To confirm the dust transfer from Africa, presented were the results of modeling the reverse trajectories of air flow movement performed using the HYSPLIT and AERONET software package for the Black Sea stations Section_7 (Romania), Galata_Platform (Bulgaria) and Sevastopol (Russia). Conclusions. Study of the water-leaving radiance values based on the satellite and ground-based measurements performed at the wavelength 443 nm shows that in the presence of an absorbing aerosol, the contribution of sea brightness to the total signal becomes smaller as compared to the brightness coefficients for a background day and for a day with clear atmosphere (content of the aerosol particles is minimal). The sea water-leaving radiance constitutes 5% of the total radiance for a day with clear atmosphere, 2% - for a background day, and 1% - for a day with an absorbing aerosol in the atmosphere.

TI  - Physics-Based Fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 for Higher Resolution Vegetation Monitoring
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring vegetation growth, phenology, and health in agriculture requires very high spatial and spectral resolution sensors. Sentinel-2 is among the spaceborne sensors that tried to meet these requirements. However, due to physical constraints, few visible bands are present with relatively large spectral responses, which limits the leaf pigment content estimation. In this work, we propose to fuse Sentinel-2 bands with a Sentinel-3 image, which has a lower spatial resolution but contains several spectral narrower bands in both the visible and near-infrared (NIR) domains. The fusion procedure consists in sharpening the Sentinel-3 bands to match the Sentinel-2 spatial resolution leading to a higher spatial resolution Sentinel-3 image. The proposed fusion technique follows a physics-based approach based on the use of a radiative transfer model (RTM) for establishing a correspondence between Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images. In greater details, the main spectrally pure constituent of each high-resolution Sentinel-2 pixel is identified for each pixel, and it is then related to the corresponding low-resolution Sentinel-3 pixel. Pure materials are the barycenters of clusters obtained by an unsupervised classification of the Sentinel-2 image. Sentinel-3 signatures are obtained using coarse resolution pixel matching with the Sentinel-2 image. The latter result is then corrected using radiative transfer modeling allowing the production of more realistic signatures. Validation was done using real Sentinel-2/Sentinel-3 images taken with a delay of only one day or less and by comparing the sharpened Sentinel-3 bands Oa04, Oa06, Oa08, and Oa17 with the corresponding Sentinel-2 bands B2, B3, B4, and B8A, as they are, respectively, spectrally close. For all the bands, the rms is lower than 0.007, and compared with the state-of-the-art techniques, it shows competitive results and robustness against scene heterogeneity. Besides, our findings prove that the retrieved Sentinel-3 signatures at full resolution (FR) are physically consistent and in good agreement with the Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Emotional intelligence development: the implementation of transformative learning through digital technologies in tourism-a study protocol
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY ENHANCED LEARNING
M3  - Article
AB  - In today's era of globalisation and intense competition between tourism businesses, employees distinguished for their emotional abilities, good interpersonal relationships and teamwork, contribute to the quality and efficiency of the provided services. In this regard, the need for new training and educational programs in Emotional Intelligence in the tourism sector is more than ever relevant, as tourism businesses demand graduates that can be more efficient and capable of servicing and satisfying customers. Moreover, the new challenges that arise in education and training lead to the adaption of digital learning environments, and new teaching methods. Furthermore, Transformative Learning, as an adult learning theory, leads individuals, through critical reflection and constructive dialogue, to evaluate their past values and beliefs and shift their worldview implementing new perspectives and attitudes which are more functional. The purpose of this protocol study is to investigate the learning effectiveness of Transformation Learning as a pedagogical tool for the development of Emotional Intelligence for tourism employees, through digital learning technologies.

TI  - "Man Cannot Detach Oneself from the Epoch": Bohumil Hrabal and Worldview
T2  - FILOSOFICKY CASOPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper focuses on the intellectual aspects of Bohumil Hrabal's work and also on the concept of worldview. The starting point is Josef Zumr's article "The Intellectual Inspiration of Bohumil Hrabal" (1989); the approaches of Jan Patocka (1942) and Jan Mukarovsky (1947) are also mentioned. In his article Zumr presents Hrabal's worldview as a mosaic of constitutive and affirmative influences. He formulates a thesis on the post-war continuity of the avant-garde, of which Hrabal's work is a part. In this paper, Zumr's interpretation is subjected to partial revision: it is not only about ideological influences, but also about their individual creative transformation. Hrabal has lost the optimism of the avant-garde, his work testifies to the turn of an epoch and combines humour with melancholy and historical scepticism.

TI  - Detection of Cookie Bomb Attacks in Cloud Computing Environment Monitored by SIEM
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a new method to detect Cookie Bomb attacks. A Cookie Bomb attack is a denial-of-service attack such that a user cannot receive a legitimate Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response from an HTTP server because the total amount of cookies in an HTTP request exceeds the size limit accepted by the HTTP server. The new method includes our cloud architecture and detection algorithms. The cloud architecture distributes and executes a detection script, which is an implementation of the detection algorithms. This architecture uses Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Storage, Azure Automation, Azure Monitor, and Microsoft Sentinel. The virtual machines are the core components of the architecture, to which end users can connect via RDP to use their browsers. The detection script performs three tasks: obtaining paths to cookies databases generated by browsers, retrieving cookies data from a database, and comparing a threshold with the total size of all cookies a browser sends to a server. Results indicate that our proposed method 1) enables scheduled automation, 2) provides better visibility across regions, and 3) expands detection coverage for different Windows users, browsers, and browser profiles.

TI  - Design of a Single Circular Radiator With Multiple Patterns for a UWB Three-Axis Monopulse System
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a single radiator multiple patterns (SRMP) antenna that utilizes a single circular disc radiator to provide multiple radiation patterns that are suitable for ultra-wideband (UWB) direction-finding. The antenna design includes a circular disc and a ground structure for broadband characteristics and a slot structure to reduce mutual coupling. In addition, we simplify the UWB direction-finding system by employing a monopulse method that uses only sum and difference patterns rather than the sensitive phase difference of arrival (PDoA) method. The coordinates for conventional monopulse systems are converted into alpha-, beta-, and y-axes that are more suitable for the proposed SRMP antenna. Then, the monopulse ratios on each of the three axes, obtained using sum and difference patterns, are then compared to the simulation and ideal results. To verify the feasibility, the proposed SRMP antenna is fabricated, and antenna characteristics, such as reflection coefficients, mutual couplings, and radiation patterns are measured in a full anechoic chamber. To examine the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation using the proposed antenna, we use the monopulse ratios calculated based on the measured data in the z alpha-, z beta-, and zy-planes. The maximum RMS error is reduced to 0.105 using the three-axis monopulse system within the angle range from -15 degrees to 15 degrees. The results confirm that the proposed SRMP antenna is suitable for the UWB three-axis monopulse direction finding.

TI  - Assessing the Effects of Fuel Moisture Content on the 2018 Megafires in California
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2018, the megafire episodes on record occurred in California, causing a large number of civilian deaths and damages. As an important part of the "fire environment triangle," the fuel moisture content (FMC) of both live (LFMC) and dead (DFMC) vegetation were broadly accepted as the important drivers of wildfire ignition and spread, but their effects on the 2018 megafires in California were less explored. Here, we explored and compared the effects of LFMC and DFMC on the 2018 megafire in California, allowing for highlighting the role of different types of FMC in megafire risk assessment. The LFMC was collected from the global LFMC product. We used three indices obtained from the Canadian Forest Service Fire Weather Index Rating System as a proxy of DFMC products, including the fine fuel moisture code, duff moisture code (DMC), and drought code. We analyzed the long-term series (2001-2018) of these four indices in California to test whether these indices were indicative of the occurrence of the megafire, and which of the index was the most powerful driving the 2018 megafires. The results showed that all these indices were correlated with the fires in California. The LFMC showed the highest correlation with the fire occurrence between 2001 and 2018, whereas the DMC performed a major role in driving the 2018 megafire in California. This study presented the insights that the LFMC and DMC should be carefully considered in future operational fire risk assessments for megafire prescription, suppression, and response.

T2  - GEODETSKI VESTNIK
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the usefulness of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite imagery for determining the start, end, and length of the growing season of selected deciduous tree species. Vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery provide consistent observations in a similar temporal sequence and are useful for determining phenological phases. Using time series of NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) vegetation index from MODIS imagery, phenological patterns were detected at several points in Slovenia and different approaches to determine seasonal phases were compared. In addition, the derived seasonal phases with field phenological and meteorological data were also compared. It has been found that the success of determining phenological phases from satellite imagery depends on many factors: the spatial resolution of the satellite data, the smoothing method for the time series data, the method for determining phenological parameters, and the field data used for comparison. The results of the study show that phenological phases determined by using MODIS data with a resolution of 250 m best match the phenological data maintained by the Slovenian Forestry Institute using the mean seasonal values method.

AB  - In 1893, a story Apple Trees Are in Bloom by Z.N. Gippius was published in the journal Nashe vremya (Our Time). In 1911, a novel by O. Mirtov (pseudonym of the writer Olga Emmanuilovna Negreskul-Rosenfeld) under the same title Apple Trees Are in Bloom was published in the leading literary , political journal Russkaya Mysl' (Russian Thought), edited by P.B. Struve. A close friend of the Merezhkovsky's family, D.V. Philosophov in his 1914 essay The Feast Trunk pointed out the similarity of titles, reflecting on the secondary nature of literary , philosophical findings of Negreskul. An analysis of the Gippius' story of 1893 and Mirtov's novel of 1911 in the context of philosophical and gender ideas of the turn of the century makes it possible to speak of some literary parallels, both genetic and typological, characteristic of two female authors' work, one of whom wrote under her own name , the other worked under a pseudonym. The commonality of the plot arc of the two works, the similarity of philosophical and aesthetic statements, made in the spirit of modernist artistic quest, the proximity of the Negreskul to the symbolist picture of the world, as evidenced by her first literary experiments, make it possible to identify a common artistic concept of the formation of worldview and artistic motives in the work of two modernist writers.

TI  - Machine-Learned Cloud Classes From Satellite Data for Process-Oriented Climate Model Evaluation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds play a key role in regulating climate change but are difficult to simulate within Earth system models (ESMs). Improving the representation of clouds is one of the key tasks toward more robust climate change projections. This study introduces a new machine-learning-based framework relying on satellite observations to improve understanding of the representation of clouds and their relevant processes in climate models. The proposed method is capable of assigning distributions of established cloud types to coarse data. It facilitates a more objective evaluation of clouds in ESMs and improves the consistency of cloud process analysis. The method is built on satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument labeled by deep neural networks with cloud types defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), using cloud-type labels from CloudSat as ground truth. The method is applicable to datasets with information about physical cloud variables comparable to MODIS satellite data and at sufficiently high temporal resolution. We apply the method to alternative satellite data from the Cloud_cci project (ESA Climate Change Initiative), coarse-grained to typical resolutions of climate models. The resulting cloud-type distributions are physically consistent and the horizontal resolutions typical of ESMs are sufficient to apply our method. We recommend outputting crucial variables required by our method for future ESM data evaluation. This will enable the use of labeled satellite data for a more systematic evaluation of clouds in climate models.

TI  - Downscaling Surface Albedo to Higher Spatial Resolutions With an Image Super-Resolution Approach and PROBA-V Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - For bifacial solar photovoltaic panels, surface albedo plays a crucial role in estimating the radiant energy. Since land surfaces are heterogeneous, the actual albedo of the surface where the solar photovoltaic panel is placed can vary widely and its temporality and sparsity present a significant challenge for renewable energy engineers. This paper develops a new image super-resolution deep learning model based on convolutional neural network to generate high resolution spatial representations of surface albedo from coarse resolution remote sensing-based data. For selected Australian locations, we generated a higher resolution surface albedo using imagery from PROBA-V/SPOT Earth Observation satellites. We proposed a Deep Downscaling Spectral Model with Attention (DDSA) with the capability of processing 10-day albedo images captured ata relatively low (asymptotic to 1 km) resolution. The proposed DDSA was then applied to downscale observed surface albedo and generate predicted albedo at 500 m, 333 m and 250 m resolutions. The proposed model was benchmarked with alternative deep learning, super-resolution approaches: Super-Resolution Convolution Neural Network (SRCNN), Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution network (EDSR), Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network (ESPCN) and Residual Dense Network (RDN). The results showed that the proposed DDSA model outperformed all comparative models in terms of the mean square error (MSE) asymptotic to 0.0041, signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) asymptotic to 39.471, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) asymptotic to 0.999 vs. an MSE asymptotic to [0.0140-0.0387], PSNR asymptotic to [29.761-33.850], SSIM asymptotic to [0.9994-0.999]). We also cross-validated the downscaled images with satellite imagery and ground-based observations, which reaffirmed the proposed DDSA model's ability to produce high resolution surface albedo maps and its potential applications for granular scale tracking and mapping solar energy where bifacial solar photovoltaic panels are placed.

TI  - Japanese New Religious Movement Omoto's Religious-Phenomenological History
T2  - DINBILIMLERI AKADEMIK ARASTIRMA DERGISI-JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN RELIGIOUS SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As the Japanese NRM, in our research on Omoto's religious-phenomenological history, it can be stated that the movement is a characteristic movement that reflects Japanese thought and religious understanding. Omoto, which reflects the expectations, needs, worldview, and religious beliefs of the Japanese agricultural society, which started from the end of the Edo Period and started to modernize with reforms in various fields in the Meiji Period, influenced many religious movements after him in terms of both belief and institutionalization. The characteristic and importance of Omoto revealed by our research is explained by paying attention to the order of the chapters.Religious-phenomenological history of Omoto, the establishment, institutionalization, and rebirth processes of Omoto as a religious movement was examined socio-religiously and sociopolitically. According to this, Omoto existed as a group of Nao affiliated with Konkokyo in the first years and then entered the process of becoming an independent religious movement with the participation of Onisaburo. However, Nao's prophecy that Japan would be defeated in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 did not happen, and most members, including the original members, left the movement. Then, with the support of Onisaburo, the movement started its missionary activities in the country, bought various magazines and newspapers, and actively used them in its activities. With Nao's death, Onisaburo became the sole leader in the movement, gaining more freedom in his actions. Omoto entered the period of institutionalization, organized international aid activities, explained the movement's beliefs and tried to gather supporters. Onisaburo's visit to Mongolia, his return from there, and his experiences as a religious leader paved the way for Omoto to put his expansionist ideas into practice nationally. In this way, many institutions and individuals from the state, the army and civil society have been interested in Omoto. Wanting to take advantage of this situation, Onisaburo established a religious-political association and showed himself in politics. However, the government found their activities harmful, destroyed buildings, and sentenced their leaders and prominent members to life imprisonment. Meanwhile, the Second World War ended, the charges against Omoto were dropped, and the movement pioneered congresses and meetings on post-war peace, religion and language. Thus, Omoto, which gained momentum in the country and around the world, was divided into three groups as a result of the disagreements of the leaders and members with different religious tendencies. This division process that started in 1982 ended in 1992. These groups are not separate official religious movements but are still seen as one religious movement (Omoto). However, each group stated that the other group was an independent religious movement different from them. These groups, called Omoto, Omoto Shinto Rengokai and Aizen'en, are still active.Studies on Japanese NRMs worldwide and in our country are extremely limited and consist of generally accepted determinations and evaluations made by examining limited sources. This prevents both the making of new studies and the introduction of a new perspective on the field. In this context, it can be said that studies carried out on a specific subject by knowing the target language can produce better results. Therefore, our study aims to draw attention to the subject's importance and make a modest contribution by working on the Japanese NRM Omoto. Our study is expected to lead to new research.

TI  - On the Dependence of the ice Formation in the Lake Ladoga on the Air Temperature
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the work was to establish regularities of the ice formation in the largest European Lake Ladoga depending on the air temperature. The average daily air temperatures obtained at the Sortavala weather station for thirty years were used for the analysis. The main task was to determine the sums of accumulated average daily air temperatures necessary for the appearance of primary ice phenomena in areas with different depths of the Lake. To solve this problem digitized remote sensing data of the spatial distribution of ice in the fixed cells with known average depth and data on average daily air temperatures were used. For thirty last winters, the dates of the first ice appearance in each of 180 cells were selected, which were related to the accumulated to this date sum of mean daily air temperatures after its steady transition through 0 & DEG;C towards the negative values. The resulting scheme of the accumulated sums of air temperatures needed for the ice appearance indicates their regular growth with increasing depth. It is assumed that this dependence will make it possible to assess dynamics of ice formation on other lakes.

TI  - A Visualization Framework for Unsupervised Analysis of Latent Structures in SAR Image Time Series
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Openly available satellite image time series (SITS) are considered an important resource for spatiotemporal change monitoring. However, obtaining semantically annotated datasets for such tasks is an expensive affair. To alleviate this problem, this article presents a novel framework to model and understand the image dynamics by discovering latent information in Sentinel-1 SITS, even with limited ground truth data. The framework suggests how to use visualizations to efficiently integrate domain knowledge both for execution and evaluation of the machine-learning pipeline in the absence from ground truth data in SITS change studies. In a case study at a Polar region, we extend a limited amount of ground truth data and then discover its temporal evolution at image patch level, in an unsupervised manner. The trustworthiness of the framework is ensured by integration of domain knowledge and intelligent visual verification strategies. A visualization tool is also implemented for this purpose. The proposed framework contains two modules: a classifier and a change modeler. Our experiments show that a domain-knowledge-based classifier gives the best accuracy. The classifier semantically labeled the complete dataset of 24 study months, containing 153 600 patches with a size of 256 x 256 pixels by extending the available semantic labels from just three months. The temporal sequence of these sematic labels are then recorded and fed to a Bayesian model called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover the underlying patterns. LDA generates a change map containing the dominant dynamic patterns to give a consolidated view of the evolution without having to browse the whole dataset. Further, color-coded change signatures explain the change classes.

TI  - ORTHODOXY AND CONSERVATISM: POLITICAL ATTITUDES OF RELIGIOUS RUSSIANS
T2  - POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY OF POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of the influence of religio-sity on the individual political choice of Orthodox Russians. Based on the ana-lysis of in-depth interviews with believers who actively attend religious services, the author identifies a relationship between certain aspects of religiosity (be-liefs, religious practices) and conservative attitudes of parishioners. The author reveals the logic of a conservative choice and shows how conservative attitudes associated with shifts in values are combined with conservative attitudes based on religion.The results of the study allow the author to document three types of po-litical positioning arising from a conservative worldview. In the case of loyalty to the current government the conservative logic manifests itself in the desire to maintain stability and avoid political changes. Opposition voting takes the form of a moral protest when voters want to punish the authorities for the ac-tions that are inconsistent with their moral ideals. Non-participation in elec-tions is conservative in the sense that believers avoid politics, which seems to them immoral and corrupt.Employing the qualitative methodology and analyzing individual-level data, the author comes to the conclusion that believers make their decisions about voting largely on the basis of their political attitudes. Religious voters evaluate politicians' actions and assess the potential ability to influence the political situation. The impact of practices is limited to political participation. The conservative logic of voting is closely related to secular attitudes; religious beliefs and practices of church cooperation can only adjust the choice that was already made.

M3  - Article
AB  - This text represents comments to the article by T.D. Sokolova "Conceptualization of scientific progress. A Case of Historical Epistemology". Her article combines the concepts of differentiation and integration of scientific knowledge, on the one hand, and the concept of the progress of science interpreted by the historical epistemology of G. Bachelard, on the other, which ultimately is designed to solve the "paradox of interdisciplinarity" and the problem of disciplinary separation of scientific knowledge. The problem posed is highly significant for understanding modern science. At the same time, its formulation can be elaborated and even reformulated, and its premises clarified, since they themselves are the subject of extensive discussions. To do this, it is necessary to revise the widely known definitions of interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity in such a way as to detect the value-worldview content relevant to science as a socio-cultural system that includes the idea of progress.

TI  - THE SPIRIT OF VATICAN II: THE IDEALIST ASPECTS OF LITURGICAL ARCHITECTURE IN EUROPE
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE AND URBANISM
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview of the "idealist" intellectual workshops behind the 20th-century liturgical architecture before and after the Second Vatican Council. These workshops established their concepts on the intriguingly historic presumption that, in order to refresh the Catholic liturgy, one must seek and return to the origins of Christianity. In other words, their worldview was characterized by the spirit of ressourcement, which was one of the great motivators of the new liturgical paradigm brought about by 1962. Ressourcement had both monastic and secular aspects to the invocation - or recreation - of the early apostolic communities by means of new spatial and contextual programs in contemporary church architecture. These programs were conceptually compound, and were often guided or implemented by the clergy itself. The study also sheds light on some of the 21th-century interpretations and the survival of the same ideas in today's architectural culture.

AB  - Social networking services allow users to communicate with their friends and exchange ideas, photos, and videos that delineate their feelings. Sentiments are emotions that express a person's attitude, feelings, and worldview. This raises the possibility of analyzing individual moods and emotions in social network data in order to learn more about people's inclinations and perspectives when communicating online. Sentiment Analysis is the computational study of opinions, assessments, attitudes, subjectivity, and viewpoints represented in text. The emotive appraisal of a condition is a general evaluation of that condition that may be positive or negative depending on physical or mental reactions. In this paper, we attempt to evaluate tweets that contain both text and emoticons in order to determine whether they are positive or negative. This study looked at XGBoost, LinearSVC, Logistic Regression, and BernoulliNB algorithms, with XGBoost providing the highest accuracy of 87.841%. The paper's key contribution is the use of the XGBoost model for tweets that include emoticons, which also produced the greatest accuracy.

AB  - Remote sensing has been evolving as a general method for multi-scale crop information extraction. Large scale multi-crop discrimination using airborne, or satellite remote sensing is required for farm level intervention and for decision making by various stake holders such as agriculture insurance companies, risk assessment agencies and local governments. Multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data from various platforms have been used for discriminating and mapping various crops. However, the number of crops, and the scale at which the discrimination is often limited to a few crops and is often approached as discrimination against other land cover classes. Further, multi-temporal datasets and spectral indices form the bulk of the datasets for crops discrimination. For potential operational application at field level, the ability to discriminate numerous crops - at least ten different crops at the same timeframe are vital. Furthermore, discrimination of crops grown under organic practices has promising application in the certification and quality assurance of agricultural produced sold as organic product. Theoretically, high resolution hyperspectral data has the capability to difference few tens of classes unambiguously. However, given the context of systematic spectral similarity in vegetation, especially crops, the potential of discrimination several crops are unclear. We, therefore, has assessed the spectral discrimination of as many as 23 different vegetable crops and attempted discriminating a few vegetable crops grown under organic and inorganic crop growing practices. For this, we have applied 12 different statistical and machine learning algorithms establishing the spectral discrimination and assessing its relative stand across the range of crops considered. The results indicate complex patterns of spectral discrimination wherein a few crops exhibit spectral similarity with several other crops at any scale of spectral characterization. The discrimination analysis of vegetable crops grown under organic and chemical input-based practices indicate a good discrimination. However, the quality of discrimination is substantially affected by the type of machine learning model used. We recommend coordinated multi-site and multi-phenology- based crop discrimination for establishing the stability of the discrimination observed across space and time.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The purpose of the study was to determine the correlation between biological subtype of breast cancer and the risk of its metastasis to a sentinel lymph node.Material and methods: In the analysed group there were 1018 women with breast cancer, clinically node negative, untreated previously. Luminal A subtype was recognised in 57% of patients. A positive sentinel lymph node was detected in 26.5% of women.Results: In the multivariate analysis only age and tumour size proved to be significant for the entire group, respectively: OR = 0.59, p = 0.0004; OR = 1.96; p < 0.0001. For Luminal A subtype values were OR = 0.51, p = 0.0007; OR = 1.78, p = 0.0045, respectively. For Luminal B patients, in women over 61 years, the risk of sentinel node metastasis probability decreases by 67% and for tumours over 21 mm the probability of positive sentinel node metastasis increases by 117%. Conclusions: According to our analysis luminal breast cancers are most numerous subtypes, and in these cases we expect more frequent instances of metastasis to a sentinel node. Following the most updated and modern procedures of breast cancer patients' treatment a procedure of sentinel lymph node biopsy is used, replacing an aggressive treatment in the axilla region. In regards to our analysis we should be more vigilant in estimation of regional lymph nodes in luminal patients under sixty with high grade tumours and the tumour diameter more than 20 mm.

TI  - Etiologies of influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections in Tanzania, 2017-2019.
T2  - PLOS global public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In 2016, Tanzania expanded sentinel surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) to include testing for non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRVs) and additional respiratory pathogens at 9 sentinel sites. During 2017-2019, respiratory specimens from 2730 cases underwent expanded testing: 2475 specimens (90.7%) were tested using a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-developed assay covering 7 NIRVs (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], rhinovirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, and 3) and influenza A and B viruses. Additionally, 255 specimens (9.3%) were tested using the Fast-Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 33 (FTD-33) kit which covered the mentioned viruses and additional viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. Influenza viruses were identified in 7.5% of all specimens; however, use of the CDC assay and FTD-33 kit increased the number of specimens with a pathogen identified to 61.8% and 91.5%, respectively. Among the 9 common viruses between the CDC assay and FTD-33 kit, the most identified pathogens were RSV (22.9%), rhinovirus (21.8%), and adenovirus (14.0%); multi-pathogen co-detections were common. Odds of hospitalization (SARI vs. ILI) varied by sex, age, geographic zone, year of diagnosis, and pathogen identified; hospitalized illnesses were most common among children under the age of 5 years. The greatest number of specimens were submitted for testing during December-April, coinciding with rainy seasons in Tanzania, and several viral pathogens demonstrated seasonal variation (RSV, human metapneumovirus, influenza A and B, and parainfluenza viruses). This study demonstrates that expanding an existing influenza platform to include additional respiratory pathogens can provide valuable insight into the etiology, incidence, severity, and geographic/temporal patterns of respiratory illness. Continued respiratory surveillance in Tanzania, and globally, can provide valuable data, particularly in the context of emerging respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, and guide public health interventions to reduce the burden of respiratory illnesses.

TI  - The effects of environmental value and ecological worldview on eco-recreative attitude: an application in Turkey
T2  - TOURISM & MANAGEMENT STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate the effects of environmental value and ecological worldview on eco-recreative attitudes. In recent years, human-related pollution has seriously increased. Therefore, it is critical to explain the eco-recreative attitudes of participants with an emphasis on how these attitudes support natural life. Another indicator of the significance of this study is that it explains the premises of the attitude. Environmental value in the proposed model was examined as three sub-factors: biospheric, altruistic, and egoistic. Also, an eco-recreative attitude has three sub-factors, which are affective, cognitive and behavioural. The study population consisted of individuals who participated in eco-recreation activities in Turkey. The data were collected through a questionnaire form using the convenience sampling method. The analyses were conducted using SmartPLS. The findings showed that biospheric (positive) and egoistic value (negative) had an effect on ecological worldview, while ecological worldview had a positive effect on affective, cognitive and behavioural attitude. Also, the altruistic value did not significantly affect the ecological worldview.

TI  - Earthquake affects subsidence in Jakarta using Sentinel-1A time series images and 2D-MSBAS method
T2  - VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Excessive groundwater extraction has been well known as the main factor causing land subsidence in several cities in Jakarta Basin, Indonesia. This area is surrounded by active geological structures and has thick sediments. This study emphasizes the impacts of earthquakes on subsidence over Jakarta and its surroundings by using the Sentinel-1A images and 2D-MSBAS (Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset) method. Sixty-one ascending and 66 descending Sentinel-1A images were utilized to derive 121 deformation maps from 26 March 2017 to 2 July 2019 by using the 2D-MSBAS method. Linear and nonlinear displacement variations were analyzed to understand earthquake impacts on the subsidence and their seasonal characteristics. On 23 January 2018, the Mw 5.9 earthquake shaking off the coast of Java significantly affected ground surface subsidence in Jakarta. A cumulative magnitude and linear rate increase of the subsidence reached approximately-196 mm and-44 mm/yr, respectively, during the period of this study. Besides the subsidence rate changes, the earthquake also affected the expansion of the localized subsiding areas at several sites. The earthquake-activated fault affected the ground surface of the surrounding area, moving east and subsiding in the western part of the study area. Meanwhile, variations of the nonlinear subsidence to the seasonal precipitation depended on the aquifer system behavior to retain an elastic expansion and land cover types in the investigated regions.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF MT-INSAR PROCESSING TECHNIQUES FOR SLOW-MOVING LANDSLIDES MONITORING IN CUENCA (ECUADOR) THROUGH DOUBLE-BAND SAR SATELLITE
T2  - ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are among the most intense geological disasters worldwide. Several remote sensing techniques have been used to study these phenomena over the last few decades, including Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radars (MT-InSAR), in particular, Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) and Permanent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI). The University of Azuay and highway infrastructure (Cuenca -Ecuador) were affected by slow-moving landslides which in urban areas had more noticeable deformation effects due to their crowns. Furthermore, evidence indicates that the landslide toe was developed in a rural area. To study landslide boundary and deformation kinematics comprehensively, we need to observe two distinct scattering surfaces using SAR imagery (high coherence areas in the urban area and low coherence areas in the rural area). We can also observe different distributions in X-and C-bands due to the rural area covered by vegetation and trees at the toe of the landslide. Two sets of radar images were analyzed and compared for monitoring the aforementioned slow-moving landslide kinematics, including Sentinel1-A (S1 -A) and COSMO-SkyMed (CSK). PSI and SBAS techniques have been used to measure the rate of surface deformation and displacement time series at CSK over the period (2017-2019) and S1-A units over the period (2015-2018), respectively. Furthermore, a GNSS station in the stable area was used as a reference station to integrate the PSI and SBAS results over space. Then, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (K-medians) was used to determine the most appropriate intervals for preparing mean deformation rate maps. Finally, a comparison was made between the outputs obtained from this study and displacement recorded at two additional GNSS stations located in the area affected by deformation. As a result, by comparing and monitoring double-band SAR satellites and different SAR image processing techniques, it became possible to analyze the whole landslide of our case study appropriately.

TI  - Python Driven Pathways for Wheat Cultivation Incorporating Physico-Climatic Parameters of Growth
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture has a pivotal role in the provision of food, fabric and income. Agricultural sector is backbone of Pakistan's economy, which is strongly dependent on agriculture. Pakistan is renowned globally for its wheat crop. However, wheat production has suffered due to lack of modern farming techniques, inadequate water availability, and relevant soil parameters. The main objective of this study was to monitor stages of wheat growth using Landsat 8 thermal datasets through temperature-based site maps. This study delineates suitable areas for sustainable wheat growth using Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) and GIS. The total area under investigation was 5,697 km(2) and the area under wheat cultivation was 2,276.63 km(2), out of which 1,684.26 km(2) (74%) was found highly suitable, 68.3376 km2 (3%) was moderately suitable, 61.6678 km(2) (2.7%) was least suitable, and 462.355 km2 (20.30%) was found not suitable for wheat crop cultivation. The results interoperated that the area with temperature range of 10-18C, and pH ranging between 6.2 and 6.5, clay loom soil texture, and 0.85 and 1.1 drainage level indicate highly suitable land for wheat production. This study highlights the local farming techniques, suitable land for wheat production, and patterns of crop harvesting.

TI  - Understanding Volume Estimation Uncertainty of Lakes and Wetlands Using Satellites and Citizen Science
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied variations in the volume of water stored in small lakes and wetlands using satellite remote sensing and lake water height data contributed by citizen scientists. A total of 94 water bodies across the globe were studied using satellite data in the optical and microwave wavelengths from Landsat 8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. The uncertainty in volume estimation as a function of geography and geophysical factors, such as cloud cover, precipitation, and water surface temperature, was studied. The key finding that emerged from this global study is that uncertainty is highest in regions with a distinct precipitation season, such as in the monsoon dominated South Asia or the Pacific Northwestern region of the USA. This uncertainty is further compounded when small lakes and wetlands are seasonal with alternating land use as a water body and agricultural land, such as the wetlands of Northeastern Bangladesh. On an average, 45% of studied lakes could be estimated of their volume change with a statistical significant uncertainty that is less than the expected volume in South Asia. In North America, this statistically significant uncertainty in volume estimation was found to be around 50% in lakes eastward of the 108th meridian with lowest uncertainty found in lakes along the East coast of the USA. The article provides a baseline for understanding the current state of the art in estimating volumetric change of lakes and wetlands using citizen science in anticipation of the recently launched Surface Water and Ocean Topography Mission.

TI  - GENRE OF GOOD WISH (YORAL) IN KALMYK POETRY OF THE 20TH -BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY: ZUL HOLIDAY
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the Kalmyk folk wishes, calendar ritual wishes occupy a certain place associated with the way of life of nomads, their worldview, beliefs, culture, habitat, and way of life. The most famous yoryals-good wishes are: the meeting of winter / New Year (Zul), the meeting of spring - Tsahan Sar (White Moon), less often - the meeting of summer Yrs Sar (Uryus Sar). In a number of folklore collections of different years, such texts were published in the original, sometimes with a parallel Russian translation. Previously, yoryals were part of the ritual of a particular holiday, over time they began to be performed independently. Along with these ancient well-wishes, new samples of calendar yoryals, presented in collections and books, continue to be created. The revival of Buddhism in Kalmykia at the end of the last century led to the active functioning of both the indicated folklore genres and the restoration of the customs and rituals of these holidays to one degree or another, including at the republican level. The atheistic policy of the Soviet state influenced the author's genres of wishes on such a ritual theme in the Kalmyk poetry of the last century. Few samples appeared in the 1980s 1990s, mainly addressed to two holidays - Zul and Tsagaan Sar. This trend is also characteristic of the beginning of the new century, despite the lifting of bans and the return of cultural heritage. The genre of calendar wishes was usually addressed by poets of the older generation both in the past and in the present. Their texts, on the one hand, in form and content are close to the folklore tradition, but, on the other hand, in a transformed way show the plot plan, personal discourse, stylistic originality. There are traditional Zul markers: veneration of fire, sun, family, ancestor worship, gods, nature, prayer, and the addition of age.

TI  - GENRE OF GOOD WISH (YORAL) IN KALMYK POETRY OF THE 20TH-BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY: WHITE MONTH (TSAGAN SAR). PART 1
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Representative poems by Kalmyk poets in the native and Russian languages, addressed to the calendar holiday of the meeting of spring - Tsagan Sar, were created in the second half of the last century, when the revival of national rituals and customs began, the celebration of Zul and Tsagan Sar. The appeal to folklore analogues - good wishes in honor of these calendar holidays - contributed to the emergence of the genre of good wishes in Kalmyk poetry about the meetings of winter, spring and summer, first as creative adaptations of folk samples (S. Kalyaev and others), then as authorial ones. Legends about the appearance of the Tsagaan Sar holiday are stated in the verses of L. Indzhiev and R. Khaninova. Most of the poems of Kalmyk poets of different generations convey the continuity of the folklore tradition in the very titles "Tsakhan Sar" ("White Moon"): a description of the departure of winter and the onset of spring, a greeting ritual, the exchange of gifts, going to visit, tea drinking with bortsyks, good wishes to live without wars and troubles, in peace and harmony, in prosperity and joy, in friendship and love, with the addition of a family and the offspring of livestock. The monologic form, sometimes including elements of a dialogue-greeting, is replete with rhetorical figures, comparisons, epithets, metaphors, personification, appeals to deities (Okon-Tengri, Tsagaan Ezn, etc.), reproduction of the initial Buddhist prayer, formulary. The gender aspect in the well-wishing of the White Moon is manifested in the description of the process of making tea and bortsyks by B. Sangadzhieva. In a broad sense, the yoryals on Tsagaan Sar have something in common with other yoryals as a projection of the worldview of nomads living in close relationship with the surrounding nature and neighboring peoples. The traditional poetic form of the yoryals was reflected in the verses of Kalmyk poets, both short and lengthy.

AB  - Every place be it a household or organization, big or small, like banks have something that needs to be secured to ensure efficient operations and management. Security is always a concern as what is being protected is valuable. Security systems based on singular or multiple biometrics such as face, voice, iris, fingerprint and palm along with things being carried in person such as RFID card or security key(s) are used along with or instead of pin, password based existing lock systems is mostly used because of the uniqueness and added layer of security provided by the aforementioned features. But the implementation of these features alone is not sufficient to thwart any malicious actions to gain access to a secure location, due to rise in technology capable of beating/bypassing said security systems. Thus, this paper proposes a robust security system that will be take care of security requirements of any location that might contain something valuable and to be retrofitted with the problems prevailing in the present systems. The proposed system is capable of detecting & recognizing a person's face, their emotion based on facial expression, the liveliness factor of their face to determine physical presence, identifying the speaker along with a word/phrase in their speech and detecting factors in the surrounding environment that may threaten a user. The system is designed in away such that anyone whowants to enter/access a secure location has to pass through all of these layers like password, facial recognition, facial emotion recognition, facial liveliness recognition, speaker recognition, speaker phrase detection, and environmental threat detection etc. of security-working in unison, none of which can be bypassed easily. All the sensors for detecting, identifying and recognizing said biometric features are securely connected to a singular security device to ensure success of this goal.

TI  - Self-Assessment and Indirect Assessment of Stress and Stressful Situation by Children Aged 8-12
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY-JOURNAL OF THE HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to identi-fy the match value between self -assess-ment and indirect assessment of stress by children of primary school age. The par-ticipants of the study were 132 junior schoolchildren aged 8-12 years, study-ing in grades 3-4 in a school in the Moscow Region. Indirect evaluation was measured with the projective Etkind's Color Test of Relationships; two indica-tors were chosen: the first one was the child's assignment of a stressful situation as "pleasant" (high significance) or less pleasant (low significance); the second indicator was the child's assessment of stress as a positive or negative phenome-non. Self-assessment of stress was meas-ured with the Perceived Stress Scale for Children, PSS-C. It was shown that at the age of 8-12 years, children are able toassess stress differently: negatively - as a distress, and positively - as an eustress. Depending on the degree of rel-evance of the stressful situation for the child and its negative indirect assess-ment, indicators of self-assessment of stress change. In children who perceived stress as a relevant situation and indi-rectly assessed it negatively, self -assess-ment of stress was high; if the stressful situation was indirectly assessed as posi-tive, the self-assessment of stress was low. At the same time, positive assess-ment of stress can also be an indicator of a successful coping with it or attest to the psychological defenses that prevent the child from overcoming feelings of anxiety and stress.

TI  - Pollution and Climatic Influence on Trees in the Siberian Arctic Wetlands
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Siberian Arctic wetlands located within the planetary "warming hotspot" experience pronounced climate-driven vegetation cover changes. Together with warming, wetlands, which are located within the influence of Norilsk copper and nickel industry (69.35 degrees N, 88.12 degrees E), have been strongly influenced by industrial pollutions (sulfur dioxide mostly) since the 1940s. In addition, petroleum products release occurred in 2020 that potentially influenced vegetation vigor. We studied the combined effect of climate warming and pollution on the larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) and shrubs' (Salix spp. and alder, Duschekia fruticosa) growth. Using satellite data (MODIS and Sentinel) processing, we mapped wetlands within the study area. We used on-ground survey, and applied dendrochronology, climate variables, and emissions rate analysis. We sampled woods (kerns) and, based on the tree ring analysis, generated trees and shrubs growth index (GI) chronologies. We analyzed the influence of the SO2 emissions and eco-climate variables (air temperatures, precipitation, soil moisture, and drought index SPEI) on the larch and shrubs GI. We mapped GPP and NPP (gross and net primary productivity) and vegetation index NDVI and temporal trends of these indexes based on the MODIS-derived products. We found that chronic SO2 influence led to larch trees GI decrease that was followed by tree mortality, which was observed until the end of 1990. Since the beginning of the 2000s, the GI of larch and shrubs has increased, which is correlated with elevated air and soil temperature and growth season prolongation, whereas excessive soil moisture negatively influenced GI. Together with that, increasing trends of vegetation indexes (GPP, NPP, and NDVI) were observed on the part of wetland within the zone of former trees' heavy damage and mortality. The trends began mostly in 2003-2005 and were caused by emissions volume decrease and warming, together with resistant species' (willows, graminoids, bushes, and birch) growth and invasion. We suggested that increasing productivity trends might partly be attributed to nitrogen fertilization caused by NOx emissions. Finally, we found that diesel fuel spill which happened in 2020 caused no influence on the larch, whereas some aquatic species (mosses mostly) were damaged.

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study was to identify psycholinguistic models of the explication of salutary values of Ukrainians of different ages (from 18 to 65+) during the large-scale aggression of Russia against Ukraine in the specified period. Research methodology. The survey was conducted in two stages using the questionnaire "Welcoming Values of Ukrainians": in the first stage, 28 or 100% of people aged 18 to 55 took part in the survey, in the second stage 51 or 100% of respondents aged 18 to 69 years old. 89 respondents (in two stages of the survey) were asked to answer 2 questions and complete 2 tasks; question 1 - "What were your life values BEFORE February 24, 2022? Describe", question 2 - "What are your life values now AFTER exposure to mediatization? Describe". According to the results of processing the received data, it was established that the subjects have different psycholinguistic models of explication of the vital values of Ukrainians during the large-scale aggression of Russia against Ukraine. Conclusions. Indeed, nine (at the first stage) and eight (at the second stage) different psycholinguistic models function in the worldview of Ukrainian respondents of different ages, which were explained by eight (at the first stage) and thirteen (at the second stage) verbal markers.

TI  - SCIENTIST AND TEACHER-TWO FACETS OF BEING A LECTURER OF HIGH SCHOOL IN A POSTMODERN WORLD
T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the problem of the dualistic unity of the values of being a teacher who is both a research scientist and an educator. The specifics of the professional combination of scientific research and practice of live teach-ing are considered.The paper comprehends the extraordinary phenomenon of education in the context of the scientific and ideological para-digm of understanding, which is a professional basis for both teaching and research activities. Education is represented as a person's spiritual face, which is formed under the influence of moral and spiritual values, which is the property of its cultural circle. The examples of stereotyped education are proposed, which leads to the idea that an indicator of human educated-ness is undoubtedly the worldview and methodological layer of acquired philosophical knowledge, which embodies the spiritual world.The reality and illusory nature of the fact of the "research point" in the activity of the scientist are reflected and the re-flection of the determinants of the problem of "different per-sonalities of scientists" is offered. The issue of teaching au-thors is singled out as a discourse of style, manners, creativi-ty, content, interpretations, etc.

AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) leads to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Nowadays, PM2.5 monitoring on a large scale is a significant concern. The study aims to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations and assess the effect of open-pit mining and urbanization on PM2.5 concentrations by using satellite observations and ground-based stations over Binh Duong province, Vietnam. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and hourly data of PM2.5 concentrations, temperature, and relative humidity at ground-based stations in 2020 (May-December) are matched to establish the relationship between AOD and PM2.5. Linear regression and multiple linear regression methods show a good correlation with R = 0.806 and R = 0.817, respectively. The study applies both regression models to estimate the spatial distribution of monthly PM2.5 concentrations over Binh Duong province and validate with ground-based stations data (R = 0.878; RMSE = 6.62 mu g/m(3)). The results show that the annual PM2.5 concentrations are high in the southern districts where it is densely populated and tend to decrease in the northern districts of which the highest are found in Di An (18.76 mu g/m(3)) and Thuan An (18.76 mu g/m(3)), the lowest is in Phu Giao (14.20 mu g/m(3)). The study demonstrates that the development of urban built-up density and population density increases the contribution of fine particles. At the same time, open-pit mine areas are the main contribution of coarse particles.

TI  - 60-Year Research History and Future Prospects in Environment Field in Korean Meteorological Society
T2  - ATMOSPHERE-KOREA
M3  - Review
AB  - Research papers in the field of atmospheric environment published in three Journals: Journal of Korean Meteorological Society, Atmosphere, and Asia-Pacific Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, are all summarized over period of 60 years since the establishment of Korea Meteorological Society (KMS) in 1963. In addition, current research trends and future outlook in the atmospheric environment field has been also highlighted. The results of historical records published in three KMS journals indicated that the activities, contents, and scope of researches carried out by KMS members in the field of atmospheric environment have yielded the enormous and rapid progress in each of the all four areas over 60 years. In particular, as the chronological progress of observational instruments and availability of satellite data such as from GEMS can be a great asset to deepen the observational and modeling researches in the current and future studies, it is highly anticipated that the more progressive and in-depth studies can be achievable to abate the air pollutants over the Korea as well as northeast Asia.

TI  - InSAR Time Series Analysis to Evaluate Subsidence Risk of Monumental Chandigarh City (India) and Surroundings
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater depletion is one of the serious geoenvironmental issues causing ground subsidence, which damages buildings, infrastructures, and causes loss of life. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of groundwater variability requires multiple approaches to measure hydraulic head level and geodetic deformation. In this study, we have made efforts to integrate multiple hierarchical space-borne data, including Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), and geological and hydrological data, to quantify subsidence in Chandigarh city and its surroundings. First, we conducted New-Small BAseline Subsets (NSBASs) and pointwise persistent scatterer (PS) InSAR techniques in parallel, using three-year Sentinel-1 data showing a vertical subsidence up to 120 mm/year around fluvial sediment deposits. Furthermore, correlation analysis of hydraulic/climatic measurements clearly shows the subsidence associated with the groundwater depletion. The pattern of PS points shows the instability of structures associated with the ground subsidence over the central city areas. The monumental architectures designed by Le Corbusier in the northern sectors are outside of the main subsidence area. In the target area, the magnitude of subsidence and surface deformation due to groundwater depletion depends on the subsurface geophysical environment and the anthropogenic activities within the region and surroundings. The results provided a case of monitoring scheme using multiresolution satellite data about the subsidence and associated consequences due to groundwater depletion.

TI  - ADOM: ADMM-Based Optimization Model for Stripe Noise Removal in Remote Sensing Image
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images (RSI) are useful for various tasks such as Earth observation and climate change. However, RSI may suffer from stripe noise due to physical limitations in sensor systems. Therefore, image destriping is essential, since stripe noise may cause serious problems in real applications. In this paper, we shall present a new Alternating Direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based Optimization Model, called ADOM for stripe noise removal in RSI. First, we formulate an optimization function for finding stripe noise components from the observed image for stripe noise removal, and then optimization process for solving the optimization function in order to extract stripe noise component. In the optimization process, we shall propose a weight-based detection strategy for efficient stripe noise component capture, and an ADMM-based acceleration strategy for fast stripe noise removal. In the weight-based detection strategy, we effectively detect stripe noise similar to the image details by using weighted norm generated by adjusting norm and group norm weights based on the momentum coefficient and residual parameter. In the ADMM-based acceleration strategy, we accelerate optimization process by using two control strategies: evidence-based starting point control and momentum-based step-size control. The former provides a starting point for more accurately finding stripe noise component, and the latter accelerates convergence by using the momentum coefficient while providing optimization stability by exploiting the damping coefficient. Our experimental results show that ADOM achieves better performance for both of simulated and real image data sets compared to the other destriping models.

AB  - In Europe, coal energy has recently been limited due to environmental pollution. However, other sources still do not provide enough energy for European countries. Additionally, the limitation in coal exploitation has resulted in reducing labor market in mining workers. Therefore, despite having to pay a fine every day, coal mines are still operated in Poland. Pniowek is a fifty-year coal mine in the south of Poland with over 1000 m depth. It is one of the largest coal reserves in Poland, with a total operative resource 101.9 million tons. This mine provides about 12,200 tons of coal every day. This paper uses 44 images Sentinel-1A satellite data from June 19th 2018 to December 23rd 2019 with InSAR technology to determine subsidence and ongoing deformation on and around this mine. The study results are useful for policymakers, managers, and authorities with a better management system. This is because land subsidence is happening and destroying infrastructure, and threatening people live in the area. The results, which are processed by the Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR) method with the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers software packages (StaMPS), show that the subsidence has occurred in most of the areas. The maximum line-of-sight (LOS) displacement of up to -40 mm/yr is found in the residential area near the mine in Pawlowice village, while the LOS displacement within the Pniowek mine reaches - 36.7 mm/yr.

AB  - Immediate lymphatic reconstruction (ILR) at the time of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has become increasingly utilized for the prevention of breast cancer related lymphedema. Preoperative indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography is routinely performed prior to an ILR procedure to characterize baseline lymphatic anatomy of the upper extremity. While most patients have linear lymphatic channels visualized on ICG, representing a non-diseased state, some patients demonstrate non-linear patterns. This study aims to determine potential inciting factors that help explain why some patients have non-linear patterns, and what these patterns represent regarding the relative risk of developing postoperative breast cancer related lymphedema in this population. A retrospective review was conducted to identify breast cancer patients who underwent successful ILR with preoperative ICG at our institution from November 2017-June 2022. Among the 248 patients who were identified, 13 (5%) had preoperative non-linear lymphatic anatomy. A history of trauma or surgery of the affected limb and an increasing number of sentinel lymph nodes removed prior to ALND appeared to be risk factors for non-linear lymphatic anatomy. Furthermore, non-linear anatomy in the limb of interest was associated with an increased risk of postoperative lymphedema development. Overall, non-linear lymphatic anatomy on pre-operative ICG lymphography appears to be a risk factor for developing ipsilateral breast cancer-related lymphedema. Guided by the study's findings, when breast cancer patients present with baseline non-linear lymphatic anatomy, our institution has implemented a protocol of prophylactically prescribing compression sleeves immediately following ALND.

TI  - Extracellular Vesicles Are Important Mediators That Regulate Tumor Lymph Node Metastasis via the Immune System
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are particles with a lipid bilayer structure, and they are secreted by various cells in the body. EVs interact with and modulate the biological functions of recipient cells by transporting their cargoes, such as nucleic acids and proteins. EVs influence various biological phenomena, including disease progression. They also participate in tumor progression by stimulating a variety of signaling pathways and regulating immune system activation. EVs induce immune tolerance by suppressing CD8(+) T-cell activation or polarizing macrophages toward the M2 phenotype, which results in tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. Moreover, immune checkpoint molecules are also expressed on the surface of EVs that are secreted by tumors that express these molecules, allowing tumor cells to not only evade immune cell attack but also acquire resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. During tumor metastasis, EVs contribute to microenvironmental changes in distant organs before metastatic lesions appear; thus, EVs establish a premetastatic niche. In particular, lymph nodes are adjacent organs that are connected to tumor lesions via lymph vessels, so that tumor cells metastasize to draining lymph nodes at first, such as sentinel lymph nodes. When EVs influence the microenvironment of lymph nodes, which are secondary lymphoid tissues, the immune response against tumor cells is weakened; subsequently, tumor cells spread throughout the body. In this review, we will discuss the association between EVs and tumor progression via the immune system as well as the clinical application of EVs as biomarkers and therapeutic agents.

AB  - The village of Ruidoso is a small community nestled in the mountains of Lincoln County, New Mexico, with an estimated 326 mi of water distribution lines. In FY 2020, the village produced approximately 622 MG for the year, of which only 316 MG was authorized consumption from the village's operations and 7,525 active connections. With approximately 52.1% of water being classified as non-revenue, it was evident that there were a substantial number of undetected leaks within the system. Because of this, the village solicited proposals for leak detection services. In December 2021, Wachs Water Services entered a contract with the village of Ruidoso to conduct a system-wide leak detection survey with the primary goals of locating distribution system leaks using conventional leak detection methods and collecting the global position system (GPS) coordinates of each asset. This white paper and subsequent presentation will reveal the many challenges faced by Wachs crews, including undocumented water mains and valves discovered while surveying the system. Furthermore, this paper will reveal the savings to the villager and return on investment for the first year of its 10-year leak detection program.

TI  - Alexander Bogdanov's system methodology from the perspective of the modern economic worldview
T2  - VOPROSY EKONOMIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The doctrine of Alexander Bogdanov, the forerunner of the comprehensive system analysis developed later, is considered in the article from the point of view of the typology of the basic factors of the systemic development of the economy. The paradigm of space-time as an environment for the functioning of the economy in Bogdanov's interpretation is analyzed in connection with the well-known concepts of space and time in physics, which allows us to take a fresh look at the relationship and roles of macro-, meso-, micro- and nanolevels in the economy. The representation of human economic activity as a combination of the processes of cognition and creation of spiritual and material values makes it possible to expand the concept of the connectedness of economic phenomena through causal (successive) and induction (mirror) dependencies. From this perspective, the reasons for the dominance of short-range and long-range effects, short- and long-term effects in different periods of the development of the Russian economy are considered.

TI  - FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Freedom of conscience is currently understood as the right to profess any (not only religious) worldview, as a freedom of views, assessments and beliefs, which is associated with the loss of religiosity in developed civilizations. There is a possibility for abusing this right, which is expressed in the implementation of religious, extremist and terrorist activities related to the worldview; inducement to suicide; damage to the morality and health of citizens; the use of narcotic and psychotropic drugs, hypnosis; the commission of depraved and other illegal actions. The most dangerous are those teachings that clearly claim to replace the << old >> religions with the new ones. Currently, they are promoted by pseudo-religious organizations of a destructive nature, which are also called totalitarian sects. The exponential growth of such organizations is characteristic during periods of social upheaval and turmoil. On the one hand, their multiplication is a kind of symptom of a serious disease of the state organism. On the other hand, this organism becomes an object of social influence by external forces and new religious teachings are often nothing more than the embodiment of these social projects. In this regard, it is important to highlight the main feature of destructive pseudo-religious organizations - they threaten national security in the near or long term. In terms of immediate goals, the use of pseudo-religious organizations as agents of Western intelligence community should be pointed out. From the long-term perspective, the goal is the indoctrination of a considerable number of Russian citizens with a zombie consciousness ranging from active adherents of pseudo-religious ideas to obedient executors of someone else's will. The authors use empirical research to analyze the destructive organizations most known to the citizens of Russia, and to show the dynamics of their development: from pseudo religious to extremist and further to terrorist. This is especially clearly seen in the example of the totalitarian sect << White Brotherhood >>, whose experience was later used for the nazification of Ukraine.

T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyses changes in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) val-ues in the eastern Baltic region. The main aim of the work is to evaluate changes in growing season indicators (onset, end time, time of maximum greenness and duration) and their re-lationship with meteorological conditions (air temperature and precipitation) in 1982-2015. NDVI seasonality and long-term trends were analysed for different types of land use: arable land, pastures, wetlands, mixed and coniferous forests. In the southwestern part of the study area, the growing season lasts longest, while in the northeast, the growing season is shorter on average by 10 weeks than in the other parts of the analysed territory. The air temperature in February and March is the most important factor determining the start of the growing season and the air temperature in September and October determines the end date of the growing season. Precipitation has a much smaller effect, especially at the beginning of the growing season. The effect of meteorological conditions on peak greenness is weak and, in most cases, statistically insignificant. At the end of the analysed period (1982-2015), the growing season started earlier and ended later (in both cases the changes were 3-4 weeks) than at the be-ginning of the study period. All these changes are statistically significant. The duration of the growing season increased by 6-7 weeks.(c) 2022 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Leo Tolstoy's Christian anarchism: Towards a political theology
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA I KONFLIKTOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article specifies the characteristics of Christian Anarchism as applied to the religious teaching of Lev Tolstoy. An attempt is made to overcome the political stereotype of his per -ception as an anarchist, but to consider it's in the context of Political Theology. The article calls into question the legitimacy of considering his religious teachings in the unambiguous political discourse of Anarchism. If the concept of Christian Anarchism is a special kind of theoretical and ideological oxymoron of "religious politics", then Tolstoy's teaching is consid-ered as a manifestation of his subjectivism, aimed at simultaneously overcoming the personal, animal element in man and reaching an impersonal universal spiritual principle, without any external restrictions. Freedom, as the most important category of his worldview, is presented rather in the form of religious monarchism - submission to the Divine will and life accord-ing to Christ, and not in the form of radical Anarchism. Political Theology is considered as a conscious non-participation of individual in politics - that is, refusal to stay in state struc-tures such as courts, army, police, etc., - is the religious-subjective, peaceful destruction of the system, according to Tolstoy. On this path, he went much further than his Enlightenment teachers with their theories of social contracts, creating a model of not struggle, not reconcili-ation, not an agreement, but retirement from the state in the form of non-participation in its violence and atrocities. But all this is worth doing - not rebelling anarchically, not for the sake of oneself or social justice, but completely obeying the Divine will, which is a religious modification of the Kantian ethical imperative in Tolstoy's teachings. Chertkov has named this as model of theocratic monarchism.

TI  - Evaluation of Partitioned Evaporation and Transpiration Estimates within the DisALEXI Modeling Framework over Irrigated Crops in California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate characterization of evapotranspiration (ET) is imperative in water-limited cropping systems such as California vineyards and almond orchards. Satellite-based ET modeling techniques, including the atmosphere-land exchange inverse model (ALEXI) and associated flux disaggregation technique (DisALEXI), have proven reliable in determining field scale ET. However, validation efforts typically focus on ET and omit an evaluation of partitioned evaporation (E) and transpiration (T). ALEXI/DisALEXI is based on the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model, making it uniquely qualified to derive E and T individually. The current study evaluated E and T estimates derived using two formulations of DisALEXI; one based on Priestley-Taylor (DisALEXI-PT) and the other on Penman-Monteith (DisALEXI-PM). The modeled values were validated against partitioned fluxes derived from the conditional eddy covariance (CEC) approach using EC flux towers in three wine grape vineyards and three almond orchards for the year 2021. Modeled estimates were derived using Landsat 8 Collection 2 thermal infrared and surface reflectance imagery as well as Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance datasets as input into DisALEXI. The results indicated that the modeled total ET fluxes were similar between the two methods, but the partitioned values diverged, with DisALEXI-PT overestimating E and slightly underestimating T when compared to CEC estimates. Conversely, DisALEXI-PM agreed better with CEC-derived E and overestimated T estimates under non-advective conditions. Compared to one another, DisALEXI-PM estimated canopy temperatures similar to 5 degrees C cooler and soil temperatures similar to 5 degrees C warmer than DisALEXI-PT, causing differences in E and T of -2.6 mm day(-1) and +2.6 mm day(-1), respectively. The evaluation of the iterative process required for DisALEXI indicates DisALEXI-PM ET values converge on ALEXI ET with proportionate adjustments to E and T, while DisALEXI-PT convergence is driven by adjustments to E. The analysis presented here can potentially drive improvements in the modeling framework to provide specific soil and canopy consumptive water use information in unique canopy structures, allowing for improved irrigation and water use efficiencies in these water-limited systems.

TI  - Pir Sultan as an Artist Rebelling Against Absurd
T2  - MILLI FOLKLOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Rebellion is a behavior that has been known since the existence of man and is seen as a part of his na-ture. The behavior of rebellion is one of the first reactions of man against a ban in mythical narratives and holy books. Accordingly, in the traditional worldview, disobedience has always been considered an immoral behavior, and obedience has been seen as a virtue. However, in the world of psychology and philosophy, rebellion has often been interpreted as a behavior that people who have reached the stage of self-realization will dare. The phenomenon of "rebellion", which has been commented on many times, was handled with a philosophical orientation by Albert Camus. For Camus, who was also interested in existentialism, the basis of the rebellion is the questions about existence and existence, the answers that cannot be found exactly, and the sense of "absurd" that people feel in life that they remain unanswered. Camus considers life and the world as irrational and evaluates the way people view this irrationality, the way they feel and think, as "absurd". Most of the time, this becomes a problem that needs to be solved for the person. Rebellion is one way of solving this problem. For Camus, who divides the rebellious human types into four, it is the "artist" type who realizes the most moral and ideal rebellion. The artist accepts the absurd, but also rebels against its consequences. The artist accepts the absurd, but on the other hand, rebels against the results it has created, instead constructing a new form in own world. The rebellious artist type of Camus can be seen in Pir Sultan's poems in Turkish folklore. The rebellion of Pir Sultan, one of the most important representatives of the Alevi Bektashi poetry tradition, develops in the axis of the Alevi-Sunni, Ottoman-Safavid opposition, sometimes it turns into a general attitude towards life itself and is reflected in his poems. In many of his poems, he complains about the Ottoman sultan, beys, pashas, kadis, and replaces them with Iranian shahs, and sees them as a way to get rid of the feeling of absurdity that is growing day by day. The "ideal world" felt in the background of Pir Sultan's poems is a world where injustices are not experienced and where Hz. Muhammad, Hz. Ali and the Twelve Imams live. In his poems, he creates the representations of the figures in the present time, by bringing the figures he opposes with anger and the figures he longs for. How the sense of "nonsense" emerged in Pir Sultan, the social structure in which he lived, and the events he heard or witnessed becomes understandable when examined. How the sense of nonsense is reflected in his poems and how he copes with this emotion are questions that need to be answered. In this study, the sources of the sense of the absurd in Pir Sultan's poems, how they are reflected in his poems, and the codes of the rebellion of Pir Sultan, who chose art and rebellion to deal with the absurd, based on the examples of poetry. While the analysis was being conducted, the "Pir Sultans" discussions were kept out of the way, and independently of these discussions, considering that Pir Sultan is a tradition, the poems to be discussed in the study were chosen from among the poems published by Ibrahim Aslanoglu, Cahit oztelli and Pertev Naili Boratav and Abdulbaki Golpinarli.

TI  - Comparing Surgical and Oncological Outcomes between Indocyanine Green (ICG) Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping with Routine Lymphadenectomy in the Surgical Staging of Early-Stage Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer.
T2  - Obstetrics and gynecology international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Methods: A retrospective single-centre cohort study of patients with early-stage endometrioid endometrial cancer undergoing staging surgery (total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with/without pelvic lymph node, and/or para-aortic lymph node dissection (PLND)) with either SLN mapping or routine lymphadenectomy between July 2017 and December 2018.Results: 203 cases with clinical and radiological International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I endometrioid endometrial cancer were included, out of which 109 cases underwent SLN mapping and 94 cases complete lymphadenectomy. Compared to the PLND group, the SLN group had shorter operative time (129 vs. 162minutes), less blood loss (100 vs. 300ml), and decreased length of postoperative hospital stay (3 vs. 4days) (p < 0.001). The lymph node metastases detection rate was 4.6% and 7.4% for the SLN and PLND groups, respectively (p = 0.389). With a median follow-up of 14months for the SLN and 15months for the PLND group, the disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were comparable for both at 13months (p = 0.538 and p = 0.333, respectively).Conclusion: SLN mapping has been shown to be an acceptable alternative to routine lymphadenectomy in the surgical staging of early-stage endometrial cancer in our centre, with a comparable lymph node metastases detection rate, DFS and OS, and reduction in operative morbidity. Our results with SLN mapping reproduce comparable outcomes to those reported in the literature.

TI  - T Cell CEACAM1-TIM-3 Crosstalk Alleviates Liver Transplant Injury in Mice and Humans.
T2  - Gastroenterology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CC1) acts through homophilic and heterophilic interactions with T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3), which regulates innate immune activation in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). We investigated whether cluster of differentiation (CD) 4+ T cell-dependent CC1-TIM-3 crosstalk may affect OLT outcomes in mice and humans.METHODS: Wild-type (WT) and CC1-deficient (CC1 knock-out [KO]) mouse livers were transplanted into WT, CC1KO, or T-cell TIM-3 transgenic (TIM-3Tg)/CC1KO double-mutant recipients. CD4+ T cells were adoptively transferred into T/B cell-deficient recombination activating gene 2 protein (Rag2) KO recipients, followed by OLT. The perioperative liver-associated CC1 increase was analyzed in 50 OLT patients.RESULTS: OLT injury in WT livers deteriorated in CC1KO compared with CC1-proficient (WT) recipients. The frequency of TIM-3+CD4+ T cells was higher in WT than CC1KO hosts. Reconstitution of Rag2KO mice with CC1KO-T cells increased nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB phosphorylation and OLT damage compared with recipients repopulated with WT T cells. T-cell TIM-3 enhancement in CC1KO recipients (WT TIM3Tg/CC1KO) suppressed NF-kappaB phosphorylation in Kupffer cells and mitigated OLT injury. However, TIM-3-mediated protection was lost by pharmacologic TIM-3 blockade or an absence of CC1 in the donor liver (CC1KO TIM-3Tg/CC1KO). The perioperative CC1 increase in human OLT reduced hepatocellular injury, early allograft dysfunction, and the cumulative rejection rate.CONCLUSIONS: This translational study identifies T cell-specific CC1 signaling as a therapeutic means to alleviate OLT injury by promoting T cell-intrinsic TIM-3, which in turn interacts with liver-associated CC1 to suppress NF-kappaB in Kupffer cells. By suppressing peritransplant liver damage, promoting T-cell homeostasis, and improving OLT outcomes, recipient CC1 signaling serves as a novel cytoprotective sentinel.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an update of the Snow and Ice (SICE) property retrieval algorithm based on the spectral measurements of Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3 satellites combined with the asymptotic radiative transfer theory valid for weakly absorbing turbid media. The main improvements include the introduction of a new atmospheric correction, retrieval of snow impurity load and properties, retrievals for partially snow-covered ground and also accounting for various thresholds to be used to assess the retrieval quality. The technique can be applied to various optical sensors (satellite and ground-based) operated in the visible and near infrared regions of electromagnetic spectra.

TI  - Evaluating the climatic and socio-economic influences on the agricultural drought vulnerability in Jharkhand
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental hazards like drought lead to degrading food production and adversely impact the agro-economy. This study investigates the contributions of different climatic and socio-economic variables to agricultural drought in Jharkhand. The three primary criteria, i.e., exposure (E), sensitivity (S), and adaptive capacity (AC), responsible for agricultural drought vulnerability, were examined to identify the drought-prone areas. Long-term (1958-2020) gridded climatic datasets obtained from the Terra-climate global dataset, MODIS vegetation index dataset (MOD13Q1) for the years 2001-2020, different soil parameters obtained from the ISRIC global soil database and state agricultural portal of Jharkhand, and different socio-economic datasets obtained from census data (2011) provided by Govt. of India, were utilized for this study. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to estimate the weighted contribution of the indicator variables falling under each criterion (E, S, and AC), and three criteria index maps were generated. These separate maps were further integrated to generate the final vulnerability index map. Finally, the study area was categorized into different zones based on the drought vulnerability index value ranging from 0 to 1, according to the severity of the drought. It was observed that about 4.05%, 28.12%, and 37.07% of the total geographical area is very highly, highly, and moderately vulnerable to agricultural drought, respectively. Amongst the three primary criteria, exposure showed a significant positive correlation (R = 0.61), and sensitivity showed a strong positive correlation (R = 0.55) with vulnerability. The adaptive capacity was negatively correlated (R = -0.75) with the vulnerability. However, putting equal weights to the variables to calculate the vulnerability, the exposure and sensitivity indicators showed a significant positive correlation with the vulnerability, with an R-value of 0.82 and 0.79, respectively. In contrast, the adaptive capacity showed a negative correlation with the vulnerability with R = -0.75.

TI  - Neurosemantic characteristics of common words in the Tuvan language through the prism of a complex psycholinguistic experiment
T2  - NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study is to describe the neurosemantic characteristics of 73 nouns used in the oral speech of the Tuvans: 55 are words of the Tuvan language, 18 are from Russian. We obtained the word list in a psycholinguistic experiment with 150 Tuvan-Russian bilinguals whose average age was 22.6 years. Five groups of noun stimuli were identified: culturally significant words (names of rituals and their elements, natural objects with a high symbolic load in the traditional worldview, kinship terms); zoonyms; names of household objects in Tuvan, names of household objects in Russian, and vocabulary of the everyday.The research problem lies in the field of joint inquiries of cognitive linguistics, neurosemantics and aphasiology. It is a case of searching for a neural correlate that is called the meaning of a word in traditional linguistics. According to F. Pulvermuller's neurosemantic conception, such a correlate is a distributed structure of neurons. In being activated, they allow a person to get a "feeling" of a word and provide understanding. In order to conduct the experiment, we used a methodology already well-tested in perceptual semantics to identify such psycholinguistic properties of words as subjective frequency, age of acquisition, imageability, familiarity with a concept. The novelty of the work is that for the first time using the Tuvan language material we have found out which groups of words different psycholinguistic properties are essential for and which neurosemantic characteristics of words they correlate with (sensorimotor experience, visual perception, experience of engagement with a word).We hypothesize about factors affecting the identified characteristics of words and specify words that have neural correlates with the strongest connections. It has been found out that in case of culturally significant words the property "familiarity with a concept" turns out to be relatively high in value and the strongest in influence on other properties; in case of zoonyms it is "imageability"; in case of everyday vocabulary it is "subjective frequency" which strongly correlates with the "age of acquisition". It is "familiarity with a concept" in case of names of household items in Tuvan. The subjective frequency has the greatest influence on other properties in Russian.The reflection of the informants has shown that the household sphere is most affected by the competition between words of the native and non-native languages. Those Tuvan words which are most deeply influenced by this competition have the lowest values of psycholinguistic properties.

M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of the research. the issue of reconstruction of the circle of commu-nication of the famous mineralogist, academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic yevhen kostiantynovych lazarenko (1912- 1979) is highlighted. the main statistical data, collected as a result of processing the block of personal correspondence of the scientist's fond, has been made public, and a brief source-scientific description of the most interesting documents has been pre-sented, including scientific correspondence with famous domestic and foreign scien-tists during 1943-1978, deposited in the fonds of the Institute of Archival Studies of the V. I. Vernadskyi National Library of Ukraine. Methodology. Special methods are applied - historical-biographical, historical-comparative, historical-chronological, historical-typological, retrospective, and methods of source analysis. The specified approach allows to analyze the species composition and informative potential of the scientist's epistolary in order to distinguish the directions, tasks, content, quantity and geographical boundaries of his scientific communication. Scientific novelty. A complex of little-known epistolary sources is included in the scientific circulation, which will make it possible to fill informative gaps in the general picture of the national and international activities of the famous Ukrainian mineralogist Lazarenko, and serves as a valuable source for studying his creative activity and professional contacts. Conclusions. It was determined that the scientist's circle of correspondence is determined by his special life activity in the professional sphere. The correspondence of Lazarenko acts as a powerful informational factor for the study of epistolary communication with a cohort of the world's leading scientists, provides additional information on his scientific-organizational, pedagogical, and publishing activities. It serves as an important source of studying the scientist's life experience, his worldview, life values, individual character traits, and also reveals the degree of kinship or familiarity of the author with the addressee and common preferences.

TI  - NOMADIC MODELS OF POSTMODERN AESTHETICS: SOTERIOLOGICAL CHOICE OF THE TEACHER
T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATION CULTURE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. The aim of the article is to define the concept of aesthetic competence of the nomad teacher of postmodern era based on a comparative analysis of two aesthetic models (metis paraesthetics and soteriological aesthetics). Methods. The subject of study is anthropotemporal methodology of acquiring aesthetic competence as an act of spiritual transformation (approaches, paradigm, priorities, criteria of effectiveness). The analysis of the stages of nomad's dianoic choice in the process of understanding beauty as a boon was carried out using the method of epistemological design, according to which emotions function cogniti-vely in aesthetic experience. The technology of spiritual self-coaching was chosen to activate all the structural components of aesthetic competence - the intention to correct aesthetic apperception and the competencies of emotional-reflective, value--semantic, aesthetic and worldview revaluation. Results. The implementation of the chosen technology opened up the possibility of reorientation for the nomad teacher: from the drive of the performer-trickster to a humble and grateful anticipation of the beauty as transcendent - to overcoming the power of inertia of previous dependence, responses to the calls of a pure (still "adventurous") mind. A cluster analysis of the results of the completed tasks was carried out for the regression description of the efficiency of the technology. Conclusion. The soteriological concept of the aesthetic competence of the nomad teacher focuses attention on the essential coexistence of the teacher with students throughout the entire process of his self-determination. The practical experience of its implementation can make a positive contribution to reforming postmodern aesthetic education.

AB  - In Fall 2021, SpaceLink Corporation was selected by the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), manager of the International Space Station (ISS) U.S. National Laboratory, for a demonstration of its end-to-end space data relay service. SpaceLink will provide secure, continuous communications between terrestrial operators and an optical terminal on the ISS, enabling real-time, high-throughput connectivity for the onboard crew, systems, and various science experiments. In a highly competitive process, made available for companies and research teams to propose technology development concepts operating in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), CASIS selected the SpaceLink concept. With this selection, SpaceLink will advance its flight project in collaboration with the ISS National Laboratory. The SpaceLink relay network will succeed and exceed NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) with unprecedented capacity that leverages the latest optical communications technology advances. Demand for high-throughput, continuous orbital connectivity continues to grow with the ongoing proliferation of LEO satellites. SpaceLink's network is designed to help close the business case for Earth observation companies, commercial space stations, satellite services, launch vehicles, and space tugs. It also meets the requirements of the U.S. Government and close allies that are leveraging real-time, secure communications solutions. The SpaceLink ISS demonstration will validate a 10 Gigabit per second (Gbps) optical terminal communication link for realtime voice, video, and data relay for the ISS. Axiom Space, SpaceLink's implementation partner, will leverage its expertise in working with NASA and the ISS National Laboratory to support the SpaceLink payload mission integration, launch, and operations. Axiom will support SpaceLink as a liaison with NASA and will lead safety reviews to ensure SpaceLink hardware meets all ISS requirements. The SpaceLink-ISS Connectivity End to End Demonstration (SLICED) will demonstrate the highest data rates that can be achieved between SpaceLink relay spacecraft in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and the ISS, an example user satellite in LEO. The demonstration will include MEO-LEO edge case geometries where the relative range rates between the satellites are the highest and required contact acquisition times are shortest. SpaceLink's real-time gigabit user data rates are possible via optical inter-satellite communications between spacecraft, as well as high-bandwidth Q/V-band communications between SpaceLink's relay spacecraft and terrestrial gateways. SpaceLink has designed an innovative system architecture, implementing high-security services and continuous availability so that satellite data is available in real time when it matters the most. This study will discuss the technical foundation behind SpaceLink's ISS demonstration infrastructure.

TI  - Metaphysical and Anthropological Principles of the Self-Made-Man Idea in Western Philosophy of the 17th Century
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The main purpose of this research is to comprehend the philosophical principles in the spread and legitimation of the Self-made-man idea in the worldview transformations of the 17th century. Theoretical basis. Historical and comparative methods became fundamental ones for the research. The research is based on the creative heritage of R. Descartes, T. Hobbes, J. Locke, as well as the works of modern researchers. Originality. The analysis shows that the Self-made-man idea, which originated in the ancient world and gradually spreads in the Christian Middle Ages, gained a powerful impetus in the philosophical and moral-legal metamorphoses of the 17th century. These metamorphoses theoretically substantiated and radically accelerated the transition from mystical to rational, from theocentric to the anthropocentric worldview, and, as a result, to the recognition of the intellectual autonomy of the individuals and the freedom of their own will, the emergence of the construct of natural human rights, the requirements of religious tolerance and freedom of conscience, ultimately, to the principle of reliance on one's own strength and the individual's personal responsibility for one's own destiny. Exactly these ideas in interaction with the ideas of Puritanism became the theoretical basis for the formation of B. Franklin's views and the corresponding cultural code. Conclusions. The philosophy of the 17th century, having laid the principles of a new - subject-centric - metaphysics, as well as the philosophical and legal foundations of liberal ideology, provided philosophical and moral-legal legitimation to the sporadic attempts of man to break out of the triple circle of fatalism, paternalism, and conformity to a rationally founded and the ever-growing orientation of the individual towards active self-determination and self-realization, self-reliance and personal responsibility for their own destiny as key principles of the Self-made-man concept.

TI  - The social dimension of the new atheism*
T2  - FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the socio-political aspect of the new atheism. Within the framework of this phenomenon, initially associated with the four bestselling authors R. Dawkins, S. Harris, K. Hitchens, D. Dennett, who launched the "fight against religion" in the mid 2000s, a community and a weakly organized movement eventually formed. A number of connected questions are considered: characteristics of the phenomenon of new atheism (origins, sources, specifics); perception of atheism and new atheism by society in the USA and Great Britain; political views of key figures of the new atheism, external assessment of their political influence; views and activity of supporters, external assessment of the socio-political influence of the movement. The article focuses on the aspects of the new atheism as a movement in the USA and the UK. The author comes to the following conclusions: the "creators" of the new atheism scarcely touch upon the socio-political agenda in their activities (the main foreign policy interest is the fight against Islamic terrorism); currently, the new atheism as a movement and a community reacts to politics rather than forms it; not all actions of new atheists aimed at reducing the social and political presence of religion or at reducing discrimination against atheists achieve their goals; the main achievement of the new atheism movement is that atheism as a worldview ceases to be a marginal agenda, and non-believers receive a formalized, positively colored identity for themselves. The latter is important in the context of discrimination of non-believers against believers, which in the United States takes place both in the public consciousness and even at the highest political level.

TI  - Extent of surgical procedure in triple negative breast carcinomas.
T2  - Rozhledy v chirurgii : mesicnik Ceskoslovenske chirurgicke spolecnosti
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Triple negative breast carcinomas (TNBC) account for approximately 15-20% of all breast carcinomas. This subtype is characterised by an unfavourable prognosis with early locoregional recurrence a metastases. Only few studies have focused on the impact of local surgery on the overall therapeutic outcome. However, decisions are difficult to make in the case of TNBC, and no particular molecular subtype or marker exists that would make the decision-making process easier. The aim of our retrospective study was to analyse the TNBC surgical management outcomes at EUC Clinic in Zlin.METHODS: 440 women with breast carcinoma were operated on at EUC Clinic from 2014 to 2016, including 29 patients with TNBC; bilateral carcinoma was present in one case. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was indicated in 6 cases. The tumour centre was marked with a clip. The extent of surgery depended on the residual size of the tumour. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was indicated in clinically negative lymph nodes; further management followed the Z0011 study if the biopsy was positive. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed after NAC. In all cases, surgery was followed by systemic chemotherapy, and by radiotherapy in the case of breast-conserving procedures.RESULTS: The group included 29 women and one patient with bilateral carcinoma, i.e. 30 cases of TNBC. Mean age was 57 years and median age was 55.5 years. Mean follow-up was 62.9 months, with the median of 69.9 month. NAC was indicated in 6 patients; complete pathological response was achieved in one case. NAC was followed by mastectomy in 5 cases including a bilateral procedure in one case, and by breast-conserving surgery in one case. Axillary dissection was performed in all cases. Breast-conserving surgery and sentinel node biopsy predominated in the group (16 cases). Local recurrence was observed in 4 cases, 2 times as an isolated local recurrence after one year and 2 times as part of generalization, always after mastectomy. Six patients died of generalized disease. No regional recurrence was observed.CONCLUSION: TNBC is characterised by a worse prognosis and a higher rate of local recurrence. As confirmed by our study, the results of breast-conserving surgery can be comparable to those of radical procedures, and thus radical surgery should be indicated prudently.

TI  - BERNHARD AND JELINEK: THE POETICS OF "ENDLESS TIRADES"
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article compares the poetics of two Austrian writers, Thomas Bernhard (1931-1989) and Elf- riede Jelinek (born 1946) in terms of its performativity and musicality. The expression "literature of endless tirades" appears for the first time in the obituary written by Jelinek in memory of Thomas Bernhard, who died of an in- curable disease (sarcoidosis). This text can also be considered as a manifest of Jelinek's own poetology. The met- aphor of the writer's "body-factory", forced to generate text continuously to go on living, put forward by Jelinek in relation to Bernhard, is considered by the author of this article as a key to the interpretation of the "sequential" (C. Marten) style of two Austrian authors. Rejecting the verisimilitude and narrative coherence of realism, Bern- hard and Jelinek replace "the order of mimesis" (C. Prendergast) by linear-compositional coherence, imitating the forms of jazz improvisation, baroque polyphony, or the technique of Wagner's "endless melody". A comparative analysis of their prose, essays and some dramas has revealed the following common features of style: 1) manner- ism as a reflection of the modernist hermetic tradition, as well as a style that allows resisting the pop culture, with its requirement in relation to a work of art to be easily understandable and comfortable for the reader; 2) preference of theatre and music, reflected in the performativity of the texts; 3) conceptualization of the world as the baroque theatrum mundi; 4) tragicomic worldview; 5) ambivalent representation of the fragment and the whole, death and life through the dialectics of destruction and figuration, often in the form of parodia sacra; 6) ex-istential interpretation of silence versus speech as death versus postponement of death respectively; 7) creation of quasi-musical prose, in which the rhythmic-syntactic and compositional principles are emphasized; 8) deliberate exaggeration of the histrionic nature of fiction world and language; 9) self-reflexivity of literary form. These po- etological features make it possible to reveal a kind of "elective affinities" (Goethe) of the two Austrian writers, and to interpret their poetics of "endless tirades" as a result of an intense search for the lost classical integrity of form and meaning, which can be resurrected in the 20th - early 21st century only in the form of grotesque.

TI  - Timing and Trends for Municipal Wastewater, Lab-Confirmed Case , and Syndromic Case Surveillance of COVID-19 in Raleigh, North Carolina
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To compare 4 COVID-19 surveillance metrics in a major metropolitan area.Methods. We analyzed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in wastewater influent and primary solids in Raleigh, North Carolina, from April 10 through December 13, 2020. We compared wastewater results with lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases and syndromic COVID-like illness (CLI) cases to answer 3 questions: (1) Did they correlate? (2) What was the temporal alignment of the different surveillance systems? (3) Did periods of significant change (i.e., trends) align?Results. In the Raleigh sewershed, wastewater influent, wastewater primary solids, lab-confirmed cases, and CLI were strongly or moderately correlated. Trends in lab-confirmed cases and wastewater influent were observed earlier, followed by CLI and, lastly, wastewater primary solids. All 4 metrics showed sustained increases in COVID-19 in June, July, and November 2020 and sustained decreases in August and September 2020.Conclusions. In a major metropolitan area in 2020, the timing of and trends in municipal wastewater, lab-confirmed case, and syndromic case surveillance of COVID-19 were in general agreement.Public Health Implications. Our results provide evidence for investment in SARS-CoV-2 wastewater and CLI surveillance to complement information provided through lab-confirmed cases.

AB  - The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant progress in the field of wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) of respiratory pathogens and highlighted its potential for a wider application in public health surveillance. This study aimed to evaluate whether monitoring of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in wastewater can provide a comprehensive picture of disease transmission at the community level. The study was conducted in Larissa (Central Greece) between October 2022 and January 2023. Forty-six wastewater samples were collected from the inlet of the wastewater treatment plant of Larissa and analyzed with a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based method. RSV and SARS-CoV-2 wastewater viral loads (genome copies/100,000 inhabitants) were analyzed against sentinel surveillance data on influenza-like illness (ILI) to identify potential associations. Univariate linear regression analysis revealed that RSV wastewater viral load (lagged by one week) and ILI notification rates in children up to 14 years old were strongly associated (std. Beta: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.31-1.14), p = 0.002, R2 = 0.308). A weaker association was found between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and ILI rates in the 15+ age group (std. Beta: 0.56 (95% CI: 0.06-1.05), p = 0.032, R2 = 0.527). The results support the incorporation of RSV monitoring into existing wastewater-based surveillance systems.

TI  - A Real-World Benchmark for Sentinel-2 Multi-Image Super-Resolution.
T2  - Scientific data
M3  - Dataset
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Insufficient image spatial resolution is a serious limitation in many practical scenarios, especially when acquiring images at a finer scale is infeasible or brings higher costs. This is inherent to remote sensing, including Sentinel-2 satellite images that are available free of charge at a high revisit frequency, but whose spatial resolution is limited to 10m ground sampling distance. The resolution can be increased with super-resolution algorithms, in particular when performed from multiple images captured at subsequent revisits of a satellite, taking advantage of information fusion that leads to enhanced reconstruction accuracy. One of the obstacles in multi-image super-resolution consists in the scarcity of real-world benchmarks-commonly, simulated data are exploited which do not fully reflect the operating conditions. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark (named MuS2) for super-resolving multiple Sentinel-2 images, with WorldView-2 imagery used as the high-resolution reference. Within MuS2, we publish the first end-to-end evaluation procedure for this problem which we expect to help the researchers in advancing the state of the art in multi-image super-resolution.

TI  - CASE STUDY OF ON-THE-SPOT AND SURFACE MEDIEVAL OBJECTS- VERIFYING CURRENT REMOTE METHODS OF DOCUMENTING ARCHEOLGICAL SIDES
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the limitations of satellite techniques in archaeological investigations is the land cover. Heritage objects may be more or less visible depending on the land cover type. Low vegetation, such as grass or small shrubs, will usually allow us to determine the location of archaeological objects if the difference in height between the object and vegetation is not significant enough. Forest or high vegetation cover makes it more challenging to determine the location of potentially artificial structures. This project's study area covered 50x70 km of the lower reaches of the Vistula River, Poland. The authors searched for anthropogenic objects close to watercourses and analysed nine different (point, line and surface type) objects having a defensive, sepulchral or settlement function. Circular objects, ditches and earth embankments, burial mounds and strongholds of regular forms were found during this research. Based on nine different models processed with LiDAR-based DEMs, several characteristics and relationships of various types of objects were demonstrated. Moreover, optimal models for searching for archaeological objects in forest areas were defined.

TI  - Performance and validation of water surface temperature estimates from Landsat 8 of the Itaipu Reservoir, State of Parana, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on water surface temperature (WST) from thermal infrared remote sensing are still incipient in Brazil, and for many water resources, they do not exist. Many algorithms have been developed to estimate surface temperature in satellite images. There are also many difficulties in implementing these algorithms due to their complexity, especially in free software, which restricts the satisfactory processing of these data by users of the technique. Thus, this work aimed to validate an algorithm used to estimate land surface temperature (LST) when applied to the surface of inland water bodies. Water surface temperature estimates (WSTe) were generated from Itaipu State of Parana (PR) reservoir, Brazil, calculated from Landsat 8 - TIRS satellite images (WSTs) and water surface temperature data from 37 in situ stations (WSTi). A linear regression model of the WSTe was generated in 60% of the samples and its validation with the remaining 40%, subject to prior evaluation of some statistical indicators. The model was considered significant since the coefficient of determination (r(2)) was 0.90 (95% of confidence), root mean square deviation (RMSD) 0.8 degrees C, Willmott Index (d) = 0.97, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) = 0.89. The methodology used to extract WSTs from the Python QGIS plugin was relatively quick to apply, easy to understand, and had a better performance of the estimates than those presented in the literature review.

TI  - Robust Estimates of the Total Alkalinity From Satellite Oceanographic Data in the Global Ocean
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Total alkalinity (TA) is a key parameter to understand the dynamics of biogeochemical properties in the global ocean and the effects of climate change on ocean acidification, ocean carbon cycle, and carbonate chemistry. To date, global surface ocean distributions of TA were investigated using multiple regional regression approaches which require smoothening techniques due to severe boundary effects in different oceanic regions/basins across latitudes/longitudes. To reduce the uncertainties and produce spatially and temporally consistent TA products, a novel single linear regression (SLR) approach was developed in this study to estimate TA fields in the global surface ocean waters. The SLR formulation was derived using the continuous in-situ measurements of sea surface salinity (SSS) collected from the different oceans. The performance of the SLR was assessed using independent in-situ/satellite derived TA data and the results from three existing algorithms. In general, the SLR-based global surface ocean TA fields from both in-situ and satellite data agreed well with in-situ measured TA data with a mean relative error less than 1%, which is much lower compared to the error with the existing algorithms. Studies were also conducted to examine the spatiotemporal variability and trends in the global surface ocean climatology of SSS and TA fields in the context of current climate change impacts.

TI  - Robust Algorithm Based on the Reflectance Curvature for Estimating Particulate Organic Carbon and its Spatiotemporal Variability in the Global Ocean
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of particulate organic carbon (POC) is essential for the studies of biological carbon export from the surface to the deep ocean, carbon-based net primary production, phytoplankton growth rate, and global carbon cycle. Despite the number of regional and global algorithms reported in earlier studies, an accurate estimation of POC and its spatiotemporal variability from satellite ocean color data are often hampered by biases associated with the algorithm parameterizations and a lack of in situ data for the coastal oceans with complex physical and biogeochemical processes (such as physical mixing, biological production, horizontal and vertical transport of POC through the ocean currents and circulations, and POC sinking fluxes). In this study, we developed a simple maximum band ratio index (MBRI) algorithm based on global in situ POC and remote sensing reflectance data and validated and intercompared with existing algorithms using independent in situ and MODIS-Aqua POC data in global oceanic waters. In general, the POC products estimated by the MBRI algorithm have greater accuracy with a mean relative error of 0.218, a root mean square error of 34.07, and a correlation coefficient of 0.88. The MBRI approach was further applied to time-series satellite data to analyze the spatiotemporal variations and trends in POC in regional/global oceanic waters as well as the Arctic Ocean (AO) region. This study highlighted a substantial change and an increase in POC fields in the AO region in response to global climate change over the recent decades.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of the value-worldview aspect of modern university edu-cation. The "mass university" of the last quarter of the 20th - early 21st centuries, which set itself the underestimated task of "providing educational services" for the formation of a soci-ety of "qualified consumers", practically ignored the classical experience of transferring knowl-edge associated with the spiritual education of the personality of an intellectual, the formation of his worldview. The Fundamentals of State Policy for the Preservation and Strengthening of Traditional Russian Spiritual and Moral Values, put into effect in 2022 by the Decree of the President of Russia, require overcoming this defect of the modern educational paradigm and bringing its parameters to adequate traditions and modern realities of the social norm. The authors of the article dedicate that in accordance with the list of the main traditional Russian values given in the documents of the strategic development of Russia, it is necessary to por-tray the image of a university graduate in the middle of the 21st century as a highly qualified specialist with critical thinking, historical memory and a broad cultural horizon. For this, among other things, it is necessary to solve an interdisciplinary task: to bring the most im-portant value and worldview concepts into the normative system, to make the list generally understandable and generally accepted for all participants in the processes of education and upbringing. This should be work involving specialists in various fields of knowledge, includ-ing philologists, lawyers, educators, philosophers, cultural and political scientists, sociologists and, no doubt, theologians. The theology of Christianity and other traditional religions ads the deepest and most complete source of value worldview. Therefore, according to the authors of the article, basic theological principles should become a necessary element of education in a modern Russian university.

AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of the worldview of Louis Bonaparte, his ideas about the political prospects of mankind, which include generalizing judg-ments about the meaning of the French Revolution, about the significance of Napoleonic rule for social life. Of course, for Louis Bonaparte the theoretical works he wrote served as a means of promoting his own political aspirations, a kind of justification for the ambitions that inspired him, but also a certain philosophical support on the life path. Created by him even before coming to power, they may well be coordinated with the subsequent actions of the new-ly president of the republic, and then the emperor. He attached the most world-view importance to the image of Napoleon, which was interpreted as the focus of the leading lines of social development. Progress, justice, the social hierar-chy determined by merit, the confederation of free European states - these are the main features of the near future in his understanding. Like representatives of Saint-Simonianism, Louis Bonaparte called for the care of the poorest, most suffering class. His social project provided for the creation of agricultural colonies on abandoned, uncultivated sites. The liquidation of unemployment, in his opinion, could eliminate extreme poverty from everyday life. But, unlike Saint-Simon, he attached much greater importance to the role of the state and the centralization of power, did not consider Napoleon to be a defender of the obsolete feudal system. The example of Napoleon III shows a special way of mutual influence of philosophy and power: his social concept was formed primarily as a result of a very specific understanding of the decisions of his illustrious predecessor, this concept embodied an explicit desire for the post of head of state, and at the same time it found, albeit incomplete, reflection in politics of the Second Empire.

TI  - Estimating Ensemble Likelihoods for the Sentinel-1-Based Global Flood Monitoring Product of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Flood Monitoring (GFM) system of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service addresses the challenges and impacts that are caused by flooding. The GFM system provides global, near-real-time flood extent masks for each newly acquired Sentinel-1 Interferometric wide swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image, as well as flood information from the whole Sentinel-1 archive from 2015 on. The GFM flood extent is an ensemble product based on a combination of three independently developed flood mapping algorithms that individually derive the flood information from Sentinel-1 data. Each flood algorithm also provides classification uncertainty information that is aggregated into the GFM ensemble likelihood product as the mean of the individual classification likelihoods. As the flood detection algorithms derive uncertainty information with different methods, the value range of the three input likelihoods must be harmonized to a range from low [0] to high [100] flood likelihood. The ensemble likelihood is evaluated on two test sites in Myanmar and Somalia, showcasing the performance during an actual flood event and an area with challenging conditions for SAR-based flood detection. The Myanmar use case demonstrates the robustness if flood detections in the ensemble step disagree and how that information is communicated to the end-user. The Somalia use case demonstrates a setting where misclassifications are likely, how the ensemble process mitigates false detections and how the flood likelihoods can be interpreted to use such results with adequate caution.

TI  - SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF SURFACE WATER EXTRACTION METHODS RELIABILITY USING COPERNICUS SATELLITE DATA
T2  - GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research is the comparison and subsequent evaluation of the suitability of using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and multispectral (MSI) satellite data of the Copernicus program for mapping and accurate identification of surface water bodies. The paper considers sudden changes caused by significant climatological-meteorological influences in the country. The surface guidance extraction methodology includes the standard preprocessing of SAR images and concluding the determination of threshold values in binary mask generation. For MSI images, water masks are generated through automatic algorithmic processing on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. During SAR image processing, it has been found that the VV polarization configuration type (vertical-vertical) is the most suitable. The Lee and Lee Sigma filters are recommended for eliminating radar noise. The chosen window size for filtering depends on the specific object and its spatial extent. The extraction of water surfaces from the MSI image is conducted using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), a pair of Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) indices, and Water Ratio Index (WRI). Results are evaluated both graphically and numerically, using quantitative accuracy indicators to refine them. Automatic extraction of water surfaces from MSI images in the GEE platform environment is a fast, efficient, and relatively accurate tool for determining the true extent of groundwater. In conclusion, this research can provide more reliable estimates of hydrological changes and interannual variations in water bodies in the country. When combined with multitemporal monitoring, these results can be an effective tool for permanent monitoring of floods and droughts.

TI  - Joint Use of Optical and Radar Remote Sensing Data for Characterizing the 2020 Aniangzhai Landslide Post-Failure Displacement
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ancient Aniangzhai (ANZ) landslide in Danba County, Sichuan Province of southwest China was reactivated after a series of complex hazard events that occurred in June 2020. Since then, and until June 2021, emergency engineering work was carried out to prevent the further failure of the reactivated landslide. This study investigates the potential of joint use of time series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and optical pixel offset tracking (POT) to assess deformation characteristic and spatial-temporal evolution of the reactivated ANZ landslide during the post-failure stage. The relationships between sun illumination differences, temporal baseline of correlation pairs and the uncertainties were deeply explored. Surface deformation along the line-of-sight (LoS) direction was retrieved by the time series InSAR processing with the two Sentinel-1 datasets, revealing a maximum deformation rate up to 190 mm/year. The large horizontal displacements were also detected from the POT processing using 11 optical images acquired by the PlanetScope satellite (3 m spatial resolution), showing a significant increase of about 24 m between 24 June 2020 and 11 June 2021. The time series analysis from the InSAR and optical POT results revealed that the reactivated ANZ landslide body is gradually slowing down to a steady deformation status since its occurrence in August 2020, indicating the effectiveness of engineering work on the prevention of further landslide. A slight acceleration was detected from both InSAR and optical POT time series analysis between May 2021 and June 2021, which could be caused by the increased rainfall in May 2021.

TI  - Agricultural Field Boundary Delineation Using a Cascaded Deep Network Model From Polarized SAR and Multispectral Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate acquisition of farmland boundary information is an important means for agricultural production data statistics. Due to the extreme imbalance of categories in farmland boundary extraction tasks, the direct use of neural networks for boundary pixel prediction in remote sensing images often results in poor performance. This article investigates the beneficial effects of multisource remote sensing data fusion and the use of semantic segmentation to assist in boundary extraction. The research area of this work covers an area of approximately 600 km(2) of farmland located in northern Xinjiang. And the obtained Sentinel-2 multispectral images covered the area, as well as Sentinel-1 dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images with multiple temporal phases. A novel cascaded model of semantic segmentation and edge detection is proposed for the boundary extraction task of farmland. Using the fused data of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 as the raw data input of the model for semantic segmentation of farmland and nonfarmland. Then, the semantically segmented feature map is overlaid with the original data to detect the edge and extract the farmland boundary. The results show that after adding the SAR data, the extraction effect of farmland boundaries has been significantly improved. Moreover, compared with directly using neural network models for boundary extraction, using semantic segmentation information to assist in boundary extraction can achieve higher extraction accuracy. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the feasibility of combining SAR remote sensing information to optimize the extraction of farmland boundaries.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: To estimate the effects of environmental and human drivers on upper forest-cover upward shift over the period 1945-2018.Location: Romanian Carpathians.Methods: Using historical topographic maps and high-resolution Sentinel-2A satellite images, we delineated the location of the upper forest-cover limit in 1945 and 2018 to obtain a binary raster with the "forest gains " and "no-forest gains " for 1945-2018. The maps were overlapped over 12 independent variables to estimate how they affected the recent upper forest-cover upward shift, and to predict its probability of expansion in the near future. To achieve this, logistic regression models were applied and then integrated into the GIS spatial analysis.Results: Forest gains of almost 35,000 ha have been detected at the upper forest limit in the study sites, leading to an average upward movement of 30 m (0.5 m per year), mainly at the altitudinal bands between 1,400 and 1,800 m a.s.l. (72%); only 9.7% of the gain was detected above the estimated potential climatic limit. The process was significantly inversely related to elevation (-17.3 <= beta <=-5.7, p < 0.01), slope aspect (-1.5 <= beta <=-0.4, p < 0.01), sheepfold numbers (-18.1 & LE; beta & LE; -0.7, p < 0.01), and sheep (-18.3 <= beta <= -0.6, p < 0.01) and cattle (-16.4 <= beta <=-0.8, p < 0.01) populations. Strong direct effects were found for the slope angle (1.3 <= beta <= 10.6, p < 0.01) and distance to sheepfolds (0.5 <= beta <= 12.8, p < 0.01). A low contribution was indicated for the trend in mean air temperature (-1.1 <=beta <= 4.3, p < 0.01), growing season length (-2.1 <= beta <= 5.1, p < 0.01) and protective measures (-1.1 <= beta <= 2.4, p < 0.01, for national parks; -1.8 <=beta <= 1.2, p < 0.01, for natural parks).Conclusions: The analysis demonstrated that decreased land-use intensity and, in particular, declining traditional practices were the foremost mechanisms of the recent upper forest-cover upward shift, whereas the effect of climate warming remains not so obvious.

TI  - On the Use of Dual Co-Polarized Radar Data to Derive a Sea Surface Doppler Model-Part 1: Approach
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a Doppler velocity (DV) model based on dual co-polarized (co-pol) decomposition of a normalized radar cross section of an ocean surface on polarized Bragg scattering and nonpolarized (NP) radar returns from breaking wave components. The dual co-pol decomposition provides a quantitative description of resonant and NP scattering, as well as their dependence on the incident angle, azimuth, and wind speed. Subsequently, the contributions of the facet (resonant Bragg waves and breakers) velocities, tilt, and hydrodynamic modulations due to long waves to the resulting DV can be quantified. The tilt modulation contributions to DV are estimated using the measured/empirical tilt modulation transfer function (MTF). The hydrodynamic modulations are mostly dominated by wave breaking and are estimated using a semiempirical model based on in situ measurements. In addition to the VV and HH radar data, which are required for dual co-pol decomposition and tilt MTF estimates, the surface wave spectrum is required in the DV determination for a given radar observation geometry. In this article, qualitative and quantitative consistencies are presented between the model simulations and the empirical CDOP model. In a companion paper, a DV analysis is presented to analyze the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar measurements and collocated in situ measurements of surface wind and wave spectra.

T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sentinel lymph node biopsy refers to an innovative and minimalist surgical approach that has been introduced to reduce both complications and morbidity. A de-finitive answer to the question of whether lymph-adenectomy is performed for staging or curative purposes in endometrial cancer has not yet been found. The aim of this study is to compare patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy with indocyanine green and those who under-went laparoscopic complete surgical staging in terms of survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 182 patients was included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the lymph node sample type. The two groups were compared in terms of oncological outcomes.RESULTS: 92 patients underwent sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM cohort) and 90 patients underwent extensive pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy (SCL cohort). Considering only patients with negative lymph nodes, the Sentinel cohort was associated with a reduced DFS and OS (p=0.008 and p=0.005, respectively). This dif-ference may be due to the longer follow-up times of patients with comprehensive lymph node sam-pling. On the other hand, There was no difference in survival in lymph node positive cases.CONCLUSIONS: Sentinel lymph node dissection has no negative effect on survival in lymph node positive patients.

T2  - Hospital topics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine average length of stay (ALOS) for selected surgical procedures for CABG, TKR, THR and inguinal hernia and to compare the variation of ALOS among the group and its comparison with standard guidelines. Passive file auditing method was followed to collect the required information to calculate the pre-operative, post- operative and overall LOS for a period of two months. Additional data was collected from electronic health record system used by the hospital. The observed value for ALOS for CABG was 12.76days, for TKR - 6.44days, THR-7.6days and for inguinal hernia, it came to 2.28days. Further, the mean and standard deviation with respect to pre-operative and post-operative stay for the four surgical procedures revealed mean pre-operative stay for CABG was 3.96days, TKR - 1.18days, THR- 1.60days and Inguinal hernia was 0.53days. The post-operative mean stay for CABG, TKR, THR and inguinal hernia were 8.80days, 4.98days, 6days and 1.77days respectively. It was also observed that there was difference in terms of length of stay (LOS) when compared between male and female patients for different surgical procedures. The findings help in identifying the factors leading to increased LOS number of cases with pre-operative, post-operative or overall stay from entry to exit. It has given an insight on the gaps that needs to address to improve the efficiency of patient services offered by the tertiary care hospital.

TI  - Application of Hybrid-Pol SAR in Oil-Spill Detection
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the application of oil-spill monitoring, the satellite revisit time needs to be as short as possible to identify minor spills before they can cause widespread damage. Simultaneously, it is required to capture a sufficient amount of information about the surface to clearly distinguish between oil-spilled and oil-free sea regions. The hybrid-polarimetry (hybrid-pol) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system can be exploited for such capabilities. However, limited hybrid-pol-based oil-spill descriptors are reported in the literature in comparison with rich sets of full-polarimetry (full-pol)-based descriptors. In this letter, we establish a direct relation between hybrid-pol data and full-pol data under reflection-symmetry condition. Consequently, through the proposed work, the rich sets of full-pol-based oil-spill descriptors can be derived directly from the hybrid-pol datasets. For the validation of the proposed work, L-band ALOS PALSAR and UAVSAR datasets acquired over the Gulf of Mexico have been used.

AB  - We investigated the external magnetic potential due to solar forcing, with nine years of data during 2001-2009, covering the deep solar minimum (2006-2009), at two stations: one is in the polar cap-Vostok (78 degrees 27'S, 106 degrees 52'E; mag. lat 83 degrees S) and another is in the subauroral region -Maitri (70 degrees 45'S, 11 degrees 43'E: mag. lat 67 degrees S) in Antarctica. The significance of the work is associated with space weather prediction and its impact on planet Earth. We used Advance Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite data for the aforesaid period for a thorough understanding of influences due to solar wind origin and to compare the parameter observed in these regions. We used the spherical cap harmonic analysis (SCHA) function as a tool. The inference indicates that at Vostok the magnitude is enhanced throughout and depicts a broad ambient external magnetic potential. It seems to be essentially the intensification of the region 1 currents whereas at Maitri intense electric fields are produced during geomagnetic perturbations which drive a system of disturbed time Region 2 currents over the quiet time currents. During this scenario in Maitri there are noticeable peaks or enhancements in the magnetic potential that can be observed mainly during geomagnetic disturbances. Hence the regression relation developed for external magnetic potential calculation, in terms of solar wind parameters agrees well with polar cap region and the area is relatively less explored earlier, the present investigation can be expected to add knowledge about that regime.

AB  - In this paper, there are four distinct models utilized for the retrieval of C-SPM from the Sentinel 2A/2B satellite imageries by using cloud computing techniques. In this study, a comparative analysis of different C-SPM models was carried out at three different sites (Haridwar, Varanasi, and Hooghly). The study reveals that there are significant changes in C-SPM in the Ganges in three different periods such as pre, during, and post-COVID. Noteworthy, fewer anthropogenic activities have generated important transformations in aquatic environments during the COVID.

AB  - With the time, the need for spectrum usage or the bandwidth, among users of satellite communication has increased which resulted in the development of payload in higher frequency band (Ka, Q&V band).Further the need for higher output power from the satellite for mobile internet users also arises. To facilitate these requirements into the satellite, payload with spot beam coverage has been designed. This type of the satellite which provides higher throughput of data are known as High throughput satellite. Before handing over of the payload/transponder to users, comprehensive In-orbit testing (IOT) of the payload is carried out to verify its performance after withstanding vibration and thrust by launch vehicle. This paper presents IOT setup validation and measurement philosophy for in-orbit testing of payload of trending High throughput spot beam satellite.

TI  - Augmenting progress on the elimination of vertical transmissions of HIV in India: Insights from Spectrum-based HIV burden estimations.
T2  - PLOS global public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The government of India has adopted the elimination of vertical transmission of HIV as one of the five high-level goals under phase V of the National AIDS and STD Control Programme (NACP). In this paper, we present the data from HIV estimations 2021 for India and select States detailing the progress as well as the attributable causes for vertical transmissions. The NACP spearheads work on mathematical modelling to estimate HIV burden based on the periodically conducted sentinel surveillance for guiding program implementation and policymaking. Using the results of the latest round of HIV Estimations in 2021, we analysed the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) during the perinatal and postnatal (breastfeeding) period. In 2021, overall, around 5,000 [3,000-7,800] vertical transmissions were estimated nationally with 58% being perinatal infections and remaining during breastfeeding. MTCT at 6 weeks was around 12.95% [9.45-16.02] with the final transmission rate at 24.25% [18.50-29.50]. Overall, 57% of vertical transmissions were among HIV-positive mothers who did not receive ART during pregnancy or breastfeeding, 19% among mothers who dropped off ART during pregnancy or delivery, and 18% among mothers who were infected during pregnancy or breastfeeding. There were significant variations between States. Depending upon the States, the programme needs to focus on the intervention domains of timely engagement in antenatal care-HIV testing-ART initiation as well as programme retention and adherence support. Equally important would be strengthening the strategic information to generate related evidence for inputting India and State-specific parameters improving the MTCT-related modelled estimates.

T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this article is to perform the turning operation on an EN36B steel work-billet with a tungsten carbide tool, to study the optimal cutting parameters and carry out an analysis of flank-wear. Experimental and simulation-based research methodology was opted in this study. Experimental results were obtained from the lab setup, and optimisation of parameters was performed using RSM (response surface methodology). Using RSM, cutting-tool flank-wear was optimised, and the cutting parameters which affect the flank wear were determined. In results main effect plot, contour plot, the surface plot for flank-wear and forces (Fx, Fy and Fz) were successfully obtained. It was concluded that tool flank-wear is affected by depth of cut, and that flank-wear generally increases linearly with increasing cutting-speed, depth of cut and feed-rate. To validate the obtained results, predicated and measured values were plotted and were in very close agreement, having an accuracy level of 96.33% to 98.92%.

TI  - STUDY ON EUTROPHICATION CHANGE AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES IN PALIASTOMI LAKE
T2  - PERIODICO TCHE QUIMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The article describes the study of chlorophyll concentration dynamics in Paliastom lake and its surrounding area. The research covers the period from 2015 to 2022. The study uses remote sensing satellite images obtained from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, as a result of processing in the SNAP application. At the same time, in situ researches was performed. Aims: This study aims to research chlorophyll concentration in Paliastom lake and its adjacent area through remote sensing methods and in situ data. Methods: For our research and historical data collection, satellite remote sensing was applied, which generates data on spatial and temporal variations of suspended particles in estuaries and coastlines. In situ studies, Chlorophyll concentration and promoting chemical agents were measured, water temperature, pH, total hardness, alkalinity, acidity, and others. Total turbidity was determined, and qualitative reactions were performed to define the presence of phosphates and nitrates. Results: The results received through remote sensing, and in situ studies were compared. Paliastom lake and its adjacent area are prone to eutrophication processes. Natural phenomena and human industrial activity cause the process. Discussion: According to in situ studies and the data obtained from sensors, the water in Paliastom lake is prone to a weak alkaline reaction. The water of the lake can be considered as having medium turbidity. Phosphate and nitrate ion detection reactions performed with qualitative analysis protocols showed positive samples. The intensity of the obtained color indicated their high concentration. Conclusions: The annual evolution of Chl-a in Paliastom lake reaches the maximum value in the summer months. Compared to previous years, a decrease in chlorophyll concentration was observed during the lockdown period of 2020 due to the Covid Pandemic.

TI  - The Impact of the Type and Spatial Resolution of a Source Image on the Effectiveness of Texture Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a study on the effectiveness of texture analysis of remote sensing imagery depending on the type and spatial resolution of the source image. The study used the following image types: near-infrared band, red band, first principal component, second principal component and normalized difference vegetation index images of pixel size from 2 m to 30 m, generated from a multispectral WorldView-2 image. The study evaluated the separability of the selected pairs of the following land cover classes: bare soil, low vegetation, coniferous forest, deciduous forest, water reservoirs, built-up areas. The tool used for texture analysis was granulometric analysis based on morphological operations-one of less popular methods which, however, as demonstrated by previous studies, shows high effectiveness in separating classes of different texture. The conducted study enabled researchers to evaluate the significance of image type and resolution for visibility of texture in the image and the possibility of using texture to differentiate between classes. The obtained results showed that there is no single, universal combination of conditions of texture analysis, which would be the best from the point of view of all classes. For most of the analyzed pairs of classes, the best results were obtained for the highest spatial resolution of the image (2-3 m), but the class of built-up areas stands out in this comparison-the best distinction was obtained with the average spatial resolution (10-15 m). Research has also shown that there is no single type of image that is universally the best basis for texture analysis. While for the majority of classes the image of the first principal component was the best, for the class of built-up areas it was the image of the red channel.

TI  - FAULT MAPPING BY DATA OF AEROSPACE SURVEYS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF MAIN PIPELINES (FOR EXAMPLE OF THE SECTION CHAYVO-DE-KASTRI PIPELINE)
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the research is caused by the need to identify the hazardous geological processes during the construction and operation of pipelines. The Russian Federation ranks second in the world in terms of the total length of main pipelines, where accidents sometimes occur as result of the negative impact of natural and man-made factors. The main hazardous geological processes affecting pipelines are displacements in zones of active faults in the earth's crust. Diagnostics of the presence of fault zones in the territory planned for the con-struction of linear structures makes it possible to identify potentialy dangerous areas that should be paid close attention, and to organize constant monitoring in places of possible movements of soil masses. Based on economic considerations, it is advisable to conduct re-search using Earth remote sensing data, and modern geoinformation products for data processing. Monitoring using remote sensing alows you to quickly assess the changing engineering and geological conditions in the areas where the pipeline is laid, as well as detect signs of the occurrence of natural processes that pose danger to infrastructure facilities. Monitoring of corridors of main pipeline routes must be car-ried out by alavailable means during construction and operation. The use of ArcGIS, QGIS and LEFA software in combination with geo-physical data provided by the Unified Geophysical Service of the Russian Academy of Sciences makes it possible to assess seismic activi-ty, its intensity and the nature of the relationship with faults. The main aim of the research is to identify and show on the map the most dangerous areas with active fault zones, that pose a potential threat of negative impact on the pipeline during operation. Objects: space images of the corridor of the main pipeline route to identify ruptures of a seismogenic nature, maps of earthquake epicen-ters previously identified near the pipeline route. Methods: interpretation of satelite images, methods of geoinformation modeling, mapping, statistical methods, methods of automated lin-eament analysis, methods for changing the resolution, size and visibility of images without loss of information quality, such as interpolation and aggregation methods, spatial analysis of the interdependence of fault zones and earthquakes, compilation of geoinformation. Results. The analysis of geological, geophysical and satelite information about the territory where the pipeline was laid was carried out in order to identify fault zones. Automated lineament analysis of images in different spectral ranges and with different spatial resolution made it possible to identify the most probable fault zones. The seismic activity of the study area was estimated on the basis of geophysical data. Potentially dangerous sections of the study area, along which the main pipeline is laid, are identified and presented on the map, character-ized by the presence of fault zones and increased seismic activity.

TI  - THE PROSOPOGRAPHIC PORTRAIT OF THE UKRAINIAN EDITOR IN FOREWORDS AND DEDICATIONS TO CHURCH BOOKS OF THE 17-18th CENTURIES
T2  - UKRAINSKYI ISTORYCHNYI ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this article is to show the heuristic potential of comparative analysis of forewords, dedications, and afterwords in Ukrainian old-printed church editions for portraying the image of the baroque editor. The research methodology is based on a prosopographic analysis of the personality of the Ukrainian editor, as reflected in the forewords, dedications, and afterwords of old-printed church books. The scientific novelty of the research lies in the innovative utilization of forewords, dedications, and afterwords to Ukrainian old-printed church editions as historical micro-sources of editor's personality exploration. This kind of source is regarded as a manifestation of a value system and pragmatic intentions that are common for the social group, connected with the work of Ukrainian printing houses of the early modern period. Conclusions. The prosopographic portrait of the Ukrainian church book of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century editor reveals in a complex of mutually exclusive characteristics. On the one hand, the baroque editor portrays himself as a spiritual leader who cares for the church community by performing tangible acts such as providing books, which are critical for the salvation of souls in the battle against sin. This edge of the editor's personality acknowledges God's help in all stages of book publishing and manifests a true belief in God's providence to take care of the book after its release. On the other hand, the editor of the church book reveals himself as a profit-seeker. This edge of the editor's personality is demonstrated by his readiness to use a powerful person's protection or, if relevant, his own social privileges to get financial advantages for the printing house. The image of a generous patron who supports the development of book printing is depicted in texts of dedications to church editions as an attempt to build up the fashion for financial support of church book printing, presenting it as a virtue worthy of a heavenly reward. The competitiveness of church book editors is evidenced by the discussions on the accuracy of translation and reliability of sources, which are seen in the forewords to particular editions of books for church ceremonies. Such a dualistic form of the editor's self-presentation reflects the typical worldview of the Ukrainian baroque connection of selfless service to God, with expectations not only for salvation in eternity but also for prosperity in the earthly life.

TI  - Rule Based First Principles Approach to Identify Safe/Unsafe Behavior of Two-Wheeler Drivers Under Mixed Traffic Conditions
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Driver behavior refers to the actions and decisions made by drivers while operating a vehicle, including factors such as speed, distraction, and following road rules, traffic signals, etc. These behavior can greatly impact road safety, and safe driving practices can help reduce the risk of accidents and promote efficient traffic flow. Therefore, analyzing the individual driving behavior and detecting aggressiveness is essential for enhancing traffic safety. In order to do identify safe/unsafe driving behavior, a rule-based first principles approach was developed to establish a relationship between the resultant acceleration (longitudinal & lateral) and speed. A total of five drivers were recruited to collect the naturalistic driving data using a set of GPS devices and laser sensors installed on an instrumented two-wheeler from a study stretch selected in the vicinity of city of Patna. The collected data include location details along with speed and accelerations. A detailed comparison was made between different drivers and identified safe and unsafe driving behavior using the tool developed. Further, different hot-spot locations were identified throughout the selected route where drivers are violating the threshold limits of accelerations at higher speeds, which is more than the posted speed limit.

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the research is to study the collective image of Europe (the West) as a form of manifestation of spatial and civilizational ideas in the historical works written by Panteleimon Kulish; tracing the specifics of civilizational identity of this scholar; elucidation of his ideas regarding the relationship between the historical images of Russia-Ukraine and Europe-West in Kulish's historical texts. The methodology of the reseacrh is based on mental mapping as a strategy of cognitive reproduction of geographical objects in scholars' imagination. The basic component of the used methodology is imagology as a method of studying one's own/another person's images. In the research there is used deconstruction of the semi-Orientalism as a specific way of recepting and describing Eastern Europe by representatives of the "Western" intellectual thought. The scientific novelty of the research consists in the fact that it is the first attempt at a special historiographical reflection of the image of Europe-West in the historical works of Panteleimon Kulish. The Conclusion. In the research there has been summarized the specificity of the Slavic civilizational identity's conceptualization in the historical works written by Panteleimon Kulish with his view of Europe (the West) as an "alien" civilizational space. It has been substantiated that the Germans were the main representatives of the collective image of the West for the scholar. The signs of Eurocentric worldview and the beginnings of a tolerant reception of Western attributes can be traced in his late historical texts, which was expressed in the recognition of Europe as a "civilized" and "cultural" environment and a positive interpretation of the European "enlightenment". It has been summarized that the worldview evolution of Panteleimon Kulish illustrates defining stage of civilizational identity genesis of the Ukrainian scholars of the 19th century - the beginning of the transition from the Slavic to European identity.

T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Lichens are sensitive to competition from vascular plants, intensive silviculture, pollution and reindeer and caribou grazing, and can therefore serve as indicators of environmental changes. Hyperspectral remote sensing data has been proved promising for estimation of plant diversity, but its potential for forest floor lichen cover estimation has not yet been studied. In this study, we investigated the use of hyperspectral data in estimating ground lichen cover in boreal forest stands in Finland. We acquired airborne and in situ hyperspectral data of lichen-covered forest plots, and applied multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis to estimate the fractional cover of ground lichens in these plots. Estimation of lichen cover based on in situ spectral data was very accurate (coefficient of determination (r2) 0.95, root mean square error (RMSE) 6.2). Estimation of lichen cover based on airborne data, on the other hand, was fairly good (r2 0.77, RMSE 11.7), but depended on the choice of spectral bands. When the hyperspectral data were resampled to the spectral resolution of Sentinel-2, slightly weaker results were obtained. Tree canopy cover near the flight plots was weakly related to the difference between estimated and measured lichen cover. The results also implied that the presence of dwarf shrubs could influence the lichen cover estimates.

TI  - Use of indocyanine green for sentinel lymph node biopsy in melanoma.
T2  - Proceedings (Baylor University. Medical Center)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for cutaneous melanoma is a critical part of designing therapy for the skin malignancy. A retrospective review of 54 patients with cutaneous melanoma who underwent SLN biopsy guided by both radiotracer injection and indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent dye compared the accuracy of identifying the SLN using each method. Patients were injected preoperatively with radiotracer at the site of the primary melanoma and intraoperatively with 2.5 mg of ICG. The detection of the SLN was compared between the two methods. Patients were followed to determine local recurrence and survival from 5 months to 4 years. ICG and radiotracer identified the SLN in 52 of 54 patients. In those patients who mapped, 52 of 52 showed mapping to the same node or nodes. The rate of cancer involvement in the identified node was 19.2% for both techniques. There was no difference in recurrence or survival between the two methods of SLN identification in short follow-up. In conclusion, ICG injection and mapping to identify SLN in cutaneous melanoma is confirmatory for radiotracer mapping and in the future may be an accurate and less costly method for SLN biopsy in cutaneous melanoma.

AB  - Climate change is becoming more and more serious leading to extreme weather events, such as drought, storm, flood, etc. occurring with increasing frequency and unpredictability. In Vietnam, recent historic flood events caused a lot of damage to property and life urgently requested a solution to rapidly map the flood area to help government respond promptly mitigating loss of life. However, floods usually occur when most of the sky is covered with clouds. In such weather condition, satellite radar imagery such as Copernicus Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is a valuable data source in flood mapping tasks. This study aims to design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method which isolates the flooded pixels in freely available Sentinel-1 imagery. The CNN architecture was obtained empirically by modifying the model based on visual inspection on the generated flood masks. The experimental results showed that the pre-trained CNN model provided similar results compared to conventional Google Earth Engine (GEE) based method but significantly reduced the time take to map the flood which allows it to be applied for real-time flood mapping.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Uterine Cancer: Time for a Modern Approach
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The sentinel lymph node biopsy technique is widely used in uterine cancers. Some new parameters as ultrastadification or molecular biology have modified our algorithms which are becoming more and more complex. We discuss here the integration of the sentinel node biopsy technique in the global strategy of management of uterine cancers. Since the validation of the sentinel node technique (SLN) for vulvar cancer 20 years ago, this technique has been introduced in the management of operable cervical cancer and endometrial cancer. For cervical cancer a "one fits all" attitude has mainly been presented. However, this approach, consisting of a frozen section during the operation, can be discussed in some stages. We present and discuss the main option for each stage, as well as some secondary possibilities. For endometrial cancer, SLN is now the technique of choice for the nodal staging of low- and intermediate-risk groups. Some discussion exists for the high-risk group. We also discuss the impacts of using preoperatively the molecular classification of endometrial cancer. Patients with POLE or TP53 mutations could have different nodal staging. The story of SLN in uterine cancers is not finished. We propose a comprehensive algorithm of SLN in early cervical and endometrial cancers. However, several ongoing trials will give us important data in the coming years. They could substantially change these propositions.

TI  - Lymph-vascular Space Involvement and/or p53 Overexpression Correlated With the Clinical Outcome of Early-stage Endometrial Cancer Patients Treated With Adjuvant Vaginal Brachytherapy
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: The majority of patients with endometrial cancer (EC) are diagnosed at an early stage and undergo primary surgery, followed by observation or adjuvant therapy according to risk factors on surgical samples. The objective of this study was to assess the correlation between a risk profile represented by the presence of substantial lymph -vascular space involvement (LVSI) and/or p53 overexpression and the clinical outcome of patients with early-stage endometrial cancer (EC) who received adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy (BT). Patients and Methods: This investigation assessed 79 patients who underwent hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic and/o aortic lymphadenectomy or sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by hypofractionated (HDR)-vaginal BT, using 192Ir source, for stage I-II endometrioid (n=70) or non-endometrioid (n=9) EC. Thirty-four patients (43.0%) were considered to have an unfavorable risk profile defined by the presence of substantial LVSI and /or p53 overexpression. Results: Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) and five-year overall survival (OS) were 93.7% and 95%, respectively. There was a significant correlation between unfavorable risk-profile and pelvic recurrence rate (p=0.002) and distant recurrence rate (p=0.017). Patients with abnormal p53 had a higher risk of local relapse (p=0.041). Substantial LVSI was strongly associated with pelvic recurrence (p=0.001) and distant metastasis (p<0.001). Conclusion: The presence of substantial LVSI and/or p53 overexpression strictly correlated with poor outcome of patients with early-stage EC and should be taken into consideration for better planning adjuvant treatment in this clinical setting.

TI  - Considerations for de-escalating universal masking in healthcare centers.
T2  - Antimicrobial stewardship & healthcare epidemiology : ASHE
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Three years after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, better knowledge on the transmission of respiratory viral infections (RVI) including the contribution of asymptomatic infections encouraged most healthcare centers to implement universal masking. The evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and improved immunization of the population call for the infection and prevention control community to revisit the masking strategy in healthcare. In this narrative review, we consider factors for de-escalating universal masking in healthcare centers, addressing compliance with the mask policy, local epidemiology, the level of protection provided by medical face masks, the consequences of absenteeism and presenteeism, as well as logistics, costs, and ecological impact. Most current national and international guidelines for mask use are based on the level of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Actions are now required to refine future recommendations, such as establishing a list of the most relevant RVI to consider, implement reliable local RVI surveillance, and define thresholds for activating masking strategies. Considering the epidemiological context (measured via sentinel networks or wastewater analysis), and, if not available, considering a time period (winter season) may guide to three gradual levels of masking: (i) standard and transmission-based precautions and respiratory etiquette, (ii) systematic face mask wearing when in direct contact with patients, and (iii) universal masking. Cost-effectiveness analysis of the different strategies is warranted in the coming years. Masking is just one element to be considered along with other preventive measures such as staff and patient immunization, and efficient ventilation.

TI  - A Machine Learning-Based Method for Downscaling All-Sky Downward Surface Shortwave Radiation Over Complex Terrain
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In regions with complex terrain, high-spatial-resolution downward surface shortwave radiation (DSSR) is critical for monitoring mountain ecological processes and for environmental management. However, currently available DSSR products are often too coarse (from a kilometer to tens of kilometers) to capture the spatial heterogeneity of DSSR in topographically complex regions. To address this issue, this study proposes a new downscaling method for all-sky instantaneous DSSR, employing a machine learning (ML) method, top-of-atmosphere reflectance, and topographic data. The method is used to downscale the 5-km Himawari-8 (H-8) DSSR product to the Sentinel 10 m scale. A region of Southwest China was chosen as a case study. Validated by field measurements from nine stations in 2020, the downscaled DSSR showed improvements in the mean bias error (MBE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 32.74%, 9.31%, and 6.34%, respectively, when compared with the original product. The downscaled DSSR can be generated in all-sky conditions. In general, this method successfully captures high-resolution DSSR over complex terrain and should be helpful for related studies.

AB  - PURPOSE: Our aim was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy-guided lymph node dissection compared to extended pelvic lymph node dissection in patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, single-arm, multicenter study at 3 tertiary centers in France between February 2012 and May 2019. Eligible patients had clinically localized intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer. After intraprostatic injection of (99m)Tc-nanocolloid, the locations of the sentinel lymph nodes were defined by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. Surgical excision of the sentinel lymph nodes was performed using intraoperative gamma probe guidance. After resection of the sentinel lymph nodes, extended pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in all patients. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the sentinel lymph node biopsy method using extended pelvic lymph node dissection as the reference standard. This trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02732392).RESULTS: A total of 162 men cN0M0 (CT scan and bone scan) were enrolled: 106 (65.4%) and 56 (34.6%) patients had intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer, respectively. The median number of nodes retrieved was 14 (mean 16, IQR 10-21) per patient. At final pathological analysis, 22 patients (13.6%) were pN+.

TI  - Status of Human Embryo in vitro as Ethical and Legal Issue: Religious Origins of Disagreements in Approaches
T2  - PRAVO-ZHURNAL VYSSHEI SHKOLY EKONOMIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The subject of this article is the question of ontological status of the human embryo in vitro, on whose decision the determination of its moral and legal status depends, which is of exceptional importance for the ethical and legal regulation of manipulations with embryos in the process of scholar research and in clinical practice of the reproductive technologies. Various approaches to solve the problem of the embryo status historically developed in different countries and regions of the world the author considers from the standpoint of Christian anthropology. The thesis is substantiated that the idea of human likeness to God, formed in Christian culture, which gave a powerful impetus to scientific and technological progress, initially contained deep ideological prerequisites that could block the possibility of the most dangerous intrusions into the human nature, created in the image of God. One of these premises is the idea that the human embryo from the moment of its conception is a spiritualized person. This intention contained in the depths of the Christian worldview, to recognize the human embryo as a person was actualized in the last decades of the 20th century under influence of the legalization of abortion and the possibility of development of the embryo in the laboratory, its cryopreservation, manipulation of its genes to the prospect of genetic improvement of the future child. As a result, countries whose cultural matrix does not contain such moral and religious constraints, in the context of the development of the scholar and technological sphere, receive advantages in global competition that in a certain sense also has a civilizational character. This circumstance has become one of the factors contributing to the emerging changes in international ethical and legal regulation, defining the boundaries of genetic research on human embryonic development. The main vector of changes is set by the weakening of the previous restrictions, the origins of which go back to the dogmas of Christianity. Moreover, the latest innovations in this area demonstrate the desire of the biomedical community to share responsibility for the development of regulatory policy in the field of human embryo research with researchers of other branches of science and with the public.

TI  - Distribution of Optical and Hydrological Characteristics in the Antarctic Sound Based on the Measurements in January, 2022 in the 87th cruise of the R/V "Akademik Mstislav Keldysh"
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the work is to study the different-scale features of distribution of the hydrooptical and hydrological characteristics in the Antarctic Sound based on the contact and satellite measurements carried out in January, 2022 in the 87th cruise of the R/V "Akademik Mstislav Keldysh". Methods and Results. The data of complex natural measurements performed at the oceanographic stations in the Antarctic Sound on January 27-28, 2022 in the 87th cruise of the R/V "Akademik Mstislav Keldysh" were used. Additionally, the satellite data were analyzed. Complex hydrophysical equipment permitted to obtain the vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a concentration, fluorescence intensity of colored dissolved organic matter, intensity of the beam attenuation coefficient at 660 nm and photosynthetically active radiation. Based on these data, the main features of mesoscale circulation within the cyclonic gyre over the deep-sea part in the southern Antarctic Sound were determined. The joint analysis of hydrooptical and hydrological characteristics, and satellite measurements in the Antarctic Sound obtained in course of the Antarctic expedition showed presence of a system of the alternating anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies in the area under study. It is also shown that in the ice drift area polluted by land soils or shelf bottom sediments, a zone of the increased turbidity arises that is related to the terrigenous suspension entering into the water during ice melting. Conclusions. The system of the different-scales eddies and currents in the Antarctic Sound contributes to the water exchange between the upper and deep layers of the strait, as well as between the Weddell Sea water spreading to the north-northwest along the slope of the strait basin adjacent to the shelf edge of the Antarctic Peninsula and the Bransfield Straight waters spreading along the slope of the islands' shelf which is the northeastern boundary of the strait.

TI  - Beyond Ageism: A Qualitative Study of Intersecting Forms of Prejudice towards Retired Older People
T2  - SOCIETIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Negative stereotypes of older people can have detrimental impacts on their mental health, hence better understanding of ageism is needed to combat ageism more effectively. Nevertheless, existing studies on ageism largely focus on the workplace, while relatively less is known about younger people's generalizations of older people in everyday neighbourhood contexts. This study investigated young adults' stereotypes of retired older people in the context of high-density residential neighbourhoods in Hong Kong, through 23 qualitative in-depth interviews. The findings counter the misconception that ageism is less prevalent in Asian societies, while uncovering young adults' novel interpretations of traditional cultural norms of respect towards older people. The findings also reveal more complex intersections between ageism, classism, and prejudice towards worldview-dissimilar older people. These findings suggest the need to broaden the scope of ageism-reduction interventions, to tackle not only age-related prejudice but other forms of prejudice. Paying closer attention to intersectional forms of prejudice can also facilitate the design of more inclusive intergenerational programs and intergenerational public spaces, both locally and internationally.

TI  - Cloud Climatologies from Global Climate Models-A Comparison of CMIP5 and CMIP6 Models with Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulating clouds with global climate models is challenging as the relevant physics involves many nonlinear processes covering a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. As key components of the hydrological cycle and the cli-mate system, an evaluation of clouds from models used for climate projections is an important prerequisite for assessing the confidence in the results from these models. Here, we compare output from models contributing to phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) with satellite data and with results from their predecessors (CMIP5). We use multiproduct reference datasets to estimate the observational uncertainties associated with different sensors and with internal variability on a per-pixel basis. Selected cloud properties are also analyzed by region and by dynamical regime and thermodynamic conditions. Our results show that for parameters such as total cloud cover, cloud water path, and cloud radiative effect, the CMIP6 multimodel mean performs slightly better than the CMIP5 ensemble mean in terms of mean bias, pattern correlation, and relative root-mean square deviation. The intermodel spread in CMIP6, however, is not re-duced compared to CMIP5. Compared with CALIPSO-ICECLOUD data, the CMIP5/6 models overestimate cloud ice, particularly in the lower and middle troposphere, partly due to too high ice fractions for given temperatures. This bias is re-duced in the CMIP6 multimodel mean. While many known biases such as an underestimation in cloud cover in stratocumu-lus regions remain in CMIP6, we find that the CMIP5 problem of too few but too reflective clouds over the Southern Ocean is significantly improved.

TI  - Model-Based Retrieval of Forest Parameters From Sentinel-1 Coherence and Backscatter Time Series
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter describes a model-based algorithm for estimating tree height and other bio-physical land parameters from time series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric coherence and backscatter supported by sparse lidar data. The random-motion-over-ground model (RMoG) is extended to time series and revisited to capture the short- and long-term temporal coherence variability caused by motion of the scatterers and changes in the soil and canopy backscatter. The proposed retrieval algorithm estimates first the spatially slow-varying RMoG model parameters using sparse lidar data, and subsequently the spatially fast-varying model parameters such as tree height. The recently published global Sentinel-1 (S-1) interferometric coherence and backscatter data set and sparse spaceborne GEDI lidar data are used to illustrate the algorithm. Results obtained for a small region over Spain show that the temporal coherence and backscatter time series have the potential to be used for global, model-based land parameter estimation.

TI  - Tunicate Swarm Algorithm with Deep Learning Based Land Use and Cover Change Detection in Nallamalla Forest India
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Every biological system on the planet is severely impacted by environmental change, and its primary driver is deforestation. Meanwhile, quantitative analysis of changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) is one of the prominent ways to manage and understand land transformation; thus, it is essential to inspect the performance of various techniques for LULC mapping to recognize the better classifier to more applications of earth observation. This article develops a Tunicate Swarm Algorithm with Deep Learning Enabled Land Use and Land Cover Change Detection (TSADL-LULCCD) technique in Nallamalla Forest, India. The presented TSADL-LULCCD technique mainly focuses on the identification and classification of land use in the Nallamalla forest using LANDSAT images. To accomplish this, the presented TSADL-LULCCD technique employs a dense EfficientNet model for feature extraction. In addition, the Adam optimizer is applied for the optimal hyper parameter tuning of the dense EfficientNet approach. For land cover classification, the TSADL-LULCCD technique exploits the Deep Belief Network (DBN) approach. To tune the hyper parameters related to the DBN system, the TSA is used. The experimental validation of the TSADL-LULCCD algorithm is tested on LANDSAT-7-based Nallamalla region images. The experimental results stated that the TSADL-LULCCD technique exhibits better performance over other existing models in terms of different evaluation measures.

TI  - Performance evaluation of image fusion techniques and implementation of new fusion technique for remote sensing satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The technique of integrating images from two or more sensors that were taken from the same place or the same object is known as image fusion. The goal is to get more spectral and spatial information from the combined image as a whole than from the individual images. It is required to fuse the images in order to improve the spatial and spectral quality of both panchromatic and multispectral images. This study introduces a novel method for fusing remote sensing images that combines L0 smoothing, NSCT (Non-subsampled Contourlet Transform), SR (Sparse Representation), and MAR (Max absolute rule). The multispectral and panchromatic images are initially divided into lower and higher frequency components using the L0 smoothing filter as the method of fusion. The fusion process is then carried out, utilising a technique that combines NSCT and SR to fuse low-frequency components. Similar to this, the Max-absolute fusion rule is used to fuse high-frequency components. In conclusion, the disintegration of fused low-frequency and high-frequency data yields the final image. Our method yields an enhanced outcome in terms of the correlation coefficient, Entropy, spatial frequency, and fusion of mutual information for both the term of picture quality enhancement and visual evaluation. This suggested approach produces superior outcomes after execution. This study makes use of the Landsat-7ETM+, IKONOS, and Quick Bird datasets. Different satellites are used to take each image. There have been two examples of each image used. In comparison to previous Traditional Methods, the proposed image fusion techniques' output has a quality that is more than 20% higher.

TI  - Developing Sentinel Surveillance for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Using Test Results From Routine Screening During Pregnancy
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Interpretation of case-based surveillance of chlamydia and gonorrhea is limited by the lack of negative tests for comparison. We sought to develop a sustainable electronic health record (EHR)-based approach to disease surveillance in a sentinel population of pregnant persons.Methods: We conducted a 1-year assessment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in persons receiving at least 1 pregnancy-related visit within our university medical center. Data were obtained using EHR analytic structured query language code. Patients were categorized by whether they had an STI test during pregnancy and if screened, by the STI test results (positive or negative). We assessed screening and positivity by demographic using bivariate analyses. Predictors of a positive STI test were determined using logistic regression.Results: We identified 4553 persons who received pregnancy care from January 1 to December 31, 2021. Seventy-six percent (n = 3483) of persons were screened for an STI during pregnancy. Those who identified as white or had private insurance were less likely to have a chlamydia test. Among persons screened, Trichomonas was the most commonly detected STI (5%, 141/2698) followed by chlamydia (4%, 135/3456), and gonorrhea (0.7% 24/3468). Predictors of a positive STI test during pregnancy were Black race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.0; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.2-8.7), 25 years or younger (aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.9-3.3), and public insurance (aOR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1).Conclusions: We demonstrated that EHRs can be used to assess gonorrhea and chlamydia positivity. These methods could potentially be applied in other jurisdictions to improve the understanding of national STI surveillance.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Particulate Organic Carbon on the Western Antarctic Peninsula Shelf Using a Color Index-Based Algorithm
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A color index (CI)-based algorithm (CIPOC) for estimating particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations from satellite observations is evaluated for the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) shelf. The CI utilizes three spectral bands centered approximately at 490, 550, and 670 nm of the ocean color satellite sensors. The CIPOC algorithm is calibrated and validated using field-measured POC concentration data and match-up satellite-derived remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) data. For comparison, the performance of the blue-green (BG) band ratio algorithm is also evaluated using the same match-up dataset. Results show that the CIPOC algorithm outperforms the BG band ratio algorithm in determining the POC concentration for the WAP shelf with good statistical parameters of algorithm performance for the CIPOC algorithm. Given that the CIPOC algorithm is built upon a three-band-difference concept and is less sensitive to artificial errors in R-rs than the BG algorithm, CIPOC can correct POC concentration by retrieving uncertainties caused by sea ice and cloud contaminations. Further evaluation showed that the CIPOC algorithm can derive POC from the next-generation ocean color satellite sensors with robust performance and noise tolerance.

TI  - Crop Response to Disease and Water Scarcity Quantified by Normalized Difference Latent Heat Index
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Early detection and quantification of plants' response to disease and water shortage conditions are very important for the agricultural management. This study represents the first utilization of Normalized Difference Latent Heat Index (NDLI) as a dimensionless indicator to assess plant health. By integrating NDLI with thermal infrared and surface energy balance (SEB) components, we aim to enhance the analysis of crop conditions and water scarcity in rice-growing areas. The integration between NDLI and land surface temperature exhibits a strong correlation (r = -0.82) with crop evapotranspiration (ET) derived from the widely used residual Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model. Besides, the performance of NDLI- and SEB-based ET method proved its ability to provide the precise information of paddy field conditions by showing the significant correlations with the crop canopy biophysical properties that are traditionally represented and inferred by the multispectral remote sensing indices. The correlation coefficients of NDLI- and SEB-derived ET with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalize Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Optimization of the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) were 0.84, 0.55, and 0.84, respectively. Also, NDLI- and SEB-derived ET exhibits a high degree of consistency with the ET determined through the SEBAL method, with difference less than 10% of the observations over 98.1% of the paddy fields of concern. Interestingly, the abnormally low ET signatures over the confirmed disease-infected regions of paddy fields are obviously observed in the NDLI- and SEB-derived ET maps, but not in the SEBAL-derived ET map. The findings of this work suggest that NDLI can be considered as a valuable indicator to provide information of the water stress status and health of the crop plants for advanced food-supply management.

AB  - A new 3D focal control system composed of arrayed optofluidic prisms is presented. Through dynamic control of the fluid-fluid interface via electrowetting, incoming rays are spatially steered to achieve 3D focal control. Analytical study identifies the prism angle required to obtain a focal point at P-focal = (f(x), f(y), f(z)) located in 3D space. Experimentally, an arrayed system has demonstrated its 3D focal tunability along 0 <= f(x) <== 30, 0 <= f(y) <= 30, and 500 <= f(z) <= infinity in millimeters. This new lens capability for 3D focal control can be potentially used for tracking eye movement for smart displays, or solar tracking for smart compact concentrated photovoltaic systems.

TI  - Vegetation Classification in Urban Areas by Combining UAV-Based NDVI and Thermal Infrared Image
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation has become very important decision-making information in promoting tasks such as urban regeneration, urban planning, environment, and landscaping. In the past, the vegetation index was calculated by combining images of various wavelength regions mainly acquired from the Landsat satellite's TM or ETM+ sensor. Recently, a technology using UAV-based multispectral images has been developed to obtain more rapid and precise vegetation information. NDVI is a method of calculating the vegetation index by combining the red and near-infrared bands, and is currently the most widely used. In this study, NDVI was calculated using UAV-based multispectral images to classify vegetation. However, among the areas analyzed using NDVI, there was a problem that areas coated with urethane, such as basketball courts and waterproof coating roofs, were classified as vegetation areas. In order to examine these problems, the reflectance of each land cover was investigated using the ASD FieldSpec4 spectrometer. As a result of analyzing the spectrometer measurements, the NDVI values of basketball courts and waterproof coating roofs were similar to those of grass with slightly lower vegetation. To solve this problem, the temperature characteristics of the target site were analyzed using UAV-based thermal infrared images, and vegetation area was analyzed by combining the temperature information with NDVI. To evaluate the accuracy of the vegetation classification technology, 4409 verification points were selected, and kappa coefficients were analyzed for the method using only NDVI and the method using NDVI and thermal infrared images. Compared to the kappa coefficient of 0.830, which was analyzed by applying only NDVI, the kappa coefficient, which was analyzed by combining NDVI and thermal infrared images, was 0.934, which was higher. Therefore, it is very effective to apply a technology that classifies vegetation by combining NDVI and thermal infrared images in urban areas with many urethane-coated land cover such as basketball courts or waterproof coating roofs.

AB  - # TRiVIAToolbox for River Velocimetry using Images from Aircraft: TRiVIA## DescriptionThe Toolbox for River Velocimetry using Images from Aircraft, or TRiVIA for short, is an application to facilitate estimation of surface flow velocities in river channels from various types of remotely sensed data acquired with a nadir-viewing geometry (i.e., looking straight down). Spatially distributed information on flow speed is derived using a computational method known as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). TRiVIA provides an integrated workflow for video/image import and subsetting, image stabilization, geo-referencing, region of interest definition, image pre-processing, PIV, accuracy assessment relative to field measurements, and export of results.## InstallationTo begin using TRiVIA, download the file [TRiVIA.zip](https://code.usgs.gov/wma/osd/trivia/-/blob/main/TRiVIA.zip) from the root directory of the main branch on this repository.  The zip archive contains the current version of the TRiVIA installer and a tutorial illustrating how to use the software. Note that although TRiVIA does not require that the end user have a MATLAB license, the free MATLAB Component Runtime (MCR) must be installed locally and is included in the installer in TRiVIA.zip. To install both MCR and the TRiVIA app itself, unzip TRiVIA.zip and run the installer file.## UsageFor an example application of TRiVIA that illustrates how to use the software using data sets freely available through the USGS ScienceBase catalog, please refer to the tutorial document that is included in the zip archive and also available in the doc folder of this repository: [TRiVIA_TutorialV1.6.pdf](https://code.usgs.gov/wma/osd/trivia/-/blob/main/doc/TRiVIA_TutorialV1.6.pdf).The code folder in this repository contains the MATLAB source code used to develop TRiVIA.  The software was produced using MATLAB's App Designer and the main file TRiVIAv15.mlapp contains the code behind the graphical user interface. Additional helper functions called by the app are also available as *.m files in various subfolders of the code folder. ## SupportThe doc folder in this repository includes a tutorial that explains how to use TRiVIA for two typical use cases: [TRiVIA_TutorialV1.6.pdf](https://code.usgs.gov/wma/osd/trivia/-/blob/main/doc/TRiVIA_TutorialV1.6.pdf).For technical questions or issues regarding TRiVIA, please contact the developers at [TRiVIAinfo@usgs.gov](mailto:TRiVIAinfo@usgs.gov).## RoadmapThis initial release of TRiVIA focuses on estimating surface flow velocities from nadir-viewing image time series. Possibilities for future enhancement of the software include allowing for bathymetric input so that river discharge can be calculated, adding export formats suitable with visualization packages such as Tableau, and improving the geo-referencing module.## ContributingIf you have additional feature requests or would like to collaborate to improve TRiVIA, please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://code.usgs.gov/wma/osd/trivia/-/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) contact  the primary developer, Carl J.

TI  - Immunogenetic Predisposition to SARS-CoV-2 Infection
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020, numerous data with respect to the influence of immunogenetics on the predisposition to and severity of infection have been reported worldwide (PubMed; n = 228; 6 November 2022). Immunogenetics play a pivotal role in infection, vaccination, its failures, and/or vaccination breakthrough. Factors including the major histocompatibility complex and the common ABO blood group system have been discussed. Herein, we describe the association of HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, DRB345, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, DPB1, and HLA-E, F, G, and H on the results of molecular detection of COVID-19, or, in some cases, on antibody detection upon first testing. Furthermore, we molecularly defined 22 blood group systems comprising 26 genes and 5 platelet antigen genes. Herein, 37% tested COVID-19 negative while 63% tested positive by PCR. Within the negative subjects, HLA-B*57:01, HLA-B*55:01, DRB1*13:01, and DRB1*01:01, were enriched, and in the positive group, homozygosity for DQA/DQB, DRB1*09:01, and DRB1*15:01 was observed. For HLA-DQA1, we observed an enrichment for DQA1*01:01, DQA1*02:01, and DQA1*01:03. For HLA-DQB1, we found that HLA-DQB1*06:02 was enriched in the positive group, while HLA-DQB1*05:01 and HLA-DQB1*06:03 were enriched in the negative group. The homozygous platelet antigen HPA-1a was significantly enriched in the negative group, contrasting with the HPA-1ab, which was enriched in the COVID-19 infected group. Herein, we included 527 individuals from two Hospitals, Chemnitz and University-Hospital Leipzig. In total, 199 were negative for PCR and 328 were positive upon first admission. We used next generation sequencing for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, DRB345, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, and DPB1, and in some cases, HLA-E, F, G, and H. Furthermore, we molecularly defined 22 blood group systems comprising 26 genes and 5 platelet antigen genes. We observed a significant enrichment of homozygosity for DQA/DQB in the positive group. Within the negative subjects, HLA-B*57:01, HLA-B*55:01, DRB1*13:01, and DRB1*01:01 were enriched, and in the positive group, homozygosity for DQA/DQB, DRB1*09:01, and DRB1*15:01 was observed. DQA1*01:01, DQA1*02:01, and DQA1*01:03 were enriched in the negative group. HLA-DQB1*06:02 was enriched in the positive group, and HLA-DQB1*05:01 and HLA-DQB1*06:03 were enriched in the negative group. For the blood group systems MNS, RH, LE, FY, JK, YT, DO, and KN, enrichment was seen in both groups, depending on the antigen under observation. Homozygosity for D-positive RHD alleles, as well as the phenotypes M-N+ of the MNS blood group system and Yk(a-) of the KN system, were enriched in the positive group. All of these significances disappeared upon correction. Subjects who carried homozygous HPA-1a were more frequent in the negative group, contrasting with the finding that HPA-1ab was enriched in the positive group.

TI  - Estimation and Mapping of Aboveground Vegetation Water Storage in Jiuzhaigou Nature Reserve Using Sentinel Imagery
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to scientifically evaluate water resource reserves and the regulation mechanisms of vegetation in a hydrological cycle, it is necessary to improve the inversion accuracy of aboveground vegetation water storage (AVWS). To calculate more accurate AVWS, Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery were used to map the AVWS of the Jiuzhaigou Nature Reserve. Predictors extracted from S1 and S2 imagery were divided into three modelling groups: S1 data (S1G), S2A data (S2G) and S12G data (combining S1G and S2G). The best linear model (LM) and Random Forest (RF) regression model of AVWS were established by predictors of the three groups; finally, RF regression models based on S2G (10-fold cross-validation determination coefficients [R2] = 0.67, relative root mean square error [rRMSE] = 13.78 %) and S12G (R2 = 0.72, rRMSE = 11.94 %) were selected for mapping AVWS in the study area. The results show that the aboveground vegetation water storage (AVWS) of the study area could be effectively estimated and mapped based on synergistic predictors derived from S1 and S2, as well as S12G predictors (cooperating with S1G and S2G).

TI  - A survey of Stomoxys Geoffroy, 1762 (Diptera: Muscidae) in eight administrative regions of Cameroon
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENTOMOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Stomoxys Geoffroy, 1762 are major livestock pests in the tropics and are common in diverse habitats. This study aims to conduct a survey on the Stomoxys fauna of Cameroon. From 2015 to 2017, entomological studies using standard traps (n=204) were conducted in eight administrative regions found in five agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Cameroon with 606 trap-points over 22,032 traps days. A total of 77,804 Stomoxys specimens were collected, with eight taxa consisting of six species (S. calcitrans (Linnaeus, 1758), S. omega Newstead, Dutton & Todd, 1907, S. xanthomelas Roubaud, 1937, S. inornatus Grunberg, 1906, S. transvittatus Villeneuve, 1916, and S. sitiens (Rondani, 1873)) and two subspecies (Stomoxys niger niger Macquart, 1851 and S. niger bilineatus Grunberg, 1906) identified. Among all the recorded taxa, S. calcitrans and S. n. niger were present in five and seven of the eight regions respectively, but S. sitiens was rare and only found in the North. Furthermore, the highest species number (seven out of eight) was recorded in the Guinee savanna of the Adamawa region. The highest apparent density range of 101 to 200 Stomoxys/ trap/ day (s/t/d) was recorded in the Sudan savanna AEZ of the Far North region. Stomoxys occurred in all the AEZs in eight regions, some of which are major cattle rearing regions. This represents risk for the mechanically transmission of dangerous pathogens in those regions.

AB  - Structural Health Monitoring for a real understanding of the changes taking place and their effects on the structural integrity of the built environment, sometimes it is necessary to move to long observation times. This follows the axioms of SHM, which identify a certain relationship between the frequency and time of observation and the extent (and therefore severity) of ongoing damage. For this reason, in the present paper, interferometric displacement satellite data acquired for a decade on the territory of the city of Rome (Italy) are investigated and correlated to natural phenomena. The paper critically analyzes the possibility of a relationship between these phenomena and satellite data in order to bring out a common pattern. The study of natural and anthropogenic phenomena in the same frequency bandwidth as the interferometric satellite data would therefore be useful for recognizing potential triggering causes of higher frequency phenomena, which could appear as sudden and unstable phenomena if observed with shorter times. In the paper, the authors first make a comparison between natural phenomena and satellite data on a territorial scale and then focus on a series of isolated case studies (single structures and infrastructures).

TI  - Organ-oriented proteogenomics functional atlas of three aquatic invertebrate sentinel species.
T2  - Scientific data
M3  - Dataset
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Proteogenomic methodologies have enabled the identification of protein sequences in wild species without annotated genomes, shedding light on molecular mechanisms affected by pollution. However, proteomic resources for sentinel species are limited, and organ-level investigations are necessary to expand our understanding of their molecular biology. This study presents proteomic resources obtained from proteogenomic analyses of key organs (hepatopancreas, gills, hemolymph) from three established aquatic sentinel invertebrate species of interest in ecotoxicological/ecological research and environmental monitoring: Gammarus fossarum, Dreissena polymorpha, and Palaemon serratus. Proteogenomic analyses identified thousands of proteins for each species, with over 90% of them being annotated to putative function. Functional analysis validated the relevance of the proteomic atlases by revealing similarities in functional annotation of catalogues of proteins across analogous organs in the three species, while deep contrasts between functional profiles are delimited across different organs in the same organism. These organ-level proteomic atlases are crucial for future research on these sentinel animals, aiding in the evaluation of aquatic environmental risks and providing a valuable resource for ecotoxicological studies.

TI  - The scientific character of psychoanalysis: Freud in the current discussion
T2  - Vertex (Buenos Aires, Argentina)
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The discussion on the scientific character of psychoanalysis is continuous and multifaceted. Nowadays the extent and variety of the implied aspects in it is even increased. In this context this article presents for its analysis and assessment a reconsideration of Freuds line of argument regarding the scientific character of psychoanalysis. Against a quite spread view that conceives Freuds scientific perspective as a reflex of general traits of his time such as positivism, sustained by recent research on Freud this article proposes the reconsideration of Freuds perspective in a more exhaustive andnuanced way and holds that it is based on a composed by integrated parts, unified and consistent line of argument maintained through all his work. The reconsideration of the design of Freuds argument allows to hold that his own formulation is still fruitful and suitable for the present, particularly as it possibilitates, justifies and requires the connection of psychoanalysis to the development of knowledge.
AB  - La discusion respecto del caracter cientifico del psicoanalisis es continuada y multifacetica. En la actualidad la extension y variedad de aspectos implicados en ella sigue aun incrementandose. En este contexto el presente trabajo plantea para su analisis y evaluacion una reconsideracion de la argumentacion de Freud respecto del caracter cientifico del psicoanalisis. Frente a una difundida vision que concibe la perspectiva cientifica de Freud como un reflejo de caracterizaciones generales de epoca, por ejemplo, positivismo, el presente trabajo apoyandose en lineas de investigacion sobre Freud recientes, propone la reconsideracion de su perspectiva de modo mas especifico y matizado. Sostiene que ella se basa en una argumentacion basada en una concepcion flexible de la metodologia ciencia y en una concepcion de la ciencia como forma cultural en desarrollo; argumentacion compuesta de partes integradas, unificada y consistente, mantenida a traves de toda la obra de Freud. La reconsideracion del diseno de la argumentacion de Freud permite sostener entonces que su propia formulacion es fructifera aun para el presente en tanto posibilita, justifica y requiere la conexion del psicoanalisis con el desarrollo del conocimiento.

TI  - Grid Inertia and Damping Support Enabled by Proposed Virtual Inductance Control for Grid-Forming Virtual Synchronous Generator
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inertia and damping are the core index of the estimation of power system stability. Existing analysis to the support of inertia and damping are focused on the improvement of system stability as well as parameters tuning of virtual inertia and virtual damping but rarely involved in the quantitative calculation of level of inertia and damping under a certain condition. Based on this background, this article puts forward a unified calculation method to identify the equivalence of inertia and damping under various ratios of R-g/X-g. In addition, the quantity of improved inertia and damping support enabled by virtual inductance control are estimated by the derived calculation model of equivalence. The calculated mathematical model of equivalence of inertia and damping is well verified by the overlapped eigenvalues distribution. Besides, the negative synchronous power will inevitably influence the aperiodic loss of synchronization (ALoS) of power system caused by the large virtual inductance. Therefore, a solution should be derived to make a compromise between oscillation damping and ALoS by tuning the value of virtual inductance. Finally, the simulation and experiment results in various cases verify the effectiveness of the proposed equivalent damping and inertia calculation method as well as virtual inductance control.

T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - The impact of building the Belt and Road on the ecological environment and the health of the related cities along this belt deserves more attention. Currently, there are few relevant pieces of research in this area, and the problem of a time lag between the ecological environment and health (e.g., life expectancy, LE) has not been explored. This paper investigates the aforementioned problem based on five ecological indicators, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area index, gross primary production (GPP), land surface temperature (LST), and wet, which were obtained from MODIS satellite remote-sensing products in 2010, 2015, and 2020. The research steps are as follows: firstly, a comprehensive ecological index (CEI) of the areas along the Belt and Road was calculated based on the principle of component analysis; secondly, the changes in the trends of the five ecological indicators and the CEI in the research area in the past 11 years were calculated by using the trend degree analysis method; then, the distributions of the cold and hot spots of each index in the research area were calculated via cold and hot spot analysis; finally, the time lag relationship between LE and the ecological environment was explored by using the proposed spatiotemporal lag spatial crosscorrelation analysis. The experimental results show that ① there is a positive correlation between LE and ecological environment quality in the study area; ② the ecological environment has a lagging impact on LE, and the impact of ecological indicators in 2010 on LE in 2020 is greater than that in 2015; ③ among the ecological indicators, GPP has the highest impact on LE, while LST and Wet have a negative correlation with LE.

T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 21 May 2021 Mw 7.4 Maduo earthquake ruptured a 170 km long immature strike-slip fault within the eastern Tibetan plateau. Based on pixel correlation of pre-and postevent Sentinel-2 optical satellite images (band 8; pixel = 10 m), we deter-mine the coseismic horizontal displacement and deformation-zone width at the surface. These results, compared with the on-fault slip from geological measurements, docu-ment that <20% of the fault displacement is localized on the fault plane, whereas as high as >80% of the fault displacement occurred as off-fault deformation (OFD), over a mean deformation-zone width of 835 m (ranging from 60 to 1670 m). The OFD% of the Maduo earthquake is significantly larger than the OFD% (28%-64%) of all other (eight in total) previously documented earthquakes occurring on immature strike-slip faults, amongst which five earthquake faults have a structural maturity (cumulative displace-ment) even lower than the Maduo earthquake fault. These observations may be explained by that (1) the fault maturity is not the only factor controlling the behavior of OFD or the degree of strain localization during an earthquake, or that (2) the calcu-lated OFD includes some elastic deformation due to fault slip reduction in the shallow depth. Our results have an implication that the seismic hazard assessment of immature strike-slip faults is more challenging than previously thought.

AB  - Urbanization as a human activity alters the surface structure, modifying the urban ecological environment. In this study, the greenness, wetness, building index, and heatness of Dalian, a coastal city in northeast China, were extracted from the summer MODIS remote sensing data of 2010 and 2022, and the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) was created based on spatial principal component analysis. The artificial impervious surface fraction (AISF) in Dalian was extracted to analyze the impact of urban expansion on urban ecological environment with the background of urbanization, the spatial and temporal change characteristics of the urban ecological environment in Dalian from 2010 to 2022 were thoroughly evaluated. The results show that: (1) Dalian's RSEI in 2010 and 2022 primarily ranged from 0.2 to 0.8. During 2010-2022, the RSEI in urban built-up areas decreased from 0.2-0.4 to 0-0.2. However, the areas of RSEI approaching 1 have increased significantly in the past ten years, mainly distributed in original forest land or ecological land in the northern areas of Dalian. (2) From 2010 to 2022, Dalian's natural environment showed a positive development in which, the area with enhanced ecological quality accounted for 59.09%; however, the proportion of ecological land with RSEI greater than 0.8 declined from 76.64% to 51.05% and the proportion of urban building land rose from 1.11% to 11.85%, demonstrating that urbanization has had a substantial impact on the urban natural environment and has altered the urban land use structure. (3) The AISF of Dalian's urban center area was found to exceed 70% and is centered in the south's densely built-up area. The urban expansion boundary extending from the city center to the surrounding territory has an AISF ranging from 20% to 70%. This study objectively analyzed the geographical and temporal features of the ecological environment, as well as the impact of urbanization, and offers constructive recommendations for urban building design and population distribution optimization.

TI  - Effects of Urban Redevelopment on Surface Urban Heat Island
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion and urban redevelopment can affect the surface urban heat island (SUHI) phenomenon, a major topic in the study of urban climates. The effects of urban expansion on SUHI have been studied by numerous researchers, while the effects of urban redevelopment remain unclear. We aimed to understand the effects of urban redevelopment on SUHI. Using the thermal bands of Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 TIRS, we retrieved the land surface temperature and calculated the SUHI intensity of the redevelopment areas during 2000-2019 in Guangzhou (China). Based on the high-spatial-resolution images from Google Earth, 253 redevelopment areas were identified and classified as village low residential areas, low-industrial areas, middle residential areas, high residential areas, and commercial areas. Furthermore, the change in SUHI intensity in redevelopment areas was analyzed. Results showed that urban redevelopment, including the transitions from urban village to high-rise commercial land, from low-rise industrial land to high-rise residential land, from industrial land to parking lot, from bare land to mid-rise buildings, and from parking lot to high-rise commercial land, can considerably reduce the speed of increase of local SUHI intensity. These new findings have theoretical and practical implications for urban planning and redevelopment.

TI  - Absorbing Aerosol Optical Depth From OMI/TROPOMI Based on the GBRT Algorithm and AERONET Data in Asia
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the concentration of absorbing aerosol is essential for pollution tracking and calculation of atmospheric radiative forcing. To quickly obtain absorbing aerosol optical depth (AAOD) with high-resolution and high-accuracy, the gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT) method based on the joint data from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MODIS), and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) is used for TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Compared with the ground-based data, the correlation coefficient of the results is greater than 0.6 and the difference is generally within +/- 0.04. Compared with OMI data, the underestimation has been greatly improved. By further restricting the impact factors, three valid conclusions can be drawn: 1) the model with more spatial difference information achieves better results than the model with more temporal difference information; 2) the training dataset with a high cloud fraction (0.1-0.4) can partly improve the performance of GBRT results; and 3) when aerosol optical depth (AOD) is less than 0.3, the perform of retrieved AAODs is still good by comparing with ground-based measurements. The novel finding is expected to contribute to regional and even urban anthropogenic pollution research.

TI  - Ant-Inspired Bionic Design Method for the Support Structure of the Fengyun-3 Satellite Payload Infilled with Lattice Structure
T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to their high design freedom and excellent performance, lattice structures have shown outstanding capabilities and great potential in aeronautics and astronautics fields. In this paper, we propose a method to construct lattice structures by parameterizing biological features. An ant-leg configuration is used as the bionic object to generate a bionic lightweight design with a gradient lattice structure. To achieve the above goal, an innovative optimization method combining topology optimization, size optimization, and a bionic lattice structure is proposed in this paper. Taking the support structure of the Fengyun-3 satellite payload as the research object, this optimization method is applied to optimize the design. Further, the reconstructed optimization model and the original model are simulated to evaluate and compare the structural performance. The simulation results show that when combined with bionic lattice structure and structural optimization, the method can achieve the lightweight design goal while ensuring the stiffness and strength of the structure. The results demonstrate that the application of a bionic lattice design in a lightweight design has feasibility and expectable potential.

TI  - Enhancing Remote Sensing Image Unsupervised Hashing Cross-modal Correlation with Similarity Matrix
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous enrichment of satellite-borne and airborne remote sensing detection methods, the types of remote sensing data obtained are more diverse and the data scale is constantly expanding, which strongly drives the development of cross-modal correlation methods in the field of remote sensing. Cross-modal retrieval task refers to retrieving relevant data from other modes according to the query samples in a given mode. Multi-modal data usually includes images, text, video, audio, etc. Remote sensing image and text are important components of intelligence information, and the establishment of correlation between remote sensing image and text information is of great significance to the effective use of multi-source intelligence data. The mutual verification of the two is helpful to further improve the reliability of acquiring intelligence information. Remote sensing data usually contains rich information, but getting serviceable knowledge from the massive data effectively can be very challenging. With the continuous development of deep learning, deep neural networks are more and more widely used to obtain feature representations of different modes. Mapping cross-modal information into the same feature space is helpful to solve the "heterogeneous gap" problem among different modalities. Hashing method achieves fast retrieval speed and high efficiency. With the growth of remote sensing data type and scale, it has attracted more and more attention in the field of remote sensing cross modal. However, the existing unsupervised deep hashing cross-mode methods still have some problems. Usually, the similarity information across modes is learned separately, and without the assistance of label information, the model cannot obtain the semantic correlation between different modes correctly and effectively. In addition, most deep hash methods generate hash codes directly from the original features obtained by deep neural networks, and the generated hash features are difficult to obtain satisfactory discrimination information. In general, data from different modalities could give people a comprehensive description of the same object. As a result of the applicability and flexibility of cross modal retrieval, multiple methods of it have been widely explored in the computer vision community. In recent years, some studies have been conducted on cross-modal retrieval in the field of remote sensing. But most of the existing cross-modal correlation methods in remote sensing field are based on real value representation, which has problems of slow correlation retrieval speed and large memory consumption. However, the hash coding method can effectively improve the efficiency of association retrieval and is more suitable for large-scale and rapid association retrieval tasks. However, some semantic information will be lost during the transformation of the hash code. Therefore, this paper proposes an unsupervised hash-cross-modal association method for remote sensing images assisted by a similarity matrix. The constructed original feature and the similarity matrix of the hash feature are used to integrate the semantic correlation information between different modes, so as to preserve the semantic correlation within modes and between different modes as much as possible, and reduce the loss of feature information when the original feature is converted to hash code through semantic alignment between similarity matrices. The loss function uses the weighted sum of the similarity matrix loss and contrast loss.The combination of the two effectively improves the accuracy of unsupervised cross-modal hash association, which is more suitable for large-scale cross-modal remote sensing image association retrieval tasks. Experimental results on benchmark datasets in the remote sensing field show that the proposed method performs better than the existing benchmark method. However, the design of the original feature extraction module of the model does not fully consider the semantic information richness of each mode, and the calculation method of the similarity matrix is relatively simple. Future work can be further improved on the accuracy of association.

AB  - Computational notebooks are widely used for data analysis. Their interleaved displays of code and execution results (e.g., visualizations) are welcomed since they enable iterative analysis and preserve the exploration process. However, the communication of data fndings remains challenging in computational notebooks. Users have to carefully identify useful fndings from useless ones, document them with texts and visual embellishments, and then organize them in diferent tools. Such workfow greatly increases their workload, according to our interviews with practitioners. To address the challenge, we designed Notable to offer on-the-fy assistance for data storytelling in computational notebooks. It provides intelligent support to minimize the work of documenting and organizing data fndings and diminishes the cost of switching between data exploration and storytelling. To evaluate Notable, we conducted a user study with 12 data workers. The feedback from user study participants verifes its efectiveness and usability.

TI  - AMHC-DTENet: Attention-Based Multipath Hybrid Convolutional Distribution Target Extraction Network for Polarimetric Channel Imbalance Assessment
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Manual selection of the distribution target and determination of its spatial location is not only time consuming but also has a serious impact on the polarimetric channel imbalances assessment if the area is incorrect. However, the existing automatic extraction methods are affected by the morphology of the features, and their local feature extraction capability is limited. On the other hand, only local information is considered, while the feature channels and global information are ignored, which in turn leads to the limited application scenarios, especially in some urban areas. The polarimetric channel imbalance estimation accuracy is so low that it exceeds the system tolerance limit. Therefore, in order to more effectively mine the polarimetric features of distributed targets in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar images, we propose an attention-based multipath hybrid convolutional distribution target extraction network for polarimetric channel imbalance assessment. First, in order to develop the local feature extraction capability of the hierarchical network, we design a hybrid convolutional module with adaptive adjustment of the receptive field size. Second, a polarimetric feature channel reconstruction module is constructed in order to utilize the spatial information of the polarimetric feature channels. Then, considering that the polarimetric information of the ground feature is sensitive to the relative geometry of the target attitude to the radar line of sight, the vision transformer architecture is used to capture polarimetric global information and extend it to multipath. Finally, Gaofen-3(GF-3) full-polarimetric data are used for experimental verification. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method.

TI  - Prediction of Urban Forest Aboveground Carbon Using Machine Learning Based on Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2: A Case Study of Shanghai, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aboveground carbon storage (AGC) of urban forests is an important indicator reflecting the ecological function of urban forests. It is essential to monitor the AGC of urban forests and analyze their spatiotemporal distributions. Remote sensing is a technical tool that can be leveraged to accurately monitor forest AGC, whereas machine learning is an important algorithm for the accurate prediction of AGC. Therefore, in this study, single Landsat 8 (L) remote sensing data, single Sentinel-2 (S) remote sensing data, and combined Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (L + S) data are used as data sources. Four machine learning methods, support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting), and CatBoost (categorical boosting), are used to predict forest AGC based on two phases of forest sample plots in Shanghai. We chose the optimal model to predict the AGC and simulate the spatiotemporal distribution. The study shows that both machine learning models based on separate Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing data can accurately predict the AGC and spatiotemporal distribution of the Shanghai urban forest. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the combined data (L + S) and CatBoost-integrated AGC models is higher than the others, with fitting and validation accuracy R2 values of 0.99 and 0.70, respectively. The RMSE was also smaller at 0.67 and 6.29 Mg/ha, respectively. The uncertainty of the AGC spatial distribution in the Shanghai urban forest derived from the CatBoost model prediction from the 2016-2019 data was small and consistent with the actual situation. Furthermore, the statistics showed that the AGC of the Shanghai forest increased from 24.90 Mg/ha in 2016 to 25.61 Mg/ha in 2019.

TI  - The Merit of Estimating High-Resolution Soil Moisture Using Combined Optical, Thermal, and Microwave Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tremendous progress has been made in estimating soil moisture (SM) from satellite remote sensing data. Several global-scale coarse-resolution products have also been generated and released for various applications in the Earth system. However, high-resolution SM estimation is still in its infancy. Currently, two main methods are used for this purpose: downscaling approaches and direct retrieval from microwave and optical/thermal data. Several studies have attempted to comprehensively evaluate the performance of these approaches and have found that each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, with no single method outperforming the others. In this study, we aim to investigate the advantages of integrating optical, thermal, and microwave data to estimate SM by leveraging an intensive SM network and triple collocation (TC) method. First, we determined the best-performing coarse-resolution microwave SM product through the TC approach. Second, we generated 1-km SM using a downscaling approach based on land surface temperature and vegetation index, utilizing the best-performing SMAP L3 descending product. Third, we evaluated the high-resolution downscaled SM, Sentinel 1 SM, and SMAP/Sentinel 1 combined SM products using SM measurements from the REMEDHUS station network, ETOPO1 elevation, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) precipitation, and the European Space Agency (ESA) CCI land cover map. Finally, we investigated and demonstrated the advantages of merging these products through point-scale evaluation and large-scale spatial pattern comparison.

TI  - Removing Influence of MODIS Strip Noise in Spatiotemporal Fusion of Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) can produce synthetic remote sensing data with both high spatial and high temporal resolution by blending the temporally sparse fine resolution data and temporally dense coarse resolution data, for which it has been adopted in many fields, such as agriculture, environment, and ecology. In the literature, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images are the most frequently employed as the coarse resolution images in STF due to their high quality and availability. However, the MODIS images contain significant strip noise sometimes, which will lead to unfavorable fusion results. In this letter, a MODIS strip noise removal strategy for STF (NRSTF) is suggested. Specifically, the NRSTF first removes the strip noise of MODIS image of the base time utilizing the bands relationship from the base fine resolution image, then reconstructs that of the predicted time via an adaptive convolution-based noise estimation approach. Finally, the reconstructed, noise-free MODIS images are fused with the base fine resolution image to predict the missing fine resolution images. Four wildly used STF approaches, including spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion method (STARFM), flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) method, Fit-FC, and reliable and adaptive spatiotemporal data fusion (RASDF) are selected to test the NRSTF on an actual Landsat-MODIS dataset, whose MODIS images suffers from serious strip noise in two short wave infrared (SWIR) bands. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed NRSTF can not only effectively eliminate strip noise, but also significantly enhance the accuracy and applicability of the fusion results. The source code of NRSTF is available at https://github.com/lijli26/NRSTF.git.

TI  - Multiform Ensemble Self-Supervised Learning for Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Self-supervised learning is an effective way to solve model collapse for few-shot remote sensing scene classification (FSRSSC). However, most self-supervised contrastive learning auxiliary tasks perform poorly on the high interclass similarity problem in FSRSSC. Furthermore, it is time-consuming and computationally expensive to obtain the best combination among numerous self-supervised auxiliary tasks. In practical applications, we may encounter difficulties in remote sensing data acquisition and labeling, while most FSRSSC studies only focus on the former. To alleviate the above problems, we propose a multiform ensemble self-supervised learning ((MESL)-L-2) framework for FSRSSC in this article. Based on the transfer learning-based few-shot scheme, we design a novel global-local contrastive learning auxiliary task to solve the low interclass separability problem. The self-attention mechanism is designed in the local contrast features to investigate the intrinsic associations between different remote sensing scene objectives. We also present a multiform ensemble enhancement (MEE) training method. Ensemble enhancement involves the concatenation of features extracted from different backbones trained by a combination of multiform self-supervised auxiliary tasks. MEE can not only be regarded as a more straightforward alternative to knowledge distillation but also can achieve an effective compromise between expensive computational cost and classification accuracy. In addition, we provide two scene classification schemes of inductive and transductive settings, corresponding to solving the difficulties of remote sensing data acquisition and labeling. The proposed network achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark FSRSSC datasets. The potential of the (MESL)-L-2 framework is also demonstrated in combination with classical metalearning-based and metric learning-based few-shot algorithms.

TI  - Dynamic Evaluation of Agricultural Drought Hazard in Northeast China Based on Coupled Multi-Source Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the climate warms, the impact of drought on plants has increased. We aimed to construct a comprehensive drought index (CDI), coupling soil-vegetation-atmosphere drought and heat conditions based on multi-source information, and to combine it with static and dynamic drought hazard evaluation models to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of agricultural drought disasters and hazards during the growing season (May to September) in Northeast China (NEC). The results demonstrated that the CDI could combine the benefits of meteorology (standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, SPEI), vegetation (vegetation health index, VHI), and soil (standardized soil moisture condition index, SMCI) indices. This was performed using a relative weighting method based on the remote sensing data of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to determine the weights of SPEI, VHI, and SMCI. The CDI for drought monitoring has the advantages of broad spatial range, long time range, and high accuracy, and can effectively reflect agricultural drought; the growing season in NEC showed a trend of becoming drier during 1982-2020. However, the trends of the drought index, the impact range of drought events, and the hazard of agricultural drought all turned around 2000. The drought hazard was highly significant (p < 0.001) and decreased from 2000 to 2020. The frequency of drought disasters was the highest, and the hazard was the greatest in May. The best level of climatic yield anomalies in maize were explained by drought hazard in August (R-2 = 0.28). In the center and western portions of the study area, farmland and grassland areas were where higher levels of hazard were most commonly seen. The dynamic hazard index is significantly correlated with climatic yield anomalies and can reflect the actual impact of drought on crop yield. The study results serve as a scientific foundation for drought risk assessment and management, agricultural planning, and the formulation of drought adaptation policies, as well as for ensuring food security in China.

TI  - Mixing Self-Attention and Convolution: A Unified Framework for Multisource Remote Sensing Data Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolution and self-attention are two powerful techniques for multisource remote sensing (RS) data fusion that have been widely adopted in Earth observation tasks. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are inadequate for fully mining contextual information and representing the sequence attributes of spectral signatures. In addition, the specific self-attention mechanism often comes with high-computational costs, which hinders its application in the field of RS. To overcome the above limitations, this article proposes a unified framework called "mixing self-attention and convolution network (MACN)" for comprehensive feature extraction and efficient feature fusion. First, the proposed MACN utilizes two adaptive CNN encoders (ACEs) to extract shallow convolutional features from multisource RS data. Second, taking the complexity and varying scales of RS data into account, the proposed mixing self-attention and convolution Transformer (MACT) layer achieves local and global multiscale perception through an elegant integration of self-attention and convolution. MACT can extract abundant spatial and high-dimensional information (e.g., spectral and elevation information) while maintaining minimal computational overhead compared with pure convolution or self-attention counterparts. Finally, a multisource cross-guided fusion (MCGF) module is designed to achieve deep fusion of multisource RS data features. MCGF utilizes a carefully designed cross-modal attention mechanism to capture the interaction between multisource data and aggregate contextual information. Extensive tests on six public RS datasets have shown that our method outperforms other multisource fusion models, delivering state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple RS data fusion tasks without specific tuning. The source code of the proposed method will be available publicly at https://github.com/like413/MACN.

TI  - Quantitative Evaluation of Dust and Black Carbon Column Concentration in the MERRA-2 Reanalysis Dataset Using Satellite-Based Component Retrievals
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol optical property products of Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis dataset have been extensively investigated on a global or regional scale. However, the understanding of MERRA-2 aerosol component products on an extensive temporal and spatial scale is inadequate. Recently, the aerosol component products have been derived from the observations of Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances/Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectance for Atmospheric Science coupled with observations from a Lidar (POLDER/PARASOL). This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the MERRA-2 reanalysis dust and black carbon (BC) column concentration using independent satellite-based aerosol component concentration retrievals. Both GRASP/Component and MERRA-2 reanalysis products can capture well the temporal variation in dust column concentration over the dust emission resource and downwind dust-dominated regions with the correlation coefficient (R) varying from 0.80 to 0.98. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 20 similar to 70%, except in the Taklamakan Desert and Bay of Bengal, where the relative differences can be negative. The differences in dust column concentration over the African dust regions are larger than that over the Asian dust regions. Similar temporal variations in BC column concentration are characterized by both GRASP/Component BC retrievals and MERRA-2 BC products with R of about 0.70 similar to 0.90, except in the North China Plain region. We should pay more caution with the regional applicability of MERRA-2 component products when large differences and high correlation coefficients are obtained simultaneously. The results are favorable for identifying the behavior of MERRA-2 reanalysis component estimation in a new view and demonstrate a practical application of the satellite-based component retrievals, which could make more contributions to the improvement of model estimation in the near future.

TI  - Climate Change and Diurnal Warming: Impacts on the Growth of Different Vegetation Types in the North-South Transition Zone of China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Since land use/cover change profoundly impacts climate change and global warming has become an irreversible trend in the Anthropocene, there have been numerous global studies on the impact of climate change on vegetation growth (VG). However, the effects of climate extremes on the growth and direction of various vegetation types need to be better investigated, especially in the climate transition zones. In this paper, we examined the effect of diurnal warming on the growth of various types of vegetation in China's north-south transition zone. Based on the daily observation data of 92 meteorological stations in the Qinling-Daba (Qinba) mountainous area from 1982 to 2015, coupled with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and data on the type of vegetation. This research examined the temporal changes in the highest and lowest temperatures during the last 33 years using trend analysis. Second-order correlation analysis was used to investigate vegetation NDVI response characteristics to diurnal warming and to examine the effect of diurnal warming on the growth of different vegetation types. Our results showed that maximum temperature (T-max) and minimum temperature (T-min) showed an obvious upward trend, with the daytime temperature increase rate 1.2 times that at night, but failing the t-test. In addition, diurnal warming promoted vegetation growth, with NDVI associated positively correlated with T-max at approximately 91.2% of the sites and 3492 rasters and with T-min at roughly 53.25% of the sites and 2864 rasters. Spatial significance analysis showed an apparent difference, but few areas passed the t-test. Furthermore, daytime warming enhanced the growth of grasses, shrubs, deciduous broad-leaved forests, crops, and conifers, while the effect of nighttime warming on VG had a positive effect only on the growth of evergreen broad-leaved forest vegetation. These findings reveal the mechanisms of the impact of climate extremes on VG under global change, particularly the extent to which different vegetation types in climatic transitional zones respond to climate extremes.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations and relationships of absorbing aerosol-radiation-gross primary productivity over China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High-load carbonaceous and dust aerosols can significantly reduce direct radiation (DIRR), which would affect photosynthesis in terrestrial ecosystems, thereby further affecting the productivity of vegetation. Based on this, a variety of remote sensing data were used to study the spatiotemporal distributions and changing tendencies of the absorbing aerosols, CO, DIRR, and gross primary productivity (GPP) in China during 2005-2019; then, the relationships were analyzed between different types of absorbing aerosols and DIRR as well as GPP. The results showed that the annual mean absorbing aerosols index (AAI) in China during 2005-2019 was 0.39, with a slow growth rate of 0.02 year(-1), and the emission of CO showed a decreasing trend with each passing year, especially in North China Plain and Sichuan Basin. Carbonaceous and dust aerosols were predominantly bounded by Hu line. The east of Hu line was the dominant area of carbonaceous aerosols, and the west of Hu line was the topographical region of dust aerosols. Near the Hu line was the dominant area of carbonaceous-dust aerosols. However, the Karamay-Urumqi-Hami area and Northeast China Plain were exceptional. During the vegetation growing season, different types of absorbing aerosols significantly negatively affected GPP. From a perspective of regional scale variation pattern, the negative effect of absorbing aerosols on vegetation productivity was the most significant in Northeast China; from the perspective of the effects of different vegetation types, the negative effect of absorbing aerosols on grasslands was greater than that of woodlands; from the perspective of the composition characteristics of aerosols, the negative effect of dust aerosols on GPP was greater than that of carbonaceous aerosols.

TI  - Detecting Building Changes Using Multimodal Siamese Multitask Networks From Very-High-Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two main issues are faced when using very-high-spatial-resolution (VHR) satellite images for building change detection: 1) the boundaries of detected changes are hard to be consistent with the ground truth and 2) detected changes are easily affected by different viewing angles of bitemporal images, leading to noticeable false changes. To deal with these issues, this study develops a new Siamese change detection network [i.e., Siamese multitask change detection network (SMCD-Net)] based on a multitask learning framework to improve building change detection, particularly in the geometric aspect. Boundary information is formulated as an auxiliary task to constrain the learning of high-level semantic features. To enhance the identification of real changes from false changes, we model the directional relationships between buildings and their shadows by fuzzy sets, and incorporate the relationship information into SMCD-Net, leading to a network variant, labeled as SMCD-Net-m. Experiments were conducted on three datasets: a publicly available dataset, a Chinese GaoFen-2 dataset, and a French Pleiades dataset. We compared our methods with seven other methods, i.e., object-based Siamese network, ChangeStar, ChangeFormer, BIT, STANet, FC-Siam-diff, and Siam-NestedUNet. Results showed that the proposed SMCD-Net obtained the best detection results, achieving the lowest global total errors on all datasets. By incorporating directional information, SMCD-Net-m evidently improved detection accuracy, particularly when using bitemporal images with a large viewing angle difference. The improvement was positively correlated with the accuracy of building shadows extracted from VHR images.

TI  - Remote Sensing Object Detection Based on Strong Feature Extraction and Prescreening Network
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing object detection has been an important and challenging research hot spot in computer vision that is widely used in military and civilian fields. Recently, the combined detection model of convolutional neural network (CNN) and transformer has achieved good results, but the problem of poor detection performance of small objects still needs to be solved urgently. This letter proposes a deformable end-to-end object detection with transformers (DETR)-based framework for object detection in remote sensing images. First, multiscale split attention (MSSA) is designed to extract more detailed feature information by grouping. Next, we propose multiscale deformable prescreening attention (MSDPA) mechanism in decoding layer, which achieves the purpose of prescreening, so that the encoder-decoder structure can obtain attention map more efficiently. Finally, the A-D loss function is applied to the prediction layer, increasing the attention of small objects and optimizing the intersection over union (IOU) function. We conduct extensive experiments on the DOTA v1.5 dataset and the HRRSD dataset, which show that the reconstructed detection model is more suitable for remote sensing objects, especially for small objects. The average detection accuracy in DOTA dataset has improved by 4.4% (up to 75.6%), especially the accuracy of small objects has raised by 5%.

TI  - Optimized Radiomics Nomogram Based on Automated Breast Ultrasound System: A Potential Tool for Preoperative Prediction of Metastatic Lymph Node Burden in Breast Cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER-TARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be safely avoided in women with T1 or T2 primary invasive breast cancer (BC) and one to two metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). However, cancellation of ALND based solely on SLN biopsy (SLNB) may lead to adverse outcomes. Therefore, preoperative assessment of LN tumor burden becomes a new focus for ALN status.Objective: This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram incorporating the radiomics score (rad-score) based on automated breast ultrasound system (ABUS) and other clinicopathological features for evaluating the ALN status in patients with early-stage BC preoperatively.Methods: Totally 354 and 163 patients constituted the training and validation cohorts. They were divided into ALN low burden (<3 metastatic LNs) and high burden (>= 3 metastatic LNs) based on the histopathological diagnosis. The radiomics features of the segmented breast tumor in ABUS images were extracted and selected to generate the rad-score of each patient. These rad-scores, along with the ALN burden predictors identified from the clinicopathologic characteristics, were included in the multivariate analysis to establish a nomogram. It was further evaluated in the training and validation cohorts.Results: High ALN burdens accounted for 11.2% and 10.8% in the training and validation cohorts. The rad-score for each patient was developed based on 7 radiomics features extracted from the ABUS images. The radiomics nomogram was built with the rad-score, tumor size, US-reported LN status, and ABUS retraction phenomenon. It achieved better predictive efficacy than the nomogram without the rad-score and exhibited favorable discrimination, calibration and clinical utility in both cohorts.Conclusion: We developed an ABUS-based radiomics nomogram for the preoperative prediction of ALN burden in BC patients. It would be utilized for the identification of patients with low ALN burden if further validated, which contributed to appropriate axillary treatment and might avoid unnecessary ALND.

TI  - Sun Glint Correction Based on BRDF Model for Improving the HY-1C/COCTS Clear-Sky Coverage
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Haiyang-1C (HY-1C) satellite was launched on September 7, 2018. The Chinese Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (COCTS) onboard HY-1C has the capacity for ocean color and sea surface temperature (SST) observations. The sun glint reflected on sea surface can interfere with the radiance reaching the field of view of satellite sensor, leading to the higher reflectance that is misclassified as cloud and restrictions of satellite data availability. Due to the lack of ability to avoid sun glint, the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model is implemented in the sun glint correction of HY-1C/COCTS visible images. The atmospheric direct transmittance is calculated by aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Rayleigh optical depth (ROD). The comparisons before and after sun glint correction of visible images at different locations and different time are discussed and analyzed. The spectra are compared before and after the sun glint correction, and it has an obvious decrease in both radiance and reflectance. The performance of the BRDF model in low, moderate, and severe glint contaminations is compared. The results indicate that the BRDF model is useful in the sun glint correction of visible bands and leading to more HY-1C/COCTS clear-sky coverage, as consequence can be applied as the preprocessing in the cloud detection and SST retrieval to improve the clear-sky coverage.

TI  - InSAR-Derived Coastal Subsidence Reveals New Inundation Scenarios Over the Yellow River Delta
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal subsidence exacerbates relative sea level rise (SLR) and increases the risk of coastal flooding. However, the contribution of local land subsidence (LLS) in the Yellow river delta (YRD) to the relative SLR remains unclear, leading to a gap in the understanding of future inundation scenarios. In this article, we firstly used five years of Sentinel-1 data to generate the high-accuracy coastal subsidence of the YRD. Radar interferometry (InSAR) results show that fast subsiding funnels larger than 50 mm/yr are mainly distributed in the brine mining clusters, and the maximum subsidence rate exceeds 300 mm/yr. We then proposed an inundation estimation method by combining extended seeded region growing model, InSAR-derived LLS and SLR. This method can effectively output the coastal inundation time series, quantify and characterize the changes of inundation area and depth without detailed hydrodynamic conditions. Moreover, we presented high spatiotemporal resolution inundation scenarios for the entire YRD, revealing that in the absence of control measures, annual subsidence of 19 mm/yr contributes at least three times more than that SLR to the increased flood risk in 2050 under the low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6). However, under the scenario of SSP5-8.5, 4611 km(2) of land would be inundated by 2100 and coastal dams are extremely likely to be damaged. This article is expected to provide a practical and cost-effective alternative to understanding the contribution of coastal subsidence to the relative SLR, and for choosing when and how to mitigate land subsidence to prevent future coastal flooding in the delta.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Retrieval From Sentinel-3A SLSTR Data: Comparison Among Split-Window, Dual-Window, Three-Channel, and Dual-Angle Algorithms
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a vital parameter for studying global ecological, climatic, and environmental changes. Although various LST retrieval algorithms have been proposed, including split-window (SW), dual-window (DW), three-channel (TC), and dual-angle (DA) algorithms, few studies have compared these algorithms using the same satellite observations. The Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) onboard Sentinel-3A provides a unique opportunity to conduct this comparison due to its DA viewing capability and multiple thermal infrared (TIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) channels. Here, we implemented two SW algorithms, one DW algorithm, two TC algorithms, and one DA algorithm for the SLSTR data. The LST retrievals from these six algorithms were validated, along with the SLSTR operational LST product based on an emissivity-implicit SW algorithm. Temperature- and radiance-based validation methods were used to evaluate different LST retrievals across different land cover types (LCTs). The results indicated that the proposed SW algorithm had the highest accuracy, followed by the Perez-Planells SW and the official algorithms. The overall root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of these three SW algorithms were 1.42, 1.79, and 2.05 K. The three algorithms involving the MIR channel (one DW and two TC algorithms) were more suitable for nighttime LST retrieval and had similar performances to the three SW algorithms, with a nighttime RMSE of approximately 1.36 K. The LST retrieval accuracy of the DA algorithm had the highest uncertainty and was closely related to the angular variation in surface emissivity and brightness temperature (BT). The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the different LST retrieval algorithms and facilitate potential improvements in the official LST retrieval algorithm for SLSTR.

TI  - Rigorous Sensor Model of Gaofen-7 Satellite Laser Altimeter Based on Coupled Footprint Camera
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gaofen-7 (GF-7) satellite system adds a footprint camera that shares the same optical path as its laser altimeter to ensure consistent spatial referencing between the laser footprint point and the obtained optical images. However, this introduces additional errors between the two different loads while ensuring the geometric relations of the laser altimeter and footprint camera. First, the accuracy and error analyses of the laser altimeter and footprint camera are carried out based on the working mode of the GF-7 satellite laser altimeter and footprint camera in this study. A rigorous sensor model of laser geometric positioning is proposed based on the coupled footprint camera, which is achieved for the geometric correlation of laser spots on the ground and the focal plane of the footprint camera. The satellite laser altimeter simulation platform was used to analyze the various error sources in the geometric positioning of the laser altimeter, and GF-7 satellite data were used to verify the proposed geometric positioning model of the laser altimeter and footprint camera. The results show that the positioning error of the GF-7 footprint camera is less than 5 m (root-mean-square error) relative to the dual-line array image, which can provide ground control points for stereo mapping.

TI  - WHU-Stereo: A Challenging Benchmark for Stereo Matching of High-Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stereo matching of high-resolution satellite images (HRSIs) is still a fundamental but challenging task in the field of photogrammetry and remote sensing. Recently, deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated the potential for stereo matching on public benchmark datasets. Currently, mainstream stereo matching models depend on quantities of training data with ground truth. However, datasets for stereo matching of satellite images are scarce, which profoundly blocks the application of DL in this field. To facilitate further research, this article publishes a large-scale dataset, termed WHU-Stereo, for stereo matching DL network training and testing. This dataset is created by using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds and high-resolution stereo imageries taken from the Chinese GaoFen-7 (GF-7) satellite. Occlusions should be seriously considered in the generation of ground-truth disparities. We propose an occlusion removal technique, which can adapt to point clouds with different densities and shows high potential in training data preparation. The WHU-Stereo dataset contains more than 1700 epipolar rectified image pairs, which cover six areas in China and includes various kinds of landscapes. We have assessed the accuracy of ground-truth disparity maps, and it is shown that our dataset achieves comparable precision compared with existing state-of-the-art stereo matching datasets. To verify its feasibility, in experiments, the handcrafted semiglobal matching (SGM) algorithm and recent DL networks have been tested on the dataset. Experimental results show that the WHU-Stereo dataset can serve as a challenging benchmark for stereo matching of HRSIs and performance evaluation of DL models. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/Sheng029/WHU-Stereo.

TI  - Correction of the Residual Effect From Solar Beta Angle for Onboard Calibration of Satellite Calibration Spectrometer
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite calibration spectrometer (SCS) onboard HY-1C/HY-1D could support a direct calibration using the simultaneous nadir overpass (SNO) approach for imaging spectroradiometers with various band configurations on the same or different satellite platforms by providing precise hyperspectral radiance after onboard calibration employing a solar diffuser (SD). However, a unique phenomenon was discovered in the analysis of annual variations of onboard calibration coefficients of the SCS. Although the solar calibration scheme employing an SD was used, a season-dependent oscillation still existed, and the oscillation trend of calibration coefficients is highly correlated with the variation trend of solar beta angle. In this article, we analyzed the entire solar calibration results of SCS from HY-1C using more than three years of data and discovered that season-dependent oscillation is primarily due to the variations in the transmittance of the solar attenuation screen affected by satellite platform attitude. Furthermore, an accurate variation model of the incident angle on the solar attenuation screen was developed, and the findings demonstrate that the season-dependent oscillation of onboard calibration coefficients of SCS could be effectively removed. Finally, the model established in this article is validated by optical simulation, which shows its consistency and reliability.

TI  - Performances of Atmospheric Correction Processors for Sentinel-2 MSI Imagery Over Typical Lakes Across China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The launched MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) equipped on Sentinel-2 satellites offers a powerful tool for observing the biogeochemical parameters of inland waters on a large scale. The proper use of atmospheric correction processors is essential for acquiring accurate satellite remote-sensing reflectance and downstream products. Therefore, we compared the performances of typical atmospheric correction processors, such as Sen2Cor, C2RCC-nets, C2RCC-C2X, Acolite, iCOR, Polymer, SeaDas/l2gen, and 6S processors, for MSI imagery over lake groups (N = 296) across China collected from 2016 to 2020. Linear fitting between corrected reflectance and in situ spectral measurements was used to assess performance; for the single lake, we additionally evaluated the performance of atmospheric correction processors in typical Chagan Lake in 2021. For large-scale lake groups with different water quality backgrounds, the SeaDas/l2gen and C2RCC processors performed best for all band match-ups, and the C2RCC processor had the smallest errors. The SeaDas/l2gen processor works well for the signal bands (490, 560, 665, 704, and 740 nm), followed by the signal bands (560, 665, and 704 nm) of the C2RCC processor. For large-scale observations, this study revealed that Sentinel-2 satellite optical MSI imagery related to the C2RCC processor can be used to monitor aquatic systems with high-frequency investigations. For the signal band, the SeaDas/l2gen processor was used to select potential match-ups for the availability of MSI data related to the empirical models of processors. Our results may help satellite users select appropriate atmospheric correction processors for large-scale lake observations.

TI  - Monitoring of "7-20" Rainstorm Damage in the Zhengzhou Road Network Using Heterogeneous SAR Images
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the most frequently occurring meteorological disasters nowadays, and its occurrence can cause significant socio-economic losses. Aiming at the problem that traditional optical remote sensing makes it difficult to monitor floods, this paper designs a scheme to jointly extract the scope of the affected area by using heterogeneous satellite-based SAR images acquired at different times within the flood period. This paper takes the "7-20" rainstorm in Zhengzhou City as an example and uses two kinds of heterogeneous SAR images, Sentinel-1A and GF-3, to extract the flooding damage in the main urban area. In addition, combinations with the vector data of the Gaode road network were performed to further monitor and analyze the "7-20" rainstorm damage in the main urban area of Zhengzhou. The results showed that the main urban area of Zhengzhou City was affected by the "7-20" rainstorm. The roads in the main urban area of Zhengzhou were seriously affected, and the total length of the affected roads reached 1324.63 km. The monitoring scheme for flooding road network damage using Sentinel-1A and GF-3 heterogeneous SAR images has certain feasibility.

TI  - Monitoring the dynamic changes in vegetation cover and driving factors from 2000 to 2020 in the Maoershan Forest Farm region, China, using satellite remote sensing data
T2  - FOREST SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of study: Natural climate change is a central driver of global ecosystem and forest change. Climate change and topographical factors have had the greatest impact on different types of forests around the world. We used remote sensing technology to detect and analyze the temporal and spatial changes of forest vegetation to provide reference for regional management.Area of study: Maoershan Forest Farm, China.Material and methods: The Landsat images were preprocessed using ArcGIS and ENVI software. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated to identify vegetation changes from 2000 to 2020. In addition, the vegetation fraction cover (VFC) was calculated using the pixel binary model. The driving factors and their influences on vegetation changes in this region were determined using the random forest algorithm and Pearson correlation analysis method.Main results: From 2000 to 2020, the NDVI showed an overall increasing trend. The results indicated that compared with the climatic factors, topographic factors were more important to vegetation growth in the study area. Among the topographic factors, elevation was the most important factor affecting vegetation growth and both showed a negative correlation. Among the climatic factors, relative humidity was the primary driving factor affecting vegetation growth and both showed a positive correlation.Research highlights: Accurate and timely assessment of vegetation change and its relationship to climate and topographical changes can provide very useful information for policy makers, governments and planners in formulating management policies.

TI  - Widespread and complex drought effects on vegetation physiology inferred from space.
T2  - Nature communications
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - The response of vegetation physiology to drought at largespatial scales is poorly understood due to a lack of direct observations. Here, we study vegetation drought responses related to photosynthesis, evaporation, and vegetation water content using remotely sensed data, and we isolate physiological responses using a machine learning technique. We find that vegetation functional decreases are largelydriven by the downregulation of vegetation physiology such as stomatal conductance and light use efficiency, with the strongest downregulation in water-limited regions. Vegetation physiological decreases in wet regions also result in a discrepancy between functional and structural changes under severe drought. We find similar patterns of physiological drought response using simulations from a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum model coupled with a radiative transfer model. Observation-derived vegetation physiological responses to drought across space are mainly controlled by aridity and additionally modulated by abnormal hydro-meteorological conditions and vegetation types. Hence, isolating and quantifying vegetation physiological responses to drought enables a better understanding of ecosystem biogeochemical and biophysical feedback in modulating climate change.

TI  - A image fusion and U-Net approach to improving crop planting structure multi-category classification in irrigated area
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Some subtle features of planting structures in irrigation areas could only be visible on high-resolution panchromatic spectral images. However, low spatial resolution multispectral image makes it hard to recognize them. It is challenging to accurately obtain crop planting structure when using traditional methods. This paper proposes an extraction method of crop planting structure based on image fusion and U-Net depth semantic segmentation network, which can automatically and accurately extract multi-category crop planting structure information. This method takes Landsat8 commercial multispectral satellite data set as an example, chooses RGB pseudo-color synthetic image which highlights vegetation characteristics, and uses HLS(Hue, Luminance, Saturation), NND(Nearest-Neighbor Diffusion) and G-S(Gram-Schmidt) methods to fuse panchromatic band to obtain 15m high-resolution fusion image to obtain training set and test set, six types of land features including cities and rivers were labeled by manual to obtain the verification set. The training and validation sets are cut and enhanced to train the U-Net semantic segmentation network. Taking the Xiaokaihe irrigation area in Binzhou City, Shandong Province, China, as an example, the planting structure was classified, and the overall accuracy was 87.7%, 91.2%, and 91.3%, respectively. The accuracy of crop planting structures (wheat, cotton, woodland) was 74.2%, 82.5%, 82.3%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.832, 0.880, and 0.881, respectively. The results showed that the NND-UNet method was suitable for large-scale continuous crop types (wheat, cotton), and the GS-UNet method had a better classification effect in discrete areas of cash crops (Jujube and many kinds of fruit trees).

TI  - Extraction of Winter Wheat Planting Area Based on Multi-Scale Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is difficult to accurately identify the winter wheat acreage in the Jianghuai region of China, and the fusion of high-resolution images and medium-resolution image data can improve the image quality and facilitate the identification and acreage extraction of winter wheat. Therefore, the objective of this study is to improve the accuracy of China's medium-spatial resolution image data (environment and disaster monitoring and forecasting satellite data, HJ-1/CCD) in extracting the large area of winter wheat planted. The fusion and object-oriented classification of the 30 m x 30 m HJ-1/CCD multispectral image and 2 m x 2 m GF-1 panchromatic image (GF-1/PMS) of winter wheat at the jointing stage in the study area were studied. The GF-1/PMS panchromatic images were resampled at 8 m, 16 m and 24 m to produce panchromatic images with four spatial resolutions, including 2 m. They were fused with HJ-1/CCD multispectral images by Gram Schmidt (GS). The quality of the fused images was evaluated to pick adequate scale images for the field pattern of winter wheat cultivation in the study area. The HJ-1/CCD multispectral image was resampled to obtain an image with the same scale as the suitable scale fused image. In the two images, the training samples SFI (samples of fused image) and SRI (samples of resampled image) containing spectral and texture information were selected. The fused image (FI) and resampled image (RI) were used for winter wheat acreage extraction using an object-oriented classification method. The results indicated that the fusion effect of 16 m x 16 m fused image was better than 2 m x 2 m, 8 m x 8 m and 24 m x 24 m fused images, with mean, standard deviation, average gradient and correlation coefficient values of 161.15, 83.01, 4.55 and 0.97, respectively. After object-oriented classification, the overall accuracy of SFI for the classification of resampled image RI16m was 92.22%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.90. The overall accuracy of SFI for the classification of fused image FI16m was 94.44%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.93. The overall accuracy of SRI for the classification of resampled image RI16m was 84.44%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.80. The classification effect of SFI for the fused image FI16m was the best, indicating that the object-oriented classification method combined with the fused image and the extraction samples of the fused image (SFI) could extract the winter wheat planting area with precision. In addition, the object-oriented classification method combining resampled images and the extraction samples of fused images (SFI) could extract the winter wheat planting area more effectively. These results indicated that the combination of medium spatial resolution HJ-1/CCD images and high spatial resolution GF-1 satellite images could effectively extract the planting area information of winter wheat in large regions.

TI  - SAR-TSCC: A Novel Approach for Long Time Series SAR Image Change Detection and Pattern Analysis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection has played an increasingly important role in multitemporal remote sensing applications recently. Long time series analysis is providing new information of land cover changes and improving the quality and accuracy of the change information being derived from remote sensing. The purpose of this study is to dig for more change temporal information and change pattern information from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image time series (ITS), which is of great significance for monitoring urban area changes, conducting land use surveys, and renovating illegal constructions. In the study, a novel unified framework for long time series SAR image change detection and change pattern analysis (SAR-TSCC) was proposed for land cover change mapping. To obtain the most notable change time rapidly, a fast SAR ITS change point search method based on pruned exact linear time (SAR-PELT) algorithm was adopted. Meanwhile, the deep time series classification network, named SAR time series transformer (SAR-TST), was implemented to recognize the change patterns, which is based on time series transformer (TST) architecture. Considering the lack of real training data, a novel synthetic data generation method is developed. The combination of the synthetic and real data enhanced the generalization of the classifiers. The proposed framework was used for monitoring a large urbanization area in the northwest of Hong Kong, China. The Cosmo Skymed (CSK) time series data acquired from 2013 to 2020 were exploited for land cover change analysis. Experiment results showed that our approach achieved the state-of-the-art performance, as the time accuracy reached 86% and the classification accuracy on the four main change patterns (impulse, step, cycle, and complex) is over 99%. In particular, the proposed SAR-TST model showed remarkable advantages in the presence of insufficient real data.

TI  - An Effective Multimodel Fusion Method for SAR and Optical Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images acquired by different sensors exhibit different characteristics due to their distinct imaging mechanisms. The fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing images is valuable for specific remote sensing image applications, as it enables the extraction of texture features from SAR images while preserving the spectral information of optical images. Several existing fusion approaches have been proposed in recent years, including the Nonsubsampled Shearlet Transform Pulse Coupled Neural Network (NSST-PCNN), which is a typical and effective fusion method. However, it suffers from the inconsistency in regional edge information. To address this issue, we propose a new method called MS-NSST-PCNN for multi-model fusion of SAR and optical remote sensing images. This method incorporates the multiScale morphological gradient (MSMG) into NSST-PCNN to detect edges and enhance the utilization of edge characteristics. The fusion results of two polarization modes, VV and VH are evaluated in combination with existing methods, using image fusion accuracy and visual interpretation criteria. The results demonstrate that for Sentinel 1 and Landsat 8 OLI image fusion the proposed MS-NSST-PCNN method achieves higher correlation coefficients and lower spectral distortion with VV polarization compared to traditional methods in two study areas. Moreover, the proposed method also exhibits better performance for GF3 and GF2 images with higher spatial resolution. In subsequent applications of land classification in urban and rural scenarios, the fusion results of the proposed method achieve higher accuracy than those of other fusion methods or source images applied directly.

TI  - Intercomparison of Automated Near-Real-Time Flood Mapping Algorithms Using Satellite Data and DEM-Based Methods: A Case Study of 2022 Madagascar Flood
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous algorithms have been developed to automate the process of delineating water surface maps for flood monitoring and mitigation purposes by using multiple sources such as satellite sensors and digital elevation model (DEM) data. To better understand the causes of inaccurate mapping information, we aim to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of these algorithms through a case study of the 2022 Madagascar flooding event. The HYDRAFloods toolbox was used to perform preprocessing, image correction, and automated flood water detection based on the state-of-the-art Edge Otsu, Bmax Otsu, and Fuzzy Otsu algorithms for the satellite images; the FwDET tool was deployed upon the cloud computing platform (Google Earth Engine) for rapid estimation of flood area/depth using the digital elevation model (DEM) data. Generated surface water maps from the respective techniques were evaluated qualitatively against each other and compared with a reference map produced by the European Union Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS). The DEM-based maps show generally overestimated flood extents. The satellite-based maps show that Edge Otsu and Bmax Otsu methods are more likely to generate consistent results than those from Fuzzy Otsu. While the synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data are typically favorable over the optical image under undesired weather conditions, maps generated based on SAR data tend to underestimate the flood extent as compared with reference maps. This study also suggests the newly launched Landsat-9 serves as an essential supplement to the rapid delineation of flood extents.

TI  - Measuring the Greening Level of Construction Land in Rural Communities from the Perspective of Multi-Functions Using a Green Niche Method
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Green utilization of rural construction land (RCL) is key to implementing the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and rural revitalization both in China and other countries. However, how to systematically analyze the green utilization level of RCL is still unclear. Thus, a novel method, the green niche of construction land functions in rural communities (GNCLFRC), was proposed based on ecological niche theory to measure the greening level of the RCL. From a systematic perspective, two aspects and five dimensions were proposed for consideration when analyzing GNCLFRC. One was the green niche of elements (GNE), including the greenness of social, economic, and environmental functions. The other was the green niche of state (GNS), including coupling coordination and the development location and potential of the functional system. The Yanhe Community, as a typical case at the microscale for rural revitalization and green utilization of RCL in China, was selected for an empirical application to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. Five Worldview satellite images with resolutions of 0.5 m in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 and field investigation data obtained by using UAV, iRTK, and Qstar in 2018 and 2020 were used to analyze changes in the RCL and its functions in Yanhe. The two aspects and five dimensions were analyzed. The results showed that GNE in Yanhe continuously increased by 0.3057 to 0.9131 from 2008 to 2020, while GNS increased and then decreased from 2016 to 2020. However, the GNS remained between 0.8-0.9. The GNCLFRC increased yearly and remained above 0.9 for many years. The results indicate that the greening level of RCL in Yanhe is improving, which boosts its overall green development capacity and regional competitiveness. Moreover, the GNCLFRC analysis method and results can be used to guide the green utilization planning of RCL, green function-oriented regional zoning in rural areas, and green management of rural construction.

TI  - Dynamic and attribution analysis of sandy lands in the Beijing-Tianjin sandstorm source region during 2000-2018
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - China launched the "Beijing-Tianjin Sandstorm Source Control Project" (BTSSCP) in 2000 to alleviate the negative effects of sandstorms in Beijing, Tianjin, and their surrounding areas. Restoration of sandy lands was a key priority of this project. Since the project would end in 2022, assessing the spatiotemporal changes of sandy lands and their main driving factors since 2000 is of great significance for evaluating the benefits of the project and guiding future scientific planning and governance. In this study, we employed object-oriented-based image segmentation, decision tree classification, and change vector analysis to establish a sandy land monitoring framework based on a series of Landsat datasets, and obtained sandy land distribution maps for 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2018. Moreover, the dynamics of the different sandy land types in different periods were studied and analyzed, and their characteristics were summarized. Finally, the driving factors were obtained by integrating land use changes and actual and potential productivity trends to identify the contribution of human activities and natural factors to sandy land dynamics during 2000-2018. The overall classification accuracy was as high as 89.30%, indicating that our proposed monitoring framework could accurately acquire information on sandy land distribution. The results showed that sandy land areas continued to decrease during 2000-2018 at an average rate of 323.94 km(2) per year, while the decrease rate was as high as 865.33 km(2) per year during 2015-2018 (i.e., this decrease rate nearly tripled over the entire study period). Further, the sandy land type generally showed a shift towards the direction of decreasing desertification. The most obvious changes were a decrease in mobile sandy lands and an increase in cultivated sandy lands, with relative change ratios of 18.52% and 47.47%, respectively, from 2000 to 2018. In-depth analysis showed that approximately 56.89% of the mobile sandy land was converted to semi-fixed sandy land, while 27.57% of the fixed sandy land was converted to cultivated sandy land. Human activities along with natural factors were the main driving factors of changes in sandy lands, accounting for 52.49% and 29.74%, respectively, and the changes dominated by natural factors were less than 1%. These results indicated that the BTSSCP was effective in restoring sandy lands from 2000 to 2018. Nonetheless, sandy lands had been significantly reduced and reclaimed; additionally, mobile sandy lands persisted in a large area, and degradation was prevalent to a certain extent. Hence, we strongly recommend the continuation of the project to significantly reduce mobile sandy lands in the future.

TI  - In-Orbit Geometric Calibration for Long-Linear-Array and Wide-Swath Whisk-Broom TIS of SDGSAT-1
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the imaging mechanism complexity of long-linear-array and wide-swath whisk-broom thermal infrared spectrometer (TIS) of the first Sustainable Development Goals Satellite (SDGSAT-1), how to achieve a high geometric positioning accuracy (GPA) becomes the core factor in subsequent geometric quantitative applications. Here, in this article, a three-step in-orbit geometric calibration (GC) strategy comprising the estimations of exterior orientation parameters (EOPs), interior orientation parameters (IOPs), and scanning compensation parameters (SCPs) is proposed to correct the geo-location displacements for whisk-broom TIS. First, in accordance with the optical-mechanical structure and pinhole imaging theory, we establish the rigorous geometric positioning model (RGPM) of TIS and analyze the error resources term-by-term along the error propagation link elaborately. Second, the corresponding rigorous geometric calibration model (RGCM) is constructed in detail based on the 2-D look-angle model and the generalized bias correction matrix. Especially for eliminating the systematic non-linear errors in the scanning direction, a fifth-degree polynomial is put forward to be employed to fit and compensate for the angular measurement errors of the scanning mirror. Finally, a three-step estimation method is presented to estimate the calibration parameters with ground control points (GCPs). Experimental results based on the spatial references of Landsat 8 panchromatic images and version 2 of advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) global digital elevation model (GDEM2) show that the GPA of the proposed method in along-track and cross-track directions can be better than 1.0 pixels for all three bands, which makes a great sense for associated geometric measurements.

TI  - Reponses of Land Surface Albedo to Global Vegetation Greening: An Analysis Using GLASS Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global vegetation greening during recent decades has been observed from various remote sensing data. The global and regional climate can be altered by an increase in carbon storage, as well as changes in land surface albedo (LSA) and evaporation. However, the LSA changes induced by global vegetation greening are still not clear, and contrasting responses of LSA to vegetation changes were reported in previous studies. In this study, we analyzed the LSA in response to global vegetation greening using the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) data and a vegetation-induced LSA change model. The results showed that vegetation greening trends could be observed worldwide, which resulted in contrasting LSA responses at regional scales (LSA increased as leaf area index (LAI) increased, or LSA decreased as LAI increased). Moreover, these contrasting LSA responses to global vegetation greening were effectively explained by the albedo difference between a vegetation and soil background. The results provide new insights into the relationship between LSA changes and global vegetation dynamics, and can support recommendations for policies of vegetation protection, and large-scale afforestation and deforestation.

TI  - A Spatio-Temporal Fusion Framework of UAV and Satellite Imagery for Winter Wheat Growth Monitoring
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and continuous monitoring of crop growth is vital for the development of precision agriculture. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite platforms have considerable complementarity in high spatial resolution (centimeter-scale) and fixed revisit cycle. It is meaningful to optimize the cross-platform synergy for agricultural applications. Considering the characteristics of UAV and satellite platforms, a spatio-temporal fusion (STF) framework of UAV and satellite imagery is developed. It includes registration, radiometric normalization, preliminary fusion, and reflectance reconstruction. The proposed STF framework significantly improves the fusion accuracy with both better quantitative metrics and visualized results compared with four existing STF methods with different fusion strategies. Especially for the prediction of object boundary and spatial texture, the absolute values of Robert's edge (EDGE) and local binary pattern (LBP) decreased by a maximum of more than 0.25 and 0.10, respectively, compared with the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM). Moreover, the STF framework enhances the temporal resolution to daily, although the satellite imagery is discontinuous. Further, its application potential for winter wheat growth monitoring is explored. The daily synthetic imagery with UAV spatial resolution describes the seasonal dynamics of winter wheat well. The synthetic Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2) are consistent with the observations. However, the error in NDVI and EVI2 at boundary changes is relatively large, which needs further exploration. This research provides an STF framework to generate very dense and high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data at a low cost. It not only contributes to precision agriculture applications, but also is valuable for land-surface dynamic monitoring.

TI  - A Semi-Empirical Retrieval Method of Above-Ground Live Forest Fuel Loads by Combining SAR and Optical Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fuel load is the key factor for fire risk assessment, firefighting, and carbon emissions estimation. Remote sensing technology has distinct advantages in fuel load estimation due to its sensitivity to biomass and adequate spatiotemporal observations for large scales. Many related works applied empirical methods with individual satellite observation data to estimate fuel load, which is highly conditioned on local data and limited by saturation problems. Here, we combined optical data (i.e., Landsat 7 ETM+) and spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (i.e., ALOS PALSAR) in a proposed semi-empirical retrieval model to estimate above-ground live forest fuel loads (FLAGL). Specifically, optical data was introduced into water cloud model (WCM) to compensate for vegetation coverage information. For comparison, we also evaluated the performance of single spaceborne L-band SAR data (i.e., ALOS PALSAR) in fuel load estimation with common WCM. The above two comparison experiments were both validated by field measurements (i.e., BioSAR-2008) and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method. WCM with single SAR data could achieve reasonable performance (R-2 = 0.64 or higher and RMSEr = 35.3% or lower) but occurred an underestimation problem especially in dense forests. The proposed method performed better with R-2 increased by 0.05-0.13 and RMSEr decreased by 5.8-12.9%. We also found that the underestimation problem (i.e., saturation problem) was alleviated even when vegetation coverage reached 65% or the total FLAGL reached about 183 Tons/ha. We demonstrated our FLAGL estimation method by validation in an open-access dataset in Sweden.

TI  - Analysis of the Evolution of Mangrove Landscape Patterns and Their Drivers in Hainan Island from 2000 to 2020
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological services provided by mangroves are of great value and significance in regard of the achievement of the major strategic goals of carbon neutrality and the carbon peak. Here, we first evaluated the uses of five machine learning methods combined with Sentinal-2A data band features to identify and extract mangrove forests in Dongzhai Harbor, northeast Hainan Province, China. Then, the XGBoost algorithm with the highest accuracy was selected to identify and extract information on mangrove forests on Hainan Island, focusing on five periods from 2000 to 2020. The landscape pattern index, dynamic attitude model, and mathematical statistics were integrated to analyze trends over this 20-year period. The results revealed the following: (1) The total mangrove landscape area of Hainan Island between 2000 and 2020 showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing. In the past 20 years, the mangrove area has increased by 1315.75 ha, with an annual change rate of 65.79 ha/a. (2) From 2000 to 2020, the mangroves in Hainan Island were characterized by increased fragmentation, increased heterogeneity, decreased connectivity, and increased richness, while proportion of each landscape type tends to be equilibrated. (3) Natural factors such as the annual average temperature in the study area were the main factors driving the large-scale reduction in mangroves and the deepening of landscape fragmentation, followed by human factors, and the impact of macro-policies cannot be ignored. The results of this study can provide a significant reference for future remote sensing data extraction from mangrove forests and their ecological protection and restoration on Hainan Island.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatial and Temporal Evolution of Urban Resilience in Four Southern Regions of Xinjiang.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Resilience theory plays a pivotal role in promoting sustainable urban development and the long-term stable development of the national economy. Based on the "scale-density-form" model of urban resilience, this paper shifts the perspective of urban resilience from the eastern region with higher level of economic development and better infrastructure construction to the arid northwest region with more fragile ecological environment and weaker urban development potential, which enriches the connotation and mechanism of urban resilience to a certain extent. Using ArcGIS platforms, statistical data and remote sensing data as data sources, this paper analyzes the urban resilience of four southern Xinjiang regions (Aksu Administrative Office, Kashgar Administrative Office, Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture and Hotan Administrative Office) in time and space from 2000 to 2020 using a three-dimensional resilience analysis framework based on scale, density and morphology. The results show that the urban de-development of the study area faces a strong scale safety constraint due to the small available land area in the study area, which leads to its small urban construction land area. The county- and city-scale elasticity levels of Aksu Administrative Office and Kashgar Administrative Office are higher than the average level of the study area, while most of the counties and cities in Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture and Hotan Administrative Office are lower than the average level of the study area, with large differences between counties and cities. The geographical location of the study area determines the backwardness of the region in terms of ideology, production methods and technology, which seriously restricts the development of local society and economy. In terms of density resilience, there are large differences among counties and cities in the study area, and the density resilience of Aksu, Kashgar and Kucha is much higher than that of other counties and cities. In terms of morphological resilience, with the increasing prominence of ecological status, the urban landscape layout of the study area has changed significantly, leading to changes in the distance between its blue-green landscape and gray-white landscape, which in turn causes changes in morphological resilience. Based on the above findings, initiatives and paths for resilience regulation in the study area are proposed in terms of scale, density and morphology. The study also has a reference value for local urban safety development.

TI  - Satellite prediction of coastal hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing number, size, and frequency of coastal hypoxia increasingly threaten marine ecosystem health and essential ecosystem services for human well-being. It is therefore urgent to use continuous and consistent observation and develop advanced tools to characterize and track the spatial and temporal change of coastal hypoxia. Satellite imagery with fine spatiotemporal resolution and global coverage has shown great potential for monitoring environmental changes, yet has rarely been applied to hypoxia mapping. To advance the understanding, we synthesized satellite-derived ocean color variables and dissolved oxygen measurements collected during 2014, and used random forest regression, lagged linear regression, and functional data analysis to estimate the spatiotemporal change of the hypoxia zone in the Gulf of Mexico. The three models achieved similar predictive accuracy (+/- 1.2-1.4 mg/L dissolved oxygen), but the random forest regression performed the best in estimating the bottom dissolved oxygen from satellite-derived variables. Our models also revealed time lags of roughly 0-5 and 16-19 days between the surface water process (e.g., algae bloom and ocean warming) and bottom water hypoxia, which was rarely considered in previous hypoxia studies using satellite data. Finally, our models showed that the area of Gulf hypoxia increased gradually from May and reached a peak during mid-July and mid-August in 2014, and the hypoxia zone occurred in the estuary of the Mississippi River and Suwannee River during roughly 25% of summer days. In addition to predicting the size of hypoxic zones, our study provides additional information on where, when, and how long hypoxic zones persist with greater spatial details and enables modeling hypoxic zones at near-real-time (e.g., days) temporal scales. More importantly, we demonstrate the great potential of applying satellite remote sensing for spatially explicit hypoxia mapping, which could promote more cost-effective coastal hypoxia monitoring and assessment practices.

TI  - Evaluation of Reflectance and Canopy Scattering Coefficient Based Vegetation Indices to Reduce the Impacts of Canopy Structure and Soil in Estimating Leaf and Canopy Chlorophyll Contents
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll is of great physiological and ecological significance. Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) can be retrieved from remotely sensed data based on vegetation indices (VIs). However, the impacts of canopy structure and soil remain open problems. VIs are typically calculated from spectral reflectance. In this study, we also constructed and examined VIs based on canopy scattering coefficients (W lambda) from spectral invariants theory. Based on extensive leaf and canopy radiative transfer simulations, linear regression and artificial neural network models were built with reflectance-based and W lambda -based VIs to retrieve LCC and CCC. The results showed that the canopy structure and soil significantly affected the retrievals. W lambda can effectively suppress the impacts of the leaf angle distribution (LAD) but not the leaf area index (LAI). The W lambda, estimated as the ratio reflectance/directional area scattering factor (DASF), contained a large error when the soil effect was strong. The W lambda -based VIs did not yield very accurate results in LCC estimation but exhibited higher accuracy for CCC estimation compared to reflectance-based VIs. Of all the VIs investigated, the best VI was D99 [(R-850- R-710)/( R-850- R-680)] for LCC and Wmul (W-749 x W-956) for CCC. Compared to D99 for LCC, Wmul for CCC was less accurate, and the accuracy varied more among canopies with different LADs. The main reason was that CCC equals LCC multiplied by LAI, but LCC and LAI impact VIs in a similar manner.

TI  - A Robust Framework for Resolution Enhancement of Land Surface Temperature by Combining Spatial Downscaling and Spatiotemporal Fusion Methods
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) products with high spatial resolution and short revisiting cycles are crucial for environmental studies. However, due to the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite observations, such data are not directly available. Spatial downscaling and spatiotemporal fusion methods are the existing solutions for this problem, but their robustness is limited under different surface conditions. Here, we propose a Robust Framework for Combining Downscaling and spatiotemporal Fusion methods to generate the synthesized daily high-resolution LST with high accuracy in different landscapes. RFCDF introduces a novel weighting strategy that determines pixel-level weights using an empirical function under the constraint of the image-level weights of two predictions. We implement the framework using the thermal sharpening algorithm (TsHARP) and spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) with Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in Beijing and Baotou, as well as Landsat 8 and simulated coarse resolution imagery in nine subregions with different surface landscapes in Beijing. Our results demonstrate that RFCDF can generate more accurate estimations and preserve more spatial details than either individual or combination methods, improving accuracy by 0.1-0.6 and 0.4-1.3 K in the two study areas, respectively. Moreover, the proposed framework is robust, reducing the root mean square error of estimations by 8%-24% under different surface conditions. RFCDF can also generate dense high-resolution LST time series, which is crucial for studying the surface thermal environment at a finer scale.

TI  - Progressive Task-Based Universal Network for Raw Infrared Remote Sensing Imagery Ship Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Infrared remote sensing images are becoming increasingly popular due to their superior penetration and resistance to light interference. However, challenges still remain when applying them in real-world applications: 1) raw infrared images suffer from severe stripes interference and the preprocessing techniques used to obtain standard image products for subsequent detection tasks tend to be time-consuming, which fails to meet the application requirements; 2) current destriping techniques may inevitably weaken the local contrast between some objects and the local background since they need to consider the gray consistency of the overall image; and 3) in low-resolution images, dim and small infrared targets are challenging to discriminate, resulting in high false alarms. To address these challenges, we proposed a progressive task-based universal network for raw infrared image ship detection while simultaneously removing stripes. First, we built an integrated network consisting of two components: the stripe denoising component (SDC) and the object detection component (ODC). We also designed a feedback loss adjustment mechanism to enhance the focus of the SDC on the target area. Second, a directed two-branch network was constructed for efficient stripe noise removal, including an x direction branch for feature enhancement and a y-direction branch for grayscale smoothing. Finally, a parallel network with two labels was designed to extract the inherent features of the target and the background, as well as their relationship features, to achieve refined ship detection. We conducted experiments on a self-assembled dataset from the GaoFen-1 satellite to validate our approach. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in infrared image ship detection.

TI  - Retrieval of 2-D Ocean Total Surface Current From Sentinel-1 Doppler Frequency Shift Using 2-D Kalman Filtering
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has all-weather, all-day, large-area observation capability and can measure ocean total surface currents with Doppler frequency shift. However, conventional SAR can only obtain the radial velocity of the ocean's total surface current. In this letter, we propose a method for inverting ocean total surface current vectors using a 2-D Kalman filter and a priori information about ocean current fields from ocean surface current analyses real-time (OSCAR). We establish a complete filtering process including filter creation, filtering path selection, and fusion of filtering results. We construct the Kalman filter according to the motion characteristics of ocean currents and transform the ocean surface current vector inversion problem into a filtering problem. The introduction of 2-D filtering can better adapt to the directionality of ocean currents. Furthermore, we design the filtering path to obtain smoother filtering results. To synthesize the filtering results of different filtering paths, we use the covariance intersection (CI) fusion method in distributed fusion to obtain the final ocean current vector inversion results. The accuracy of the inversion is verified by the measured data. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed method with the mean Doppler error of 5.43 Hz is 0.182 m/s at eastward speed and 0.141 m/s at northward speed. The reduction is 0.009 and 0.029 m/s against OSCAR.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth and Space - From Infrared to Terahertz (ESIT)
CL  - Nantong, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is a key parameter for monitoring the ocean environment and understanding various ocean phenomena, and is a key indicator of climate change. Satellite remote sensing data is an important technical tool for SST research, but the availability of data is reduced due to the influence of clouds and aerosols, which generate a large amount of missing data. The data interpolation empirical orthogonal function (DINEOF) method has usability and accuracy in reconstructing missing grid points of remote sensing datasets. In this study, we use a convolutional self-encoder neural network, modified for model skip connection and fully connected layers, and introduce an attention mechanism to extract spatio-temporal features of SST data, called attention data interpolation convolutional autoencoder (A-DINCAE), to achieve the reconstruction of infrared radiometer SST data and compare A-DINCAE with DINCAE and DINEOF Reconstruction accuracy. The accuracy of the reconstruction results is quantitatively evaluated using cross-validation datasets and actual measurement data, and the study area is selected as the South China Sea with the boundaries of 103-121 degrees E and 0-23 degrees N. The validation results show that the reconstruction effect of the A-DINCAE model on the SST missing data is better than that of DINCAE, the accuracy of the reconstruction results is much higher than that of DINEOF, and the reconstruction results restore the main SST of the sea area physical features of the sea area. This paper confirms that the attention mechanism can improve the DINCAE spatio-temporal feature extraction ability, and the small-scale features of the missing data are restored under the same data reconstruction conditions, and the A-DINCAE is more efficient than DINEOF, and The accuracy of the improved model has been improved.

TI  - Land-use intensity impacts habitat selection of ground-nesting farmland birds in The Netherlands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural intensification has modified grassland habitats, causing serious declines in farmland biodiversity including breeding birds. Until now, it has been difficult to objectively evaluate the link between agricultural land-use intensity and range requirements of wild populations at the landscape scale.In this study of Black-tailed Godwits Limosa limosa, we examined habitat selection and home range size during the breeding phase in relation to land-use intensity, at the scale of the entire Netherlands. From 2013 to 2019, 57 breeding godwits were tracked with solar-Platform Transmitter Terminals (26-216 locations [mean: 80] per bird per breeding phase) and used to estimate their core (50%) and home ranges (90%). Of these, 37 individuals were instrumented in Iberia and therefore unbiased toward eventual breeding locations. The tracks were used to analyse habitat selection by comparing the mean, median and standard deviation of land-use intensity of core and home ranges with matching iterated random samples of increasing radii, that is, 500 m (local), 5 km (neighbourhood), 50 km (region) and the whole of The Netherlands.Land-use intensities of the core and home ranges selected by godwits were similar to those at the local and neighbourhood scales but were significantly lower and less variable than those of the region and the entire country. Thus, at the landscape scale, godwits were selected for low-intensity agricultural land.The core range size of godwits increased with increasing land-use intensity, indicating high agricultural land-use intensity necessitating godwits to use larger areas.This is consistent with the idea that habitat quality declines with increasing land-use intensity. This study is novel as it examines nationwide habitat selection and space use of a farmland bird subspecies tracked independently of breeding locations. Dutch breeding godwits selected areas with lower land-use intensity than what was generally available. The majority of the Dutch agricultural grassland (94%) is managed at high land-use intensity, which heavily restricts the viability of breeding possibilities for ground-nesting birds. The remote sensing methodology described here illustrates the potential to study entire wild populations from the local field level to their whole spatial range.

TI  - Space Geodetic Views on the 2021 Central Greece Earthquake Sequence: 2D Deformation Maps Decomposed From Multi-Track and Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 InSAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pioneering efforts well studied the deformation decomposition of single earthquake using a pair of ascending (ASC) and descending (DES) track interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. However, deformation decomposition of sequent events is rarely discussed and hard to implement. That's because it's hard to ensure deformations related to each earthquake can be recorded by a pair of ASC and DES track data. Three sequent earthquakes (Mw>5.5) just hit Central Greece in March 2021, and this earthquake sequence provides us with a perfect case to study 2-D (east-west and up-down) deformation decomposition when the mentioned premise cannot be satisfied. In this context, we proposed a Multi-track and Multi-temporal 2-D (MTMT2-D) method. Its novelty and behind rationale are to decompose 2-D deformations of each event through fusing multitrack and multitemporal interferograms. Based on the decomposed deformations, we invert the slip distribution of three earthquakes respectively. We found that the decomposed deformations can better constrain the fault geometry than the single InSAR interferogram. Furthermore, our geodetic inversion results also suggest a domino-like triggering rupture process for this earthquake sequence. It indicates that our MTMT2-D method can potentially reveal more details about earthquake sequence.

M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is one of the important parameters in Earth system models. In recent years, the retrieval based on machine learning and data fusion of multisource satellite observation data has become one of the effective methods to obtain soil moisture information at a large scale. However, most retrieval studies need to download remote sensing original data first, then preprocess, train the retrieval models, and finally generate products in the offline environment. In order to meet the requirements of long temporal series of largescale area retrieval, and with the widespread use of machine learning in retrieval studies, the amount of remote sensing data and necessary computing resources are gradually increasing. Moreover, studies usually use a single machine learning retrieval model for the entire study area, which lacks the consideration of geographical differences and spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture. Therefore, we established a geo-intelligent soil moisture retrieval framework completely based on the cloud environment. In this study, a variety of machine learning algorithms were used to fuse multisource observation data mainly including Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and other auxiliary data, and the Continental United States (CONUS) was taken as the experimental area to generate soil moisture data with a resolution of 500 m. In addition, this study combines geographical correlation with machine learning models to cope with the spatial heterogeneity of surface soil moisture (SSM). Overall, based on site-based validation, the retrieval model trained under the framework performed well, with an estimation accuracy of 0.716 and 0.0383 m3.m-3 in terms of coefficient of determination (R2) and unbiased root mean-square error (ubRMSE). The establishment of the cloud retrieval framework provides convenience for the whole retrieval process and also provides a new idea for other retrieval studies of geoscience parameters.

TI  - Multi-Level Dynamic Analysis of Landscape Patterns of Chinese Megacities during the Period of 2016-2021 Based on a Spatiotemporal Land-Cover Classification Model Using High-Resolution Satellite Imagery: A Case Study of Beijing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In today's accelerating urbanization process, timely and effective monitoring of land-cover dynamics, landscape pattern analysis, and evaluation of built-up urban areas (BUAs) have important research significance and practical value for the sustainable development, planning and management, and ecological protection of cities. High-spatial-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images have the advantages of high-accuracy Earth observations, covering a large area, and having a short playback period, and they can objectively and accurately provide fine dynamic spatial information about the land cover in urban built-up areas. However, the complexity and comprehensiveness of the urban structure have led to a single-scale analysis method, which makes it difficult to accurately and comprehensively reflect the characteristics of the BUA landscape pattern. Therefore, in this study, a joint evaluation method for an urban land-cover spatiotemporal-mapping chain and multi-scale landscape pattern using high-resolution remote sensing imagery was developed. First, a pixel-object-knowledge model with temporal and spatial classifications was proposed for the spatiotemporal mapping of urban land cover. Based on this, a multi-scale district-BUA-city block-land cover type map of the city was established and a joint multi-scale evaluation index was constructed for the multi-scale dynamic analysis of the urban landscape pattern. The accuracies of the land cover in 2016 and 2021 were 91.9% and 90.4%, respectively, and the kappa coefficients were 0.90 and 0.88, respectively, indicating that the method can provide effective and reliable information for spatial mapping and landscape pattern analysis. In addition, the multi-scale analysis of the urban landscape pattern revealed that, during the period of 2016-2021, Beijing maintained the same high urbanization rate in the inner part of the city, while the outer part of the city kept expanding, which also reflects the validity and comprehensiveness of the analysis method developed in this study.

TI  - CADUI: Cross-Attention-Based Depth Unfolding Iteration Network for Pansharpening Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is an important technology for remote sensing imaging systems to obtain high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. It mainly obtains HRMS images with uniform spectral distribution and rich spatial details by fusing low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images and high spatial resolution panchromatic (PAN) images. Therefore, how to extract features completely and reconstruct images with high quality is critical to obtain ideal fusion images. In this article, we propose a new pansharpening method, called the Cross-Attention-based Depth Unfolding Iteration network for pansharpening remote sensing images (CADUI), which achieves the desired fusion effect by iteratively optimizing the deep prior regularization and combining it with a cross-attention mechanism. The network consists of two parts: optimized iterations of deep prior regularization (DEIN-Block) and cross-attention mechanism (CAFM-Block). Among them, DEIN-Block introduces the depth prior as an implicit regularization and improves the adaptability and representation ability of the relevant data of the reconstructed image through iteration. CAFM-Block realizes dual-branch fusion through cross-attention fusion and channel-attention fusion to achieve better fusion results. Simulation experiments and real experiments are carried out on the standard datasets: QuickBird (QB) and WorldView-2 (WV2). Through quantitative comparison and qualitative analysis, it is proven that the method is superior to the existing methods.

TI  - Smart plugging and low-damage foam drilling fluid technology for CBM drilling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OIL GAS AND COAL TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Once the drilling fluid filtrate invades along microfractures of coal reservoirs during the drilling process, it can cause notable wall instability. Foam spheres would infiltrate and move through the pores and into the fractures under drilling differential pressure between the wellbore and formation. As a result, microfoams deformed and the volume became larger to achieve plugging. In order to improve the foam foaming performance and stability during drilling, thereby enhancing the plugging effect, a new type of anionic Gemini surfactant, ZY-1, was designed and synthesised. Not only did ZY-1 reduce surface tension but also the half-life of foams produced was more than three times that of conventional foaming agents. Furthermore, contact angle recovery rate of cores and the desorption rate of drilling fluid reached 86% and 88.24%, respectively. And the plugging rate and gas permeability recovery value after pollution were both above 90% for the developed low-damage drilling fluid.

TI  - A Method Based on Improved iForest for Trunk Extraction and Denoising of Individual Street Trees
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the street tree resource survey using Mobile laser scanning (MLS) represents a hot spot around the world. Refined trunk extraction is an essential step for 3D reconstruction of street trees. However, due to scanning errors and the effects of occlusion by various types of features in the urban environment, street tree point cloud data processing has the problem of excessive noise. For the noise points that are difficult to remove using statistical methods in close proximity to the tree trunk, we propose an adaptive trunk extraction and denoising method for street trees based on an improved iForest (Isolation Forest) algorithm. Firstly, to extract the individual tree trunk points, the trunk and the crown are distinguished from the individual tree point cloud through point cloud slicing. Next, the iForest algorithm is improved by conducting automatic calculation of the contamination and further used to denoise the tree trunk point cloud. Finally, the method is validated with five datasets of different scenes. The results indicate that our method is robust and effective in extracting and denoising tree trunks. Compared with the traditional Statistical Outlier Removal (SOR) filter and Radius filter denoising methods, the denoising accuracy of the proposed method can be improved by approximately 30% for noise points close to tree trunks. Compared to iForest, the proposed method automatically calculates the contamination, improving the automation of the algorithm. Our method can provide more precise trunk point clouds for 3D reconstruction of street trees.

TI  - Remote sensing monitoring of planting area of <i>Panax notoginseng</i>: A case study of Kaiyuan City in Honghe Prefecture
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Panax notoginseng is second only to ginseng Panax notoginseng in the Chinese traditional medicine industry. It has extremely high economic value and medicinal value. However, due to the unsustainable planting characteristics of P. notoginseng. The original planting area of P. notoginseng has been exhausted, so the planting area of P. notoginseng has gradually expanded to other areas, and the planting area of P. notoginseng is also changing. Based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI remote sensing image data from 2018 to 2021, the study used Google Earth engine and Random Forest classification to analyze the spatial distribution information of P. notoginseng planting areas in Kaiyuan City, Honghe Prefecture. The results show that, based on Sentinel-2 data, Landsat 8 OLI data, and other multisource data, comprehensively considering the image spectral characteristics and habitat characteristics of P. notoginseng, and applying the Random Forest classification method. The spatial distribution information of P. notoginseng planting areas can be quickly extracted. After calculation, the transfer matrix indicates that the accuracy of the results is high and can meet the requirements of research and application. According to the analysis of the results, the cultivated area of P. notoginseng showed no significant change in 2018 and 2019. It shows an increasing trend during this period. In 2020, the cultivated area of P. notoginseng decreased slightly. While in 2021, the cultivated area of P. notoginseng increased sharply, and the cultivated area of P. notoginseng was more than twice that of the previous year. However, the price of P. notoginseng has shown a trend of decline year by year. By monitoring the planting area of P. notoginseng and analyzing the relationship between the planting area and the price of P. notoginseng, we can predict the future market price of P. notoginseng and plan the rational planting of P. notoginseng.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Characteristics and Regional Variations of Active Fires in China since 2001
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, fires (e.g., biomass burning and/or straw burning) are still prevailing and serious globally. However, the issue of the characteristics, types, and drives of fire occurrence is always a challenge and varies distinctively worldwide. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 (C6) active fire products during 2001-2020, here, we analyzed the occurrence frequencies and spatiotemporal characteristics of active fires at the provincial and regional to national scales and at the monthly and annual scales in China. The accumulated occurrence frequencies of MODIS C6 active fires in China were up to 184.91 x 10(4) in the past two decades, and the average annual level was 9.25 x 10(4), especially in 2014 (15.20 x 10(4)). The overall trend of active fires was rising and then falling, but with significant spatial and temporal differences in the last 20-years. Temporally, nearly 61% of active fires occurred in spring (36%) and autumn (25%), particularly in August (16%), April (14%), and October (13%). Spatially, about 90% of active fires occurred in the east of the Hu Huanyong Line, particularly in Northeast China (25%), South China (23%), and East China (20%). In China, the most active fires were concentrated in the Northeast Plain, the North China Plain, the southeast hills, and the Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau. In terms of temporal differences across regions, active fires in Northeast China, North China, and Northwest China were concentrated in spring and autumn, especially in March, April, and October; in East China, they were concentrated in summer, especially in June; and in South China and Southwest China, they were concentrated in winter and spring, especially from December to April of the following year. Our study provides a full analysis of spatio-temporal characteristics and changes of active fires in China, and it can also assist in supplying a beneficial reference for higher monitoring and controlling of fires such as straw burning.

TI  - The Application of Compact Polarization Decomposition in the Construction of a Dual-Polarization Radar Index and the Effect Evaluation of Rape Extraction
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rape planting plots are fragmented and have the same temporal variation characteristics as other land types, the rape planting area is cloudy and rainy, and the optical remote sensing images are limited, all make it difficult to extract the rape planting areas. Aiming at the above-mentioned problems, this study used microwave remote sensing data combined with the compact polarimetric technique to construct a dual-polarization radar index to classify rape planting areas and analyzed the influence of time series combinations on the extraction accuracy of rape in South China. First, based on m-? compact polarimetric decomposition, a dual-polarization radar vegetation index (RVI) was constructed. Then, based on Sentinel-1 data, the dynamic time warping (DTW) threshold classification method was used to extract rape planting areas in six counties in the main rape-producing areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China. Finally, a random forest algorithm was used to analyze and screen the optimal time series combination of the extracted regional rape planting areas. Among the 94 rape samples obtained in the field, 74 samples were accurately classified as rape, and the overall accuracy was 78.72%. Six ground samples were used to verify the accuracy of the rape planting area extraction results, and the F-1 score was 81.00%. The above-mentioned results indicated that the rape planting area extraction approach based on the RVIm-? and DTW threshold classification methods yields high accuracy in regional rape planting area extraction from dual-polarization SAR data, and RVIm-? is characterized by certain regional scalability and stability.

TI  - XANet: An Efficient Remote Sensing Image Segmentation Model Using Element-Wise Attention Enhancement and Multi-Scale Attention Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Massive and diverse remote sensing data provide opportunities for data-driven tasks in the real world, but also present challenges in terms of data processing and analysis, especially pixel-level image interpretation. However, the existing shallow-learning and deep-learning segmentation methods, bounded by their technical bottlenecks, cannot properly balance accuracy and efficiency, and are thus hardly scalable to the practice scenarios of remote sensing in a successful way. Instead of following the time-consuming deep stacks of local operations as most state-of-the-art segmentation networks, we propose a novel segmentation model with the encoder-decoder structure, dubbed XANet, which leverages the more computationally economical attention mechanism to boost performance. Two novel attention modules in XANet are proposed to strengthen the encoder and decoder, respectively, namely the Attention Recalibration Module (ARM) and Attention Fusion Module (AFM). Unlike current attention modules, which only focus on elevating the feature representation power, and regard the spatial and channel enhancement of a feature map as two independent steps, ARM gathers element-wise semantic descriptors coupling spatial and channel information to directly generate a 3D attention map for feature enhancement, and AFM innovatively utilizes the cross-attention mechanism for the sufficient spatial and channel fusion of multi-scale features. Extensive experiments were conducted on ISPRS and GID datasets to comprehensively analyze XANet and explore the effects of ARM and AFM. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that XANet surpasses other state-of-the-art segmentation methods in both model performance and efficiency, as ARM yields a superior improvement versus existing attention modules with a competitive computational overhead, and AFM achieves the complementary advantages of multi-level features under the sufficient consideration of efficiency.

TI  - Quantifying aboveground biomass dynamics from charcoal degradation in Mozambique using GEDI Lidar and Landsat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding changes to aboveground biomass (AGB) in forests undergoing degradation is crucial for accurately and completely quantifying carbon emissions from forest loss and for environmental monitoring in the context of climate change. Monitoring forest degradation as compared to deforestation presents technical challenges because degradation involves widespread, low-intensity AGB removal under varying temporal dynamics. Charcoal production is a key driver for forest degradation in Africa and is projected to increase in the future years. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where charcoal production drives widespread ABG removal, the utility of optical remote sensing for degradation quantification is challenged by the large inter-seasonal variation and high complexities in ecosystem structure. Limited field measurements on tree structure and aboveground biomass density (AGBD) in many parts of the SSA also impose constraints. In this study, we present a novel data fusion approach combining 3D forest structure from NASA's GEDI Lidar with optical time-series data from Landsat to quantify biomass losses associated with charcoal-related forest degradation over a 10-year time period. We used machine learning models with Landsat spectral indices from the time period of limited hydric stress (LHS) as predictor variables. By applying the best performing Random Forest (RF) model to LandTrendrstabilized annual LHS Landsat composites, we produced annual forest AGBD maps from 2007 to 2019 over the Mabalane district in southern Mozambique where the dry forest ecosystem was under active charcoal-related degradation since 2008. The RF model achieved an RMSE value of 7.05 Mg/ha (RMSE% = 42%) and R2 value of 0.64 using a 10-fold cross-validation dataset. We quantified a total AGB loss of 2.12 & PLUSMN; 0.06 Megatons (Mt) over the 10-year period, which is only 6.35 & PLUSMN; 2.56% less than the total loss estimated using field-based data as previously published for the same area and time. In addition to quantifying biomass loss, we constructed annual AGBD maps that enabled the characterization of disturbance and recovery. Our framework demonstrates that fusing GEDI and Landsat data through predictive modeling can be used to quantify past forest AGBD dynamics in low biomass forests. This approach provides a satellite-based method to support REDD+ monitoring and evaluation activities in areas where field data is limited and has the potential to be extended to investigate a variety of different disturbance events.

TI  - Assessment on the Diurnal Cycle of Cloud Covers of Fengyun-4A Geostationary Satellite Based on the Manual Observation Data in China
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Complicated and regionally representative diurnal cycle characteristics of clouds may introduce some errors in the cloud mask (CLM) algorithm of the Geostationary (GEO) meteorological satellite imaging system, which are very difficult to be assessed by using analogous products of fixed-passing polar-orbiting satellites. In this investigation, the diurnal cycle of the performance of the CLM algorithm of the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager onboard the China Fengyun-4A satellite (FY-4A/AGRI) is validated by using manually observed cloud covers (CC) at 25 ground-based stations in China. The results indicate that the CCs calculated by the FY-4A/AGRI CLM algorithm are overestimated at 11:00 BJT (Beijing Time) and 14:00 BJT (around noon) and underestimated at 08:00 BJT and 20:00 BJT (in the morning and evening) at most stations. In summer, compared with other seasons, the CCs obtained from the FY-4A/AGRI over northern China and the Tibetan Plateau are much better, consistent with the manual observations, but the situation is the opposite in southern China. The CC results retrieved at the vegetation surface by FY-4A/AGRI, however, show the best and stable performance. Because of that, the two independent cloud tests induce most of the overestimations, and some sensitivity experiments for the CLM algorithm are conducted. The results show that the best improvement effect is achieved after only closing one cloud test using the $3.8\mu \text{m}$ band. Many extremely overestimated CC samples (about 56.3%) are eliminated. After that, the FY-4A/AGRI CLM product is more reasonable compared with the corresponding infrared and visible imageries.

T2  - Comprehensive R Archive Network
M3  - Software
AB  - Landsat satellites collect important data about global forest conditions. Documentation about Landsat's role in forest disturbance estimation is available at the site . By constrained quadratic B-splines, this package delivers an optimal shape-restricted trajectory to a time series of Landsat imagery for the purpose of modeling annual forest disturbance dynamics to behave in an ecologically sensible manner assuming one of seven possible "shapes", namely, flat, decreasing, one-jump (decreasing, jump up, decreasing), inverted vee (increasing then decreasing), vee (decreasing then increasing), linear increasing, and double-jump (decreasing, jump up, decreasing, jump up, decreasing). The main routine selects the best shape according to the minimum Bayes information criterion (BIC) or the cone information criterion (CIC), which is defined as the log of the estimated predictive squared error. The package also provides parameters summarizing the temporal pattern including year(s) of inflection, magnitude of change, pre- and post-inflection rates of growth or recovery. In addition, it contains routines for converting a flat map of disturbance agents to time-series disturbance maps and a graphical routine displaying the fitted trajectory of Landsat imagery.

TI  - Improvement of aerosol optical depth data for localized solar resource assessment
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar irradiance, especially for direct normal irradiance (DNI), is sensitive to the atmospheric aerosols, which can strongly extinguish DNI over areas with elevated aerosol loadings. The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB), developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), uses AOD from MERRA-2 reanalysis and is further downscaled from 0.5 degrees to 2-km based on elevation. However, the elevation-based downscaling may not accurately represent AOD, especially over the areas with large AOD gradients. This study examined whether the 1-km MODIS MAIAC satellite-retrieved AOD product can better represent the AOD distribution and be used to improve solar irradiance assessment. We focused on areas with relatively high AOD over North America (California, and New York City, US, and Mexico City in Mexico, in particular). The evaluation of MAIAC AOD and MERRA-2 AOD against ground-truth AERONET AOD shows that MAIAC AOD exhibits smaller RMSE by about 0.05 and higher correlation coefficient by 0.1-0.6 than MERRA-2 AOD. In addition, MERRA-2 AOD shows larger negative bias. The simulated DNI using MAIAC AOD (DNIMAIAC) and using MERRA-2 AOD (DNINSRDB) were evaluated with DNI observations. The results show the performance of DNIMAIAC is better than that of DNINSRDB with smaller RMSE by 0.5 -1.5%, smaller positive mean bias by 0.8 -3.1 % and comparable correlation for the 3 sites analyzed. Overall, 1-km MAIAC AOD shows higher accuracy than 2-km elevation-based MERRA-2 AOD, leading to better performance of the simulated DNI using MAIAC AOD. Therefore, 1-km MAIAC AOD can be used to improve the accuracy of solar resource assessment.

TI  - OBBStacking: An Ensemble Method for Remote Sensing Object Detection
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensemble methods are a reliable way to combine several models to achieve superior performance. However, research on the application of ensemble methods in the remote sensing object detection scenario is mostly overlooked. Two problems arise. First, one unique characteristic of remote sensing object detection is the oriented bounding boxes (OBB) of the objects and the fusion of multiple OBBs requires further research attention. Second, the widely used deep learning object detectors provide a score for each detected object as an indicator of confidence, but how to use these indicators effectively in an ensemble method remains a problem. Trying to address these problems, this article proposes OBBStacking, an ensemble method that is compatible with OBBs and combines the detection results in a learned fashion. This ensemble method helps take first place in the Challenge Track Fine-Grained Object Recognition in High-Resolution Optical Images, which was featured in 2021 Gaofen Challenge on Automated High-Resolution Earth Observation Image Interpretation. The experiments on DOTA dataset and FAIR1M dataset demonstrate the improved performance of OBBStacking and the features of OBBStacking are analyzed.

TI  - Effects of industrially produced 2-dimensional molybdenum disulfide materials in primary human basophils
T2  - NANOIMPACT
M3  - Article
AB  - MoS2 has been increasingly used in place of graphene as a flexible and multifunctional 2D material in many biomedical applications such as cancer detection and drug delivery, which makes it crucial to evaluate downstream compatibility in human immune cells. Molybdenum is a component of stainless-steel stent implants and has previously been implicated in stent hypersensitivity. In view of this, it is important to ascertain the effect of MoS2 on allergy-relevant cells. Basophils are a less commonly used immune cell type. Unlike mast cells, basophils can be easily derived from primary human blood and can act as a sentinel for allergy. However, merely testing any one type of MoS2 in basophils could result in different biological results. We thus decided to compare 2D MoS2 from the two companies BeDimensional (c) (BD) and Biograph Solutions (BS), manufactured with two different but commonly exploited methods (BD, deoxycholate surfactant in a high-pressure liquid exfoliation, and BS using glycine in ball-milling exfoliation) to elucidate immunological end-points common to both MoS2 and to demonstrate the need for biological verification for end-users who may require a change of supplier. We report higher histamine production in human basophils with MoS2. No effects on either surface basophil activation markers CD63 and CD203c or reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell viability were observed. However, different cytokine production patterns were evidenced. IL-6 and IL-1 beta but not TNF and GM-CSF were increased for both MoS2. BS-MoS2 increased IL-4, while BD-MoS2 decreased IL-4 and increased IL-13. Molybdate ion itself only increased IL-1 beta and IL-4. Deoxycholate surfactant decreased viability at 18 h and increased ROS upon basophil activation. Therefore, these results demonstrate the safety of MoS2 in human basophils in general and highlight the importance of considering manufacturer additives and variability when selecting and investigating 2D materials such as MoS2.

TI  - Hyperspectral Multispectral Image Fusion via Fast Matrix Truncated Singular Value Decomposition
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, methods for obtaining a high spatial resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI) by fusing a low spatial resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) and high spatial resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) have become increasingly popular. However, most fusion methods require knowing the point spread function (PSF) or the spectral response function (SRF) in advance, which are uncertain and thus limit the practicability of these fusion methods. To solve this problem, we propose a fast fusion method based on the matrix truncated singular value decomposition (FTMSVD) without using the SRF, in which our first finding about the similarity between the HR-HSI and HR-MSI is utilized after matrix truncated singular value decomposition (TMSVD). We tested the FTMSVD method on two simulated data sets, Pavia University and CAVE, and a real data set wherein the remote sensing images are generated by two different spectral cameras, Sentinel 2 and Hyperion. The advantages of FTMSVD method are demonstrated by the experimental results for all data sets. Compared with the state-of-the-art non-blind methods, our proposed method can achieve more effective fusion results while reducing the fusing time to less than 1% of such methods; moreover, our proposed method can improve the PSNR value by up to 16 dB compared with the state-of-the-art blind methods.

TI  - Mapping Forest Growing Stem Volume Using Novel Feature Evaluation Criteria Based on Spectral Saturation in Planted Chinese Fir Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest growing stem volume (GSV) is regarded as one of the most important parameters for the quality evaluation and dynamic monitoring of forest resources. The accuracy of mapping forest GSV is highly related to the employed models and involved remote sensing features, and the criteria of feature evaluation severely affect the performance of the employed models. However, due to the linear or nonlinear relationships between remote sensing features and GSV, widely used evaluation criteria inadequately express the complex sensitivity between forest GSV and spectral features, especially the saturation levels of features in a planted forest. In this study, novel feature evaluation criteria were constructed based on the Pearson correlations and optical saturation levels of the alternative remote sensing features extracted from two common optical remote sensing image sets (GF-1 and Sentinel-2). Initially, the spectral saturation level of each feature was quantified using the kriging spherical model and the quadratic model. Then, optimal feature sets were obtained with the proposed criteria and the linear stepwise regression model. Finally, four widely used machine learning models-support vector machine (SVM), multiple linear stepwise regression (MLR), random forest (RF) and K-neighborhood (KNN)-were employed to map forest GSV in a planted Chinese fir forest. The results showed that the proposed feature evaluation criteria could effectively improve the accuracy of estimating forest GSV and that the systematic distribution of errors between the predicted and ground measurements in the range of forest GSV was less than 300 m(3)/hm(2). After using the proposed feature evaluation criteria, the highest accuracy of mapping GSV was obtained with the RF model for GF-1 images (R-2 = 0.49, rRMSE = 28.67%) and the SVM model for Sentinel-2 images (R-2 = 0.52, rRMSE = 26.65%), and the decreased rRMSE values ranged from 1.1 to 6.2 for GF-1 images (28.67% to 33.08%) and from 2.3 to 6.8 for Sentinel-2 images (26.85% to 33.28%). It was concluded that the sensitivity of the optimal feature set and the accuracy of the estimated GSV could be improved using the proposed evaluation criteria (less than 300 m(3)/hm(2)). However, these criteria were barely able to improve mapping accuracy for a forest with a high GSV (larger than 300 m(3)/hm(2)).

TI  - Intelligent Retrieval of Radar Reflectivity Factor With Privacy Protection Under Meteorological Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological radar data are essential for meteorological monitoring, forecasting, and research, and it plays a crucial role in observing and warning of extreme weather risks. However, meteorological radars have some limitations, such as uneven distribution and severe topographical influence. Meteorological remote sensing satellites can partially overcome these limitations by providing larger observational scope and high spatial and temporal resolution. Using data from meteorological remote sensing satellites to train radar reflectivity factor retrieval models can effectively compensate for the missing and poor quality of radar data. However, there are still some challenges, such as extracting the features of intense convective weather with unclear coverage from complex multichannel meteorological remote sensing satellite data and removing the interference caused by nonprecipitation clouds on retrieval models. Moreover, the privacy and security of remote sensing data transmission need to be ensured. In this article, we propose a novel method that combines the advanced encryption standard method to protect the transmission of remote sensing data, a multiscale feature fusion module to extract multiscale features from multichannel meteorological remote sensing satellite data, and an attention technique to reduce the interference of nonprecipitation clouds on retrieval models. We conduct comparison experiments with multiple indicators to demonstrate that our method has certain advantages in retrieving radar reflectivity values of different sizes. Our method achieves 0.63, 0.36, 0.49, 0.55, and 0.99 on probability of detection, false alarm ratio, critical success index, Heidke skill score, and accuracy scores, respectively.

TI  - CAFE: A Cross-Attention Based Adaptive Weighting Fusion Network for MODIS and Landsat Spatiotemporal Fusion
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense medium-resolution images play an important role in time-series geoscience applications. However, due to technical limitations, remote sensing imaging systems inevitably trade off temporal frequency and spatial swaths, resulting in difficulties to acquire images simultaneously with high spatial and temporal resolution. To overcome this limitation, under the framework of residual learning, we propose a cross-attention-based adaptive weighting fusion network (CAFE) for MODIS-Landsat spatiotemporal fusion to generate dense medium-resolution images. Based on the cross-attention mechanism, we propose multichannel separated cross-attention (MSCA) and full-feature joint cross-attention (FJCA) blocks to enhance spatial resolution and retain spectral signatures from the perspectives of band-wise processing and full-feature joint processing, respectively. The adaptive temporal difference weighting mechanism (ATDWM) is proposed to improve the ability to capture dynamic land surface changes. Besides, we employ an adaptive fusion loss function to constrain the network training. Experimental results indicate that the developed method is superior to several existing algorithms in terms of visual evaluation and quantitative evaluation and it can generate high-quality fusion results in scenarios of both subtle and dramatic temporal changes. Codes are available at https://github.com/LiupengLin/CAFE.

TI  - Estimating Winter Wheat LAI Using Hyperspectral UAV Data and an Iterative Hybrid Method
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important indicator for crop growth monitoring. Due to the small number of ground-measured samples, the hybrid method, using the radiative transfer model (RTM) to generate simulated samples and combining with the regression model, is popular for LAI estimation. However, there is still difference between simulated spectrum and measured spectrum, which may affect the inversion results. In this study, an iterative hybrid method combines BP neural network and PROSAIL model, and an optimal sample selection method for crop LAI estimation was proposed. A small number of ground-measured samples and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral data were used to estimate LAI firstly. Then, the initial LAI result was used as the parameter of PROSAIL model to generate the simulated spectrum. The simulated spectrum with high similarity with the UAV spectrum and corresponding LAI value would be treated as new samples for BP neural network. After several iterations, a reasonable sample set was obtained to estimate winter wheat LAI. The method proposed in this study is evaluated using ground-measured test samples and compared with the common hybrid methods. Results indicate that with the increase of the number of training samples, the accuracy of estimation model is improved (RMSE/MAE decreased from 0.4685/0.0301 to 0.4377/0.0272, respectively, while R-2 increased from 0.5857 to 0.6384). Also, the accuracy of proposed iterative hybrid model is higher than that of commonly used hybrid model. The experiments demonstrate the relatively high accuracy of the proposed iterative hybrid method, which could be used for vegetation parameter estimation with only a small number of ground samples.

TI  - Air Quality Improvement Following COVID-19 Lockdown Measures and Projected Benefits for Environmental Health
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many regions worldwide suffer from heavy air pollution caused by particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), resulting in a huge annual disease burden and significant welfare costs. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic, enforced curfews and restrictions on human mobility (so-called periods of 'lockdown') have become important measures to control the spread of the virus. This study aims to investigate the improvement in air quality following COVID-19 lockdown measures and the projected benefits for environmental health. China was chosen as a case study. The work projects annual premature deaths and welfare costs by integrating PM2.5 and NO2 pollutant measurements derived from satellite imagery (MODIS instruments on Terra and Aqua, and TROPOMI on Sentinel-5P) with census data archived by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). A 91-day timeframe centred on the initial lockdown date of 23 January 2020 was investigated. To perform the projections, OECD data on five variables from 1990 to 2019 (mean population exposure to ambient PM2.5, premature deaths, welfare costs, gross domestic product and population) were used as training data to run the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and multiple regression models. The analysis of the satellite imagery revealed that across the regions of Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Xi'an, Shanghai and Hubei, the average concentrations of PM2.5 decreased by 6.2, 30.7, 14.1, 20.7, 29.3, 5.5 and 17.3%, while the NO2 decreased by 45.5, 54.7, 60.5, 58.7, 63.6, 50.5 and 66.5%, respectively, during the period of lockdown restrictions in 2020, as compared with the equivalent period in 2019. Such improvements in air quality were found to be beneficial, reducing in 2020 both the number of premature deaths by approximately 97,390 and welfare costs by over USD 74 billion.

TI  - Ecological Thinking in the Formation of Civilizational Orientations of the Russian Society of the Digital Age
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the problems of the modern civilizational choice of our country have been increasingly discussed. Various civilizational projects are considered from the social, economic, political, geopolitical, ideological, general cultural, confessional and other positions. At the same time, projects that pay attention to natural components that influence the formation of new civilizational orientations take the least part in these discussions. And this is understandable. We live in a growing gap between the scientific and technical, humanitarian and social components of the development of modern society, the rapid formation of a new digital era created by the increased scientific and technical power of man. This era led to the emergence of global information networks that made global communications possible, which fundamentally changes the form of organization of modern society. The concept of the formation of such a digital era was comprehensively developed in the works of D. Bell, E. Toffler, M. Castels, M. McLuhan and many other modern researchers. The paper considers the role of ecological thinking in the formation of civilizational orientations of the Russian society of the digital age. The prospects and risks of such a civilizational development are analyzed. The importance of the formation of environmentally oriented thinking for overcoming the risks and dangers of this path, for significant transformations of the formation of civilizational orientations of our country is revealed. The historical prerequisites for the emergence of ecological approaches are considered. The civilizational perspectives of the functioning of ecological thinking in modern conditions are formulated. It is proved that ecological thinking, leading to the formation of a broad ecological culture, fulfills the most important strategic task of our time - the formation of an eco-oriented civilizational attitude of its development in our country.

T2  - Journal of medical microbiology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the Global Invasive Bacterial Vaccine Preventable Disease (IB-VPD) Surveillance Network (GISN) to monitor the global burden and aetiology of bacterial meningitis, pneumonia and sepsis caused by Haemophilus influenzae (Hi), Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp).Hypothesis/Gap Statement. The GISN established an external quality assessment (EQA) programme for the characterization of Hi, Nm and Sp by culture and diagnostic PCR.Aim. To assess the performance of sentinel site laboratories (SSLs), national laboratories (NLs) and regional reference laboratories (RRLs) between 2014 and 2019 in the EQA programme.Methodology. Test samples consisted of bacterial smears for Gram-staining, viable isolates for identification and serotyping or serogrouping (ST/SG), plus simulated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples for species detection and ST/SG by PCR. SSLs and NLs were only required to analyse the slides for Gram staining and identify the species of the live isolates. RRLs, and any SLs and NLs that had the additional laboratory capacity, were also required to ST/SG the viable isolates and analyse the simulated CSF samples.Results. Across the period, 69-112 SS/NL labs and eight or nine RRLs participated in the EQA exercise. Most participants correctly identified Nm and Sp in Gram-stained smears but were less successful with Hi and other species. SSLs/NLs identified the Hi, Nm and Sp cultures well and also submitted up to 56 % of Hi, 62 % of Nm and 33 % of Sp optional ST/SG results each year. There was an increasing trend in the proportion of correct results submitted over the 6years for Nm and Sp. Some SSLs/NLs also performed the optional detection and ST/SG of the three organisms by PCR in simulated CSF from 2015 onwards; 89-100 % of the CSF samples were correctly identified and 76-93 % of Hi-, 90-100 % of Nm- and 75-100 % of Sp-positive samples were also correctly ST/SG across the distributions. The RRLs performed all parts of the EQA to a very high standard, with very few errors across all aspects of the EQA.Conclusion. The EQA has been an important tool in maintaining high standards of laboratory testing and building of laboratory capacity in the GISN.

TI  - Estimation of River Ice Thickness in the Shisifenzi Reach of the Yellow River With Remote Sensing and Air Temperature Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - River ice is an important part of the cryosphere, and effective monitoring of ice thickness information is essential for river ice research. The task of preventing and controlling winter ice damage in the Yellow River is severe, and it is significant to explore the applicability of different ice thickness estimation methods in this region. There is a lack of inversion studies on the thickness of the Yellow River ice. In this study, a typical reach of the Yellow River was selected as the research area. Based on the measured ice thickness data for many years, the applications of river ice thickness estimation models based on remote sensing and air temperature were explored respectively in this area. The results show that the VV polarized backscatter coefficient of Sentinel-1 SAR data has the highest correlation with the measured ice thickness, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.702. SAR ice thickness inversion results are helpful to identify ice jam location. The simulation accuracy of the air temperature model for ice thickness is better than that of the SAR model. Long-term air temperature-based ice thickness estimates show the maximum ice thickness in the study area is thinning at a rate of -0.7 cm a decade.

TI  - Identifying Wet and Dry Snow With Dual-Polarized C-Band SAR Data Based on Markov Random Field Model
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quad-pol synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of the most effective approaches for dry and wet snow identification data, but its applicability is limited by the high cost of quad-pol SAR data. Dual-pol SAR such as Sentinel-1 has larger spatial coverage, longer time sequences, and freely accessible data, but there is still a highly uncertainty in dual-pol SAR to distinguish dry and wet snow due to limited polarimetric information. In this study, a pixel neighborhood-based snow identification algorithm was developed and verified using dual-pol C-band SAR data in Northern Xinjiang, China. A total of six decomposed parameters were obtained to characterize the polarimetric information of dual-pol SAR data by modifying the H- a decomposition applicable to dual-pol SAR data. In the case of limited training samples, polarimetric features that were most sensitive to snow identification were selected as the optimal features for support vector machine (SVM), and the result derived from SVM was employed as the initial labels of Markov random field (MRF) model to separate dry and wet snow using iterative conditional mode (ICM). Then, the proposed algorithm, dual-pol SVM-MRF (DSVM-MRF), was validated and compared with previously published methods. The results show that the DSVM-MRF acquires the superior snow recognition with the overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient of 84.5% and 0.58%, respectively.

TI  - An Unsupervised Snow Segmentation Approach Based on Dual-Polarized Scattering Mechanism and Deep Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Distribution of snow and its melting is a critical factor affecting local weather, avalanche and flood forecasting, livelihood of people residing, and hydropower production. Most of the existing dry and wet snow identification methods were based on expensive quad-pol synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with finite generalizability, while dual-pol SAR with larger coverage, longer time series, and open availability has more advantages. In this study, an unsupervised algorithm for dry and wet snow discrimination, neighborhood-based sparse autoencoder (NSAE)weighted fuzzy C-means clustering (WFCM), is proposed based on a variety of polarimetric features derived from the H-alpha decomposition in the dual-pol mode using the C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data. NSAE-WFCM constructs a deep training network using the pixel NSAE to optimize polarimetric parameters and inputs reconstructed features with different weights into feature-WFCM to distinguish dry and wet snow for each underlying surface. Ground observation was carried out during the snow melting period of March 2021 in Altay, China, to validate the dual-pol NSAE-WFCM method with an overall accuracy and a Kappa coefficient of 88.8% and 0.68, respectively. The results show that NSAE-WFCM's accuracy is similar to that of the quadpol SAR-based dry and wet snow result (90.0%) and significantly better than that of previously published approaches extended to dual-pol SAR, such as support vector machine (SVM) (76.7%), H-a-Wishart (65.5%), total power-based method (51.7%), and wet snow-based method (43.1%). Therefore, the NSAE-WFCM algorithm improves the ability to classify wet and dry snow based on dual-pol polarimetric features, overcomes the high dependence of existing methods on quad-pol SAR data, and reduces manual interpretation by using unsupervised clustering.

TI  - Climate Change Causes Salinity To Become Determinant in Shaping the Microeukaryotic Spatial Distribution among the Lakes of the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Plateau.

AB  - Climate change greatly affects lake microorganisms in arid and semiarid zones, which alters ecosystem functions and the ecological security of lakes. However, the responses of lake microorganisms, especially microeukaryotes, to climate change are poorly understood. Here, using 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) high-throughput sequencing, we investigated the distribution patterns of microeukaryotic communities and whether and how climate change directly or indirectly affected the microeukaryotic communities on the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Plateau. Our results showed that climate change, as the main driving force of lake change, drives salinity to become a determinant of the microeukaryotic community among the lakes of the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Plateau. Salinity shapes the diversity and trophic level of the microeukaryotic community and further affects lake carbon cycling. Co-occurrence network analysis further revealed that increasing salinity reduced the complexity but improved the stability of microeukaryotic communities and changed ecological relationships. Meanwhile, increasing salinity enhanced the importance of deterministic processes in microeukaryotic community assembly, and the dominance of stochastic processes in freshwater lakes transformed into deterministic processes in salt lakes. Furthermore, we established lake biomonitoring and climate sentinel models by integrating microeukaryotic information, which would provide substantial improvements to our predictive ability of lake responses to climate change. IMPORTANCE Our findings have important implications for understanding the distribution patterns and the driving mechanisms of microeukaryotic communities among the lakes of the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Plateau and whether and how climate change directly or indirectly affects microeukaryotic communities. Our study also establishes the groundwork to use the lake microbiome for the assessment of aquatic ecological health and climate change, which is critical for ecosystem management and for projecting the ecological consequences of future climate warming.

TI  - Applying Convolutional Neural Network to Predict Soil Erosion: A Case Study of Coastal Areas.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The development of ecological restoration projects is unsatisfactory, and soil erosion is still a problem in ecologically restored areas. Traditional soil erosion studies are mostly based on satellite remote sensing data and traditional soil erosion models, which cannot accurately characterize the soil erosion conditions in ecological restoration areas (mainly plantation forests). This paper uses high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images as the base data, which could improve the accuracy of the study. Considering that traditional soil erosion models cannot accurately express the complex relationships between erosion factors, this paper applies convolutional neural network (CNN) models to identify the soil erosion intensity in ecological restoration areas, which can solve the problem of nonlinear mapping of soil erosion. In this study area, compared with the traditional method, the accuracy of soil erosion identification by applying the CNN model improved by 25.57%, which is better than baseline methods. In addition, based on research results, this paper analyses the relationship between land use type, vegetation cover, and slope and soil erosion. This study makes five recommendations for the prevention and control of soil erosion in the ecological restoration area, which provides a scientific basis and decision reference for subsequent ecological restoration decisions.

TI  - A New Hierarchical Multiplication and Spectral Mixing Method for Quantification of Forest Coverage Changes Using Gaofen (GF)-1 Imagery in Zhejiang Province, China
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest survey is a prerequisite or critical for ecological conservation. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) is an effective method to extract the forest coverage and its changes; however, it is mostly applied to hyperspectral image data processing due primarily to the limit of the number of spectral bands. Therefore, a hierarchical multiplication (HM) model based on the hierarchical method and stepwise multiplication algorithm is proposed for forest coverage extraction using multispectral images. Within the process, the hierarchical method reduces the complexity of the problem to satisfy the SMA at each level, and the multiplication method transfers forest abundances among levels for the soft classification. Compared with Zhejiang Forest Bureau Reports, the HM method in this study extracted 98.43% of forests using the 16-m resolution Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide field of view (WFV) data, which has a 95% correlation coefficient with results obtained by the 2-m resolution panchromatic/ multispectral (PMS) data using the support vector machine (SVM) method. Zhejiang's overall forest coverage was found to exceed 60% in 2019, with a standard deviation of 0.419 pixels. Densely covered forests are primarily distributed in mountains and hills and have slightly increased from 2014 to 2019, while sparsely covered forests are mostly located in plains, basins, and valleys and slightly have declined during the past five years. The forest coverage is mainly affected by topography, population, economy, and policies. The experiment indicates the combined use of HM and multispectral data can accurately extract forest cover changes and achieve similar results compared to more sophisticated classifications using higher precision/spectral band (hyperspectral) data.

TI  - Thick Cloud Removal Under Land Cover Changes Using Multisource Satellite Imagery and a Spatiotemporal Attention Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing satellites provide observations of the Earth's surface, which are crucial data for applications and analyses in several fields, including agriculture, environmental protection, and sustainable development. However, the wide and frequent occurrence of clouds highly undermines the quality and availability of usable optical data, particularly low-temporal-resolution data. Although deep learning techniques have facilitated recent progress in cloud removal algorithms, thick cloud removal under changing land cover remains challenging. In this study, we propose a framework to remove thick clouds, thin clouds, and cloud shadow from Sentinel-2 images. The framework integrates the spatial detail in a Sentinel-2 reference image and the coarse spectral pattern in a near-target-date Sentinel-3 image as spatiotemporal guidance to generate missing data with land cover change information in a cloudy Sentinel-2 image. The reconstruction is performed using a spatiotemporal attention network (STAN) that adopts the self-attention mechanism, residual learning, and high-pass features to enhance feature extraction from the multisource data. The experimental results show that STAN outperforms residual u-net (ResUnet), cloud-removal network (CRN), convolutional neural network-based spatial-temporal-spectral (STS-CNN), and DSen2-CR in terms of multiple quantitative metrics and visual characteristics. The comparative experiment proves that the integration of Sentinel-3 data improves the cloud removal performance, especially in areas with distinctive and heterogeneous land cover changes under large-scale cloud cover. The experimental results also indicate high generalizability of STAN when the Sentinel-3 image is far from the target date, when transferring features to cloud removal for new images, and even with limited training data that simulates severe cloud cover.

TI  - Comprehensive Evaluation and Analysis of Human Settlements' Suitability in the Yangtze River Delta Based on Multi-Source Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The suitability of human settlements is critical for quality of life and regional development. As comprehensive evaluations and research on the suitability of human settlements are lacking, a comprehensive evaluation of human settlements in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) was carried out in 2020 by combining natural and human environmental elements based on multi-source data such as digital elevation models, Landsat remote sensing images, meteorological station data, and points of interest, other multi-source data, and constructions of the human settlements' suitability indexes. The results showed the following: (1) The spatial suitability of the natural environment in the YRD is significantly affected by the topographic conditions and distance from the sea, showing an increasing spatial differentiation from southwest to northeast, with Shanghai and Yancheng having the best natural environment suitability. (2) The suitability of the human environment in urban areas is better than that in non-urban areas and shows a decreasing trend from the south to the north circle. Shanghai, Zhoushan, and Huaibei have the best human environment suitability. (3) The comprehensive suitability of human settlements includes both the spatial differentiation characteristics of the suitability of natural and human environments. Shanghai and Zhoushan have the mosy comprehensive suitability for human settlements, while Huaibei and Xuzhou have the worst. (4) Land with a comprehensive suitability for human settlements of greater than 0.580 accounts for 23.60% of the total and contains 30.08% of the population and 32.31% of the economy, indicating that areas with a high suitability index have been fully utilized, and the populations and economies with human settlements suitability have a high degree of matching.

TI  - Large-Scale Impervious Surface Area Mapping and Pattern Evolution of the Yellow River Delta Using Sentinel-1/2 on the GEE
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological environment of Yellow River Delta High-efficiency Ecological Economic Zone (YRDHEEZ) is adjacent to the Bohai Sea. The unique geographical location makes it highly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances. As an important land surface biophysical parameter, the impervious surface area (ISA) can characterize the level of urbanization and measure the intensity of human activities, and hence, the timely understanding of ISA dynamic changes is of great significance to protect the ecological safety of the YRDHEEZ. Based on the multi-source and multi-modal Sentinel-1/2 remotely sensed data provided by Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, this study developed a novel approach for the extraction of time-series ISA in the YRDHEEZ through a combination of random forest algorithm and numerous representative features extracted from Sentinel-1/2. Subsequently, we revealed the pattern of the ISA spatial-temporal evolution in this region over the past five years. The results demonstrated that the proposed method has good performance with an average overall accuracy of 94.84% and an average kappa coefficient of 0.9393, which verified the feasibility of the proposed method for large-scale ISA mapping with 10 m. Spatial-temporal evolution analysis revealed that the ISA of the YRDHEEZ decreased from 5211.39 km(2) in 2018 to 5147.02 km(2) in 2022 with an average rate of -16.09 km(2)/year in the last 5 years, suggesting that the ISA of YRDHEEZ has decreased while its overall pattern was not significantly changed over time. The presented workflow can provide a reference for large-scale ISA mapping and its evolution analysis, especially in regions on estuarine deltas.

TI  - A Deep Learning Method for Offshore Raft Aquaculture Extraction Based on Medium-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture has experienced significant growth, contributing to resolving the global food crisis and delivering substantial economic benefits. Nevertheless, the uncontrolled expansion of aquaculture activities has led to an ecological crisis in offshore waters. This highlights the critical need for precise delineation and monitoring of aquaculture areas in these regions to ensure scientific management and sustainable development of coastal areas. In this article, we introduced an SRUNet model based on the Swin Transformer for accurately extracting offshore raft aquaculture areas using medium-resolution remote sensing images. Our SRUNet model combined the UNet model with the Swin Transformer block and the residual block to account for multiscale features, resulting in excellent extraction performance in diverse and complex sea areas. To evaluate the model, we selected four typical raft aquaculture areas and compared the SRUNet model with other comparative network models. Results revealed that the SRUNet model outperformed all other models, and the F1 Score and MIoU of the classification results were 86.52% and 87.22%, respectively. The model reduced the loss of feature information and misclassification of aquaculture areas, generating extraction effects that aligned closely with real aquaculture area shapes. Additionally, we tested the performance of each component of the SRUNet model. The results indicate that the SRUNet model exhibits strong robustness and effectively filters out irrelevant information. These results demonstrate the model's potential for large-scale extraction of offshore aquaculture areas.

TI  - Mapping Tunneling-Induced Uneven Ground Subsidence Using Sentinel-1 SAR Interferometry: A Twin-Tunnel Case Study of Downtown Los Angeles, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry is a formidable technique to monitor surface deformation with a millimeter detection resolution. This study applies the Persistent Scatter-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR (TM)) technique to measure ground subsidence related to a twin-tunnel excavation in downtown Los Angeles, USA. The PSInSAR (TM) technique is suitable for urban settings because urban areas have strong reflectors. The twin tunnels in downtown Los Angeles were excavated beneath a densely urbanized area with variable overburden depths. In practice, tunneling-induced ground settlement is dominantly vertical. The vertical deformation rate in this study is derived by combining Line of Sight (LOS) deformation velocities obtained from SAR images from both ascending and descending satellite orbits. Local and uneven settlements up to approximately 12 mm/year along the tunnel alignment are observed within the allowable threshold. No severe damages to aboveground structures were reported. Furthermore, ground movements mapped one year before tunnel construction indicate that no concentrated ground settlements pre-existed. A Machine Learning (ML)-based permutation feature importance method is used for a parametric study to identify dominant factors associated with the twin-tunneling induced uneven ground subsidence. Six parameters are selected to conduct the parametric study, including overburden thickness, i.e., the thickness of artificial fill and alluvium soils above the tunnel springline, the distance between the two tunnel centerlines, the depth to the tunnel springline, building height, the distance to the tunnel, and groundwater level. Results of the parametric analysis indicate that overburden thickness, i.e., the thickness of artificial fill and alluvium soils above the tunnel springline, is the dominant contributing factor, followed by the distance between tunnel centerlines, depth to the tunnel springline, and building height. Two parameters, the distance to the tunnel, and the groundwater level, play lesser essential roles than others. In addition, the geological profile provides comprehension of unevenly distributed ground settlements, which are geologically sensitive and more concentrated in areas with thick artificial fill and alluvium soils, low tunnel depth, and high groundwater levels.

TI  - FY-3E Wind Scatterometer Prelaunch and Commissioning Performance Verification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spaceborne microwave scatterometer (SCAT) is a radar for quantitatively measuring the backscatter coefficient of the Earth's surface. Its main application is the measurement of wind speed and direction near the sea surface with a wide swath and high precision. So far, many SCATs have been launched in orbit, including SeaWinds by the United States, the advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) series by Europe, and the HY-2 series scatterometers by China, which contribute to improved weather forecasts and typhoon positioning services. The Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) satellite wind scatterometer or WindRad, launched by China in July 2021, is the first Ku and C dual-band SCAT with the highest spatial resolution. In this study, the rotation characteristics and calibration parameters of WindRad in the prelaunch stage and after its early test and verification in orbit were investigated. The prelaunch test results demonstrated the excellent performance of WindRad, which can fully meet its quantitative application requirements. In-orbit early tests demonstrated the stable operation of WindRad, with signal characteristics consistent with the design specifications. The Ku and C dual-band earth surface backscatter coefficient projection and the sea surface wind field inversion were also investigated. The preliminary results confirmed the ability of WindRad to provide a high-quality ocean wind measurement and the improved capability for different applications, including sea ice detection and soil moisture measurement.

TI  - Dense Temperature Mapping and Heat Wave Risk Analysis Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As high temperature and heat wave have become great threats to human survival, social stability, and ecological safety, it is of great significance to master the spatial and temporal dynamic changes of temperature to prevent high temperature and heat wave risks. The meteorological station can provide accurate near-ground temperature, but only within a specific space and time. In order to meet the needs of large-scale research, spatial interpolation methods were widely used to obtain spatially continuous temperature maps. However, these methods often ignore the influence of external factors on temperature, such as land cover, height, etc., and neglect to supplement temporal-wise information. To deal with these issues, a joint spatio-temporal method is proposed to obtain dense temperature mapping from multisource remote sensing data, which combining a geographically weighted regression model and a polynomial fitting model. Besides, a heat wave risk model is also built based on the dense temperature maps and population data, in order to evaluate the heat wave risk of different areas. Accuracy evaluations and experiments have verified the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Case study on the four cities of Zhejiang Province, China have demonstrated that areas with higher degree of urbanization are often accompanied by higher heat wave risks, such as the northern part of the study area. The study also found that the heat wave risks have presented a centralized distribution and spatial autocorrelation characteristics in the study area.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To get the high resolution multi-spectral (HRMS) images by the fusion of low resolution multi-spectral (LRMS) and panchromatic (PAN) images, an effectively pansharpening model with spatial Hessian non-convex sparse and spectral gradient low rank priors (PSHNSSGLR) is proposed in this paper. In particularly, from the statistical aspect of view, the spatial Hessian hyper-Laplacian non-convex sparse prior is developed to model the spatial Hessian consistency between HRMS and PAN. More importantly, it is recently the first work for pansharpening modeling with the spatial Hessian hyper-Laplacian non-convex sparse prior. Meanwhile, the spectral gradient low rank prior on HRMS is further developed for spectral feature preservation. Then, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach is applied for optimizing the proposed PSHNSSGLR model. Afterwards, many fusion experiments demonstrate the capability and superiority of PSHNSSGLR.

TI  - CFNet: An Eigenvalue Preserved Approach to Multiscale Building Segmentation in High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, AI and deep learning (DL) methods have been widely used for object classification, recognition, and segmentation of high-resolution multispectral remote sensing images. These DL-based solutions perform better compared with the traditional spectral algorithms but still suffer from insufficient optimization of global and local features of object context. In addition, failure of code-data isolation and/or disclosure of detailed eigenvalues cause serious privacy and even secret leakage due to the sensitivity of high-resolution remote sensing data and their processing mechanisms. In this article, class feature modules have been presented in the decoder part of an attention-based CNN network to distinguish between building and nonbuilding (background) area. In this way, context features of a focused object can be extracted with more details being processed while the resolution of images is maintained. The reconstructed local and global feature values and dependencies in the proposed model are maintained by reconfiguring multiple effective attention modules with contextual dependencies to achieve better results for the eigenvalue. According to quantitative results and their visualization, the proposed model has depicted better performance over others' work using two large-scale building remote sensing datasets. The F1-score of this model reached 87.91 and 89.58 on WHU Buildings Dataset and Massachusetts Buildings Dataset, respectively, which exceeded the other semantic segmentation models.

TI  - A Multi-Level Label-Aware Semi-Supervised Framework for Remote Sensing Scene Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising approach to reduce the labeling burden in remote sensing scene classification tasks. However, most semi-supervised methods typically exploit the single-level semantic information of unlabeled data, ignoring the multi-level semantic structure prevalent in remote sensing data. The multi-level semantic structure, which contains the correlation of different categories and the multi-granularity semantic information, can help the scene classification model to more accurately measure the feature distance between different categories and more effectively utilize unlabeled data. Therefore, this article proposes a multi-level label-aware (MLLA) semi-supervised scene classification framework, MLLA, which extends the semantic information captured in unlabeled data from single-level to multi-level to improve the scene classification performance. Specifically, we first propose a multi-level prototype awareness module to capture the multi-level semantic structure underlying remote sensing data. Then, based on this structure, a multi-level pseudo-label generation module is designed to assign multi-level pseudo-labels to the unlabeled data. Finally, by combining the labeled samples and the multi-level pseudo-labeled samples, the scene classification model is progressively trained. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed MLLA achieves excellent performance compared to other semi-supervised classification methods.

TI  - Dual-Task Interactive Learning for Unsupervised Spatio-Temporal-Spectral Fusion of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal-spectral fusion aims to produce high spatio-temporal-spectral resolution images by integrating the complementary spatial, temporal, and spectral advantages of multisource remote sensing images. However, on one hand, the existing spatio-temporal-spectral fusion methods are insufficient to exploit the inherent complex nonlinear spatial, temporal, and spectral relationship among multisource and multitemporal observations. On the other hand, since the unavailability of real high spatio-temporal-spectral resolution images, it is difficult to adopt deep learning (DL) methods with supervised training. In this article, we propose an effective unsupervised spatio-temporal-spectral fusion model (USTSFM) with dual-task interactive learning to alleviate these problems. The proposed USTSFM has two branches: the spatio-temporal-spectral mapping (STSM) branch is to describe the temporal relationship, and the spectral super-resolution (SSR) branch is to model the spectral relationship. Moreover, the spatial-spectral interaction compensation block is designed to make the two branches compensate and benefit from each other. This intrinsically related and mutually facilitated strategy allows the USTSFM to sufficiently exploit the inherent spatial, temporal, and spectral relationship. In addition, a shared reconstruction module is meticulously designed for the two tasks, which not only reduces the parameters but also allows the supervised task to guide the convergence of the unsupervised task, boosting the stability of unsupervised training. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrated that the proposed USTSFM has richer spatial details and more accurate predictions than the other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Detail Injection-Based Spatio-Temporal Fusion for Remote Sensing Images With Land Cover Changes
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal fusion can generate time-series images with high spatial resolution, and it is highly desirable in various applications, especially in monitoring fine dynamic changes of surface features on remote sensing images. Currently, most spatio-temporal fusion methods predict the target fine image by employing the auxiliary fine images on neighboring phases; however, they are generally limited in abrupt land cover changes between the target and the neighboring auxiliary images. In this article, we propose a novel detail injection-based spatio-temporal fusion (DISTF) model to alleviate this problem, by exploring the inherent relationship between the spatio-temporal fusion and spatio-spectral fusion. The proposed DISTF consists of three modules: a three-branch detail injection (TDI) module, a fine detail prediction (FDP) module, and a reconstruction module. The interpretable TDI module is inspired by spatio-spectral fusion, aiming to inject the non-changed detail information extracted from the neighboring fine images into the target coarse image, which can preserve the abrupt change information captured in the target coarse image. The FDP module is designed to further integrate the correlated information from the outputs of TDI and refine the spatial-spectral information to boost the fusion accuracy. Finally, the reconstruction module and the hybrid loss function are designed to more effective reconstruct the high-quality target fine image. The qualitative and quantitative experimental results on two datasets with different types of changes demonstrated that the proposed DISTF method achieves richer spatial detail and more accurate prediction than the eight existing methods.

TI  - Spatial Patterns and Intensity of Ecosystem Service Values in Beijing
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem services (ES) are the benefits that humans receive from nature. The payments for ES provide financial incentives to urban managers to conserve natural ecosystems. The spatial pattern and intensity of ES values have become leading principles of urban planning. Although most ES evaluations of urban regions are at the city scale, urban land planning is typically made at the landscape level. The applications of remote sensing data provide a great opportunity for quantifying the ES in a finer analytical unit. In this study, we investigated the spatial patterns of ES in Beijing by calculating the economic value of each ES based on the landscape type. We compared the ES intensities observed in different administrative districts and land use types, and we obtained the following results: (1) The ES values in Beijing are distributed in a spatial pattern with low value at the center and high values in the surrounding area, with the highest value in Miyun District and the lowest value in Dongcheng District. The difference in ES intensity between above two districts is 4.087 x 10(4) yuan per hectare. (2) The ES type with higher value in Beijing are hydrology regulation and climate regulation services. (3) The land use type of forest is the main source of ES values, accounting for 67.2% of the total value. This study provides a spatial clarification of ES value in Beijing, which could supply a scientific reference to support urban optimization and resource allocation.

TI  - Extraction and spatiotemporal changes of open-pit mines during 1985-2020 using Google Earth Engine: A case study of Qingzhou City, Shandong Province, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The global use of mineral resources has increased exponentially for decades and will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, resulting in increasingly negative impacts on the surrounding environment. However, to date, there are a lack of historical and current spatial extent datasets with high accuracy for mining areas in many parts of the world, which has hindered a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental impacts of mining. Using the Google Earth Engine cloud platform and the Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets, the spatial extent data of open-pit mining areas for eight years (1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020) was extracted by the Otsu algorithm. The limestone mining areas in Qingzhou, Shandong Province, China, was selected as a case study. The annual maximum NDVI was first derived from the Landsat NDVI datasets, and then the Otsu algorithm was used to segment the annual maximum NDVI images to obtain the extent of the mining areas. Finally, the spatiotemporal characteristics of the mining areas in the study region were analyzed in reference to previous survey data. The results showed that the mining areas were primarily located in Shaozhuang Town, Wangfu Street and the northern part of Miaozi Town, and the proportion of mining areas within these three administrative areas has increased annually from 88% in 1985 to more than 98% in 2010. Moreover, the open-pit mining areas in Qingzhou gradually expanded from a scattered, point-like distribution to a large, contiguous distribution. From 1985 to 2020, the open-pit mining area expanded to more than 10 times its original size at a rate of 0.5 km(2)/year. In 2015, this area reached its maximum size of 19.7 km(2) and slightly decreased in 2020. Furthermore, the expansion of the mining areas in Qingzhou went through three stages: a slow growth period before 1995, a rapid expansion period from 1995 to 2005, and a shutdown and remediation period after 2005. A quantitative accuracy assessment was performed by calculating the Intersection over Union (IoU) of the extraction results and the visual interpretation results from Gaofen-2 images with 1-m spatial resolution. The IoU reached 72%. The results showed that it was feasible to threshold the Landsat annual maximum NDVI data by the Otsu algorithm to extract the annual spatial extent of the open-pit mining areas. Our method will be easily transferable to other regions worldwide, enabling the monitoring of mine environments.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Mapping in China Using Multimodal Fine-Grained Dual Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the advancement of geo-systems and the increased availability of satellite data, a plethora of land-use and land-cover (LULC) products have been developed. The existing LULC products primarily relied on time-series imagery to classify land by pixel-based classifiers, allowing for local analysis and accurate boundary detection. However, the advent of deep learning has shifted toward the use of patch-based CNN models for generating land cover maps. In this article: 1) we create a training dataset for China using a voting strategy based on three off-the-shelf available LULC products, avoiding the labor-intensive manual annotation. 2) We design a novel CNN-based model for the LULC task, called multimodal fine-grained dual network (dubbed as Dual-Net), which takes dual-date images to generate final maps and reduces the need for gap-free temporal sequences or separate cloud detection. To leverage the correlation between location, date, and category, we embed modal information (dates and geo-locations) into the model. Furthermore, by incorporating low-level constraints and using pseudolabel refinement, we continually improve the performance and achieve more refined segmentation. 3) Due to the lack of a suitable validation dataset for China, we create a new validation dataset called the China Sentinel2 Validation Dataset (CSVD) by manually annotating 733 finely labeled images of 1024 x 1024 pixels of China-specific Sentinel2 data. 4) Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing LULC products and produces more fine-grained segmentation results comparable to other patch-based products. Finally, we release annual LULC maps for China in 2020-2022 and also make our model accessible online for real-time results export.

TI  - Remote estimation of leaf nitrogen concentration in winter oilseed rape across growth stages and seasons by correcting for the canopy structural effect
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating crop leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC, %) with the canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) is an effective method for detecting the nitrogen (N) deficiency in crops. It is challenging to remotely estimate LNC across growth stages and seasons with a general empirical model, since the complex change in canopy structure under N deficiencies and across growth stages affects the accuracy of the estimations. The canopy scattering coefficient (CSC), the ratio of the BRF to the directional area scattering factor (DASF), has been suggested to reduce the canopy structural effect on BRF. However, the DASF can only be calculated for closed canopies and is not applicable to the early growth stages of crops when the fields are sparsely vegetated. This study proposed a new method for decoupling the canopy structural effect and canopy BRF using the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV). NIRV is driven by the change in canopy structure while mitigates the soil contribution. The method was tested through six field experiments on ten farmers' fields of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) using both in-situ hyperspectral data and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral images. The results demonstrated that NIRV was closely related to the leaf area index (LAI) (R-2 = 0.79) across growth stages and seasons. The CSC was derived with NIRV based on the linear relationship between NIRV and DASF for the closed canopies. The LNC predicted by the NIRV-derived CSC (R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.51 for in-situ hyperspectral data and R-2 = 0.65, RMSE = 0.49 for UAV multispectral images) was more accurate than the results derived from the BRF (R-2 = 0.55, RMSE = 0.62 for in-situ hyperspectral data and R-2 = 0.59, RMSE = 0.60 for UAV multispectral images) with the independent dataset, suggesting that correcting for the canopy structural effect with NIRV provided a new alternative for suppressing the impact of canopy structure on the canopy BRF. As NIRV is easily calculated with diverse remote sensing data sources, this study proved the potential of applying NIRV to improving the accuracy and transferability of the LNC prediction model at different scales.

TI  - Estimating Hourly All-Weather Land Surface Temperature From FY-4A/AGRI Imagery Using the Surface Energy Balance Theory
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) observations from geostationary satellites enable the retrieval of the diurnal variations in land surface temperatures (LSTs) linked to the land-atmosphere energy exchange and the water cycle. However, cloud cover obstructs TIR signals and leads to missing gaps that generally account for more than 50% of TIR LST maps. This study proposed an effective method to estimate hourly all-weather LST from the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) data under the framework of surface energy balance (SEB) theory. An improved temperature and emissivity separation algorithm was first used to obtain the high-quality clear-sky LST, which plays a decisive role in ensuring the accuracy of recovered cloudy-sky LST. Then, we proposed a unique way to solve the temperature difference (Delta LST) between the cloudy-sky LST and hypothetical clear-sky LST caused by cloud radiative effects (CREs). The bias and root mean squared error (RMSE) of the estimated AGRI hourly cloudy-sky LST are 0.10 K and 3.71 K during the daytime, and -0.20 K and 2.73 K during the nighttime, respectively. The overall bias (RMSE) of the estimated AGRI all-weather LST is 0.02 K (2.84 K). The estimated hourly all-weather LST not only captures the rapid variation in diurnal LST but is also promising for temporal upscaling. The temporally upscaled daily mean LST shows a bias (RMSE) of 0.03 K (1.35 K). This study provides a promising solution to generate diurnal hourly all-weather LST for AGRI and other geostationary satellites.

TI  - Temporal Upscaling of MODIS 1-km Instantaneous Land Surface Temperature to Monthly Mean Value: Method Evaluation and Product Generation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monthly mean land surface temperature (MMLST) reflects more stable intra- and interannual temperature variations, and therefore, it has a wider range of applications than instantaneous land surface temperature (LST). This study aimed to generate a high-resolution global MMLST product by temporally upscaling the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 1-km instantaneous LST. First, six current methods were comprehensively evaluated using cross-validation technology. These six methods are the cross combinations of two temporal aggregation schemes: the average by observations (ABO) and average by days (ABD), and three conversion models: the diurnal temperature cycle model (DTC), the simple average of two instantaneous LSTs (TSA), and a weighted average model for multiple instantaneous LSTs (MWA). The analysis with measurements from 235 flux stations worldwide revealed that the choice of conversion model considerably affected the overall retrieval accuracy, whereas the influence of the aggregation scheme was minor. From the conversion model standpoint, MWA performed best, followed by DTC, and finally TSA; this order remained the same even if DTC and TSA were improved with mean bias correction. Notably, the errors of ABD(MWA) decreased as the number of daily mean LST (NOD) increased, whereas the errors of ABO(MWA) were not related to NOD. Accordingly, we deduced that the optimal strategy for estimating MMLST is using ABO(MWA) when NOD is < 20 and ABD(MWA) when NOD is >= 20. Subsequently, we adopted this combination method to process MODIS instantaneous LSTs and produced a global 1-km MMLST dataset for the years 2003-2020. The validation showed a satisfactory accuracy with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.6 K. The intercomparison with MMLSTs from geostationary (GEO) satellites (containing complete LST daily cycle) presented a good agreement (biases < 0.3 K and STDs < 2 K). Compared with atmospheric infrared sounder (AIRS) L3 monthly standard physical retrieval (AIRS3STM) product which had the same temporal span, the newly generated product exhibited a high consistency in reflecting temporal variations of global temperature. Most importantly, it had a prominently better ability to retrieve spatial details of temperature variations due to its higher resolution. Our new method and product show promising prospects for applications in global change studies, where accurate spatially resolved MMLST data are one of the fundamental geophysical variables required.

TI  - Mun-GAN: A Multiscale Unsupervised Network for Remote Sensing Image Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing image fusion, pansharpening is a type of remote sensing image fusion method that aims to fuse panchromatic (PAN) images and multispectral (MS) images to produce high-resolution MS (HRMS) images. Deep learning-based pansharpening technology offers a series of advanced unsupervised algorithms. However, there are several challenges: 1) the existing unsupervised pansharpening methods only consider the fusion of single-scale features; 2) for the fusion of MS and PAN image feature branches, the existing pansharpening methods are implemented directly by concatenation and summation, without paying attention to critical features or suppressing redundant features; and 3) the semantic gap in the long skip connections of the network architecture will create unexpected results. In this article, we design a multiscale unsupervised architecture based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) for remote sensing image pansharpening (Mun-GAN), which consists of a generator and two discriminators. The generator includes a multiscale feature extractor (MFE), a self-adaptation weighted fusion (SWF) module, and a nest feature aggregation (NFA) module. First, the MFE is utilized to extract multiscale feature information from the input images and to then pass this information to the SWF module for adaptive weight fusion. Then, multiscale features are reconstructed by the NFA module to obtain HRMS images. The two discriminators are spectral and spatial discriminators used against the generator. Moreover, we design a hybrid loss function to aggregate the multiscale spectral and spatial feature information. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods using QuickBird, GaoFen-2, and WorldView-3 images, this demonstrates that the Mun-GAN yields better fusion results.

TI  - High Spatial Resolution Gap-Free Global and Regional Ocean Color Products
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite ocean color products derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-20, and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on the Sentinel-3A (S3A) and Sentinel-3B (S3B) have been widely used for surveillance of the ocean environment and research on ocean physical, biological, biogeochemical, and ecological processes. However, either VIIRS or OLCI daily ocean color images are often incomplete in spatial coverage due to cloud cover, contamination of high sun glint, narrow swath width, high sensor-zenith angle, high solar-zenith angle, and/or other unfavorable retrieval conditions. Although merging daily ocean color images from multiple satellite sensors can help reduce the number of invalid pixels, gap-filling methods, such as the data interpolating empirical orthogonal function (DINEOF), are often used to reconstruct invalid pixels and generate gap-free images. The 9-km spatial resolution global gap-free ocean color data have been routinely produced by the NOAA Ocean Color Science Team and distributed through NOAA Coast-Watch (https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cw/index.html). In this study, we aim to develop and produce improved spatial resolution gap-free products, including chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm [K-d(490)], and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration for spatial resolutions of 0.5-, 1-, and 2-km. Two-sensor (VIIRS-SNPP and VIIRS-NOAA-20), three-sensor (two-sensor + OLCI-S3A), and four-sensor (three-sensor + OLCI-S3B) daily merged global Level-3 ocean color data are created and compared. It is found that, by merging data from the two VIIRS sensors, similar to 38% more valid ocean product data are retrieved compared with a single sensor from either SNPP or NOAA-20. Adding OLCI-S3A to the two-sensor merged data can increase the number of valid pixels by similar to 12%, and adding OLCI-S3B to the three-sensor merged data can further increase the number of valid pixels by similar to 8%. The DINEOF method is applied to daily two-, three-, and four-sensor merged data to generate global 2-km resolution gap-free images. Results show that 2-km resolution gap-free images are able to resolve fine ocean features, such as coastal eddies and filaments, which are not available in the 9-km resolution images. While adding OLCI-S3A data significantly improves the three-sensor-derived gap-free images over the two-sensor images, no significant enhancement is found in the four-sensor-derived gap-free images by adding OLCI-S3B data. The DINEOF method is also applied to 1- and 0.5-km resolution four-sensor merged Chl-a, K-d(490), and SPM images in the Gulf of Mexico and U.S. West Coast region. It is found that both 0.5- and 1-km resolution images show more detailed ocean structures and features in coastal regions.

TI  - A simple approach to enhance the TROPOMI solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence product by combining with canopy reflected radiation at near-infrared band
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based data of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and the near-infrared radiation reflected by vegetation (NIRvP) are being increasingly used for the estimation of vegetation gross primary product (GPP) at the global scale. Although SIF contains more physiological information than NIRvP, NIRvP can have higher data quality and spatio-temporal resolution. Therefore, the two variables can be considered complementary for GPP monitoring. Here, we propose a simple framework to combine SIF and NIRvP data from different data sources to generate an enhanced SIF product (eSIF). The original SIF data comes from the TROPOMI instrument onboard the Sentinel-5P mission, whereas NIRvP data are derived from MODIS spectral reflectance and ERA5 reanalysis data. The resulting eSIF product has a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees and a temporal resolution of 8 days, as well as a higher signal-to-noise ratio and a lower angular dependency than the original TROPOMI SIF data. Our results demonstrate that eSIF has similar spatial patterns to the original SIF but is more spatially continuous and less noisy. Comparisons with the FLUXCOM global GPP product show that eSIF has a more universal relationship with GPP than NIRvP for different grass/crop plant functional types (the coefficients of variation are 18.9% for slopes of GPP to eSIF and 27.3% for slopes of GPP to NIRvP), but NIRvP outperforms eSIF for tracking GPP for forest PFTs exclude BoENF. Moreover, eSIF is able to better track the seasonal variations in GPP related to environmental stresses. This study highlights that our methodology based on the combination of SIF and NIRvP is a promising approach for better monitoring of GPP.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Net Primary Production in Northeast China Using the Physiological Principles Predicting Growth Model Driven by Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating net primary production (NPP) for various forest types on a large scale is of great significance to the global carbon cycle and climate change, particularly in terms of monthly variations. Most studies focus on the NPP estimation of individual tree species or a single forest type, and few studies explore the NPP estimation of multiple forest types simultaneously. Here, we aimed to explore the potential of the physiological principles predicting growth (3-PG) model to estimate the NPP of six typical tree species in Northeast China. Forest NPP was estimated on the basis of the 3-PG model using the fractional vegetation cover and leaf area index derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensors. In addition, the monthly variation in forest NPP and factors influencing the NPP were analyzed. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can yield reliable NPP estimates, and the determination coefficient (R-2) between the estimated results and those obtained using the existing MODIS products was between 0.4010 and 0.5462. The forest NPP peaked approximately in July and was zero from October to April. Furthermore, the analysis of environmental effects on NPP indicated that temperature and site nutrition are the dominant forest growth factors, whereas available soil water is a limiting factor. Overall, we demonstrate that the proposed methodological framework satisfactorily estimated the NPP of the six typical tree species and has significant potential for forest growth prediction in China.

TI  - Monitoring the Evolution of Spatiotemporal Landscape Pattern in Megacity Beijing Using Long Time Series of Landsat Data
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the dynamics of an urban landscape pattern is significant for urban ecological environment evaluation. Previous studies on urban landscape monitoring are relatively few, making it difficult to comprehensively reflect the characteristics of urban landscape patterns. Here, we proposed a methodological framework to monitor the dynamics of the landscape pattern, vegetation coverage, and the habitat quality using the Landsat imagery obtained from 1999 to 2021 in Beijing, China. First, changes in the landscape characteristics associated with land use were explored by the transfer matrix and landscape metric analysis methods. Subsequently, the dimidiate pixel model was employed to analyze changes in regional vegetation coverage on a landscape perspective. Finally, the habitat quality was evaluated on the basis of remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) model, and the correlation between the habitat quality and the landscape index was retrieved using the gray correlation degree model. The results showed that the landscape pattern underwent fragmentation, and the edge effect was strong. A high vegetation coverage was dominant throughout the landscape, and a medium vegetation coverage was relatively scattered, especially in built-up areas. The landscape was highly fragmented in areas with a low vegetation coverage. There were significant regional differences in habitat quality, and the quality was higher in the northwest and western mountainous areas. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation between the habitat quality and the index-based landscape pattern, which demonstrated the distribution pattern of landscape types significantly impacts habits quality. Overall, these findings are significant for future urban planning and construction.

TI  - Remote sensing of subtropical tree diversity: The underappreciated roles of the practical definition of forest canopy and phenological variation
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species diversity is vital for maintaining ecosystem functions, yet our ability to map the distribution of tree diversity is limited due to difficulties in traditional field-based approaches. Recent developments in spaceborne remote sensing provide unprecedented opportunities to map and monitor tree diversity more efficiently. Here we built partial least squares regression models using the multispectral surface reflectance acquired by Sentinel-2 satellites and the inventory data from 74 subtropical forest plots to predict canopy tree diversity in a national natural reserve in eastern China. In particular, we evaluated the underappreciated roles of the practical definition of forest canopy and phenological variation in predicting tree diversity by testing three different definitions of canopy trees and comparing models built using satellite imagery of different seasons. Our best models explained 42%-63% variations in observed diversities in cross-validation tests, with higher explanation power for diversity indices that are more sensitive to abundant species. The models built using imageries from early spring and late autumn showed consistently better fits than those built using data from other seasons, highlighting the significant role of transitional phenology in remotely sensing plant diversity. Our results suggested that the cumulative diameter (60%-80%) of the biggest trees is a better way to define the canopy layer than using the subjective fixeddiameter-threshold (5-12 cm) or the cumulative basal area (90%-95%) of the biggest trees. Remarkably, these approaches resulted in contrasting diversity maps that call attention to canopy structure in remote sensing of tree diversity. This study demonstrates the potential of mapping and monitoring tree diversity using the Sentinal-2 data in species-rich forests.

TI  - Leveraging "NightDay" Calibration Data to Correct Stripe Noise and Vignetting in SDGSAT-1 Nighttime-Light Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The challenge of performing relative radiometric correction on raw nighttime-light (NTL) images captured by the Glimmer Image for Urbanization (GIU) sensor of the SDGSAT-1 satellite is the presence of stripe noise and vignetting. To address this issue, this article presents a universal method for relative radiometric correction of NTL images captured by the push-broom system. A new automated approach to NTL pixel identification based on gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was developed to mask NTL ground object pixels from stripe noise, allowing for the calculation of credible stripe noise thresholds. The novel calibration data called "Night" orbital data were introduced for vignetting correction. The "Night" orbital data feature an abnormal transition zone that can be used to determine the vignetting correction parameters. The stripe noise thresholds and vignetting correction parameters can be applied to other raw orbital images. Experiments were conducted on raw images from different dates to verify the universality and robustness of the method, and the results were found to be superior to existing methods. A comparison was also made between the calibrated images and the original official Level-1 products, with the results indicating that the correction parameters calculated by the proposed method resolve the defects in the original Level-1 products. The correction parameters have been accepted by the official and have been used to update the original GIU Level-1 products. Finally, the results of relative radiometric correction on raw images from around the world further demonstrate the universality and credibility of the correction parameters.

TI  - Co- and Post-Seismic Mechanisms of the 2020 <i>Mw</i> 6.3 Yutian Earthquake and Local Stress Evolution
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mw 6.3 Yutian earthquake, occurred in northwestern Tibet on 25 June 2020, is one of the major events sequentially occurring in the region following the 2008 Mw 7.2, 2012 Mw 6.2, and 2014 Mw 6.9 earthquakes, and is of great significance for studying the tectonic activity and assessing future seismic hazards in the region. In this study, we used Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar images to retrieve co- and post-seismic deformation and to investigate the coseismic rupture behavior of the fault and the mechanisms of postseismic deformation. Based on the slip models of recent four nearby major earthquakes, we explored the local stress evolution, triggering mechanism of the 2020 event and future regional seismic hazards. Postseismic modeling reveals that afterslip on fault patches surrounding the ruptured co-seismic patches is the main mechanism responsible for the near-field deformation, with the poroelastic rebound relaxation only accounts for maximumly 25% of the ground displacement and limited impact on the overall deformation pattern. The Coulomb failure stress changes (Delta CFS) suggest that the 2020 Yutian earthquake was inhibited by the 2008 Mw 7.2 earthquake but facilitated by the 2012 Mw 6.2 and 2014 Mw 6.9 earthquakes, resulting in an overall Delta CFS with a large lateral gradient on the 2020 fault. Stress concentrations on nearby major faults indicate increasing chances of seismic hazards in the eastern section of the Altyn Tagh fault at 82.8 degrees E, the western section of the Guozha Co fault at 81.5 degrees E and the entire section of the Ashikule fault.Plain Language Summary The 2020 Mw 6.3 Yutian earthquake is one of the major events sequentially occurred following the 2008 Mw 7.2, 2012 Mw 6.2, and 2014 Mw 6.9 earthquakes in Yutian County. As large earthquakes result in stress perturbations altering regional seismicity, it provides great opportunity for studying the regional tectonic activity and assessing future seismic hazards. In this study, we investigated the coseismic rupture behavior of the 2020 earthquake and the mechanisms of postseismic deformation observed by radar observations. We also explored the local stress evolution, triggering mechanism of the 2020 event and future seismic hazards. Postseismic modeling indicates that afterslip is responsible for most of the near-field deformation, with the poroelastic rebound effect contributing only a small portion. Earthquakes prior to 2020 have generated considerable stress perturbations with complex patterns which may have triggered the 2020 Yutian earthquake. Stress concentrations on nearby faults indicate that future attention should be paid in the eastern section of the Altyn Tagh fault at 82.8 degrees E, the western section of the Guozha Co fault at 81.5 degrees E and the entire section of the Ashikule fault.

TI  - ExtSpecR: An R Package and Tool for Extracting Tree Spectra from UAV-Based Remote Sensing.
T2  - Plant phenomics (Washington, D.C.)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing has been increasingly applied in forestry for high-throughput and rapid acquisition of tree phenomics traits for various research areas. However, the detection of individual trees and the extraction of their spectral data remain a challenge, often requiring manual annotation. Although several software-based solutions have been developed, they are far from being widely adopted. This paper presents ExtSpecR, an open-source tool for spectral extraction of a single tree in forestry with an easy-to-use interactive web application. ExtSpecR reduces the time required for single tree detection and annotation and simplifies the entire process of spectral and spatial feature extraction from UAV-based imagery. In addition, ExtSpecR provides several functionalities with interactive dashboards that allow users to maximize the quality of information extracted from UAV data. ExtSpecR can promote the practical use of UAV remote sensing data among forest ecology and tree breeding researchers and help them to further understand the relationships between tree growth and its physiological traits.

TI  - Adversarial Spectral Super-Resolution for Multispectral Imagery Using Spatial Spectral Feature Attention Module
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Acquiring high-quality hyperspectral imagery with high spatial and spectral resolution plays an important role in remote sensing. Due to the limited capacity of sensors, providing high spatial and spectral resolution is still a challenging issue. Spectral super-resolution (SSR) increases the spectral dimensionality of multispectral images to achieve resolution enhancement. In this article, we propose a spectral resolution enhancement method based on the generative adversarial network framework without introducing additional spectral responses prior. In order to adaptively rescale informative features for capturing interdependencies in the spectral and spatial dimensions, a spatial spectral feature attention module is introduced. The proposed method jointly exploits spatio-spectral distribution in the hyperspectral manifold to increase spectral resolution while maintaining spatial content consistency. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 radiance data and real coregistered advanced land image and Hyperion (MS and HS) images, which indicates the superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

T2  - BMJ medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To measure the 90 day risk of arterial thromboembolism and venous thromboembolism among patients diagnosed with covid-19 in the ambulatory (ie, outpatient, emergency department, or institutional) setting during periods before and during covid-19 vaccine availability and compare results to patients with ambulatory diagnosed influenza.Design: Retrospective cohort study.Setting: Four integrated health systems and two national health insurers in the US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System.Participants: Patients with ambulatory diagnosed covid-19 when vaccines were unavailable in the US (period 1, 1 April-30 November 2020; n=272065) and when vaccines were available in the US (period 2, 1 December 2020-31 May 2021; n=342103), and patients with ambulatory diagnosed influenza (1 October 2018-30 April 2019; n=118618).Main outcome measures: Arterial thromboembolism (hospital diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke) and venous thromboembolism (hospital diagnosis of acute deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) within 90 days after ambulatory covid-19 or influenza diagnosis. We developed propensity scores to account for differences between the cohorts and used weighted Cox regression to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of outcomes with 95% confidence intervals for covid-19 during periods 1 and 2 versus influenza.Results: 90 day absolute risk of arterial thromboembolism with covid-19 was 1.01% (95% confidence interval 0.97% to 1.05%) during period 1, 1.06% (1.03% to 1.10%) during period 2, and with influenza was 0.45% (0.41% to 0.49%). The risk of arterial thromboembolism was higher for patients with covid-19 during period 1 (adjusted hazard ratio 1.53 (95% confidence interval 1.38 to 1.69)) and period 2 (1.69 (1.53 to 1.86)) than for patients with influenza. 90 day absolute risk of venous thromboembolism with covid-19 was 0.73% (0.70% to 0.77%) during period 1, 0.88% (0.84 to 0.91%) during period 2, and with influenza was 0.18% (0.16% to 0.21%). Risk of venous thromboembolism was higher with covid-19 during period 1 (adjusted hazard ratio 2.86 (2.46 to 3.32)) and period 2 (3.56 (3.08 to 4.12)) than with influenza.Conclusions: Patients diagnosed with covid-19 in the ambulatory setting had a higher 90 day risk of admission to hospital with arterial thromboembolism and venous thromboembolism both before and after covid-19 vaccine availability compared with patients with influenza.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring of Pine Wilt Disease Based on Time-Series Remote Sensing Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the strong influence of climate change and human activities, the frequency and intensity of disturbance events in the forest ecosystem both show significant increasing trends. Pine wood nematode (Bursapherenchus xylophilus, PWN) is one of the major alien invasive species in China, which has rapidly infected the forest and spread. In recent years, its tendency has been to spread from south to north, causing serious losses to Pinus and non-Pinus coniferous forests. It is urgent to carry out remote sensing monitoring and prediction of pine wilt disease (PWD). Taking Anhui Province as the study area, we applied ground survey, satellite-borne optical remote sensing imagery and environmental factor statistics, relying on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to build a new vegetation index NDFI based on time-series Landsat images to extract coniferous forest information and used a random forest classification algorithm to build a monitoring model of the PWD infection stage. The results show that the proposed NDFI differentiation threshold classification method can accurately extract the coniferous forest range, with the overall accuracy of 87.75%. The overall accuracy of the PWD monitoring model based on random forest classification reaches 81.67%, and the kappa coefficient is 0.622. High temperature and low humidity are conducive to the survival of PWN, which aggravates the occurrence of PWD. Under the background of global warming, the degree of PWD in Anhui Province has gradually increased, and has transferred from the southwest and south to the middle and northeast. Our results show that PWD monitoring and prediction at a regional scale can be realized by using long time-series multi-source remote sensing data, NDFI index can accurately extract coniferous forest information and grasp disease information in a timely manner, which is crucial for effective monitoring and control of PWD.

TI  - Interannual Variability of Remotely Sensed Phenology Relates to Plant Communities
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is considered an essential biological indicator in understanding the behavior of ecosystems and how they respond to environmental cues. However, the potential of interannual variations of remotely sensed phenology signals to differentiate plant types remains poorly understood, especially in understudied systems with highly heterogeneous landscapes such as wetlands. This study presents a case study in a San Francisco Bay area marsh that investigates the usefulness of interannual variation, defined as the root-mean-square error of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) measurements against a fitted phenology curve, at the beginning, middle, and end of the growing season as indicators of plant types. The study found that altitude above sea level and certain land surface phenology metrics, such as the day-of-the-year of the end of the season, the mid-autumn day, and the greening rate before the summer peak, were significantly related to these interannual variation trends. These results indicate that a detailed time-series analysis at the beginning and end of growing seasons may enhance large-scale wetland characterization. Overall, the findings of this study contribute to our understanding of vegetation phenology and provide a framework for more accurate wetland classification in future studies.

TI  - Total Nitrogen in forage corn (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) estimated by satelliteSentinel2 spectral indices
T2  - TERRA LATINOAMERICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen is the most important nutrient for forage crops because of its contribution in various biochemical reactions in the dif ferent phenological stages of the plant. The main aim of this study is to develop a multiple linear regression model to estimate total nitrogen (Nt) in corn plants using spectral indexes. The percentage of total nitrogen (Nt) was determined through three plant samplings in four experimental plots. The estimation model was obtained to process the Sentinel-2 satellite images according to the plant sampling dates; 13 spectral indexes were calculated and the association between nitrogen and the reflectance values was analyzed by the principal component analysis (ACP), correlation matrix, and dendrogram. The indexes with the highest relationship were MCARI / OSAVI, TCARI / OSAVI, MCARI / OSAVI RE and TCARI / OSAVI RE, explaining more than 50% of the variability of the proposed model and a MSE of 0.12. This study indicates that the estimation obtained from Sentinel-2 spectral indexes images has great potential to determine nitrogen in crops. However, for future research, Nt estimation models should be obtained for each phenological crop stage.

TI  - Geographic-social conceptualization of the place-site duality: defining the object of contemporary Geography
T2  - CUADERNOS GEOGRAFICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay aims to review the semantic potential of the central notions of Geography, exploring with their (re)conceptualization the capacity to communicate the rationality of those who evoke them, as well as the intentionality of the geographical object represented. Methodologically, crit-ical hermeneutics is effective to access the social structure behind the traces of a regulated and commonly accepted geographic language without discussion, resulting in a necessary propos-al, alternative to the dialectical treatment of space and place: the place-site dialectic, useful to demonstrate that in every representation there is ideology and worldview, as well as that in the production of space practices are imposed based on an idea of material and symbolic progress contrary to human progress. In the current context of cultural struggle, the sense that geograph-ical representation acquires according to the use and meaning of terms places us in favor of one side or the other. The need for a critical essay of these characteristics is only such if we aspire to revive the value of a social, critical and emancipating Geography with respect to the principles and values that empty all geography of space and society.

T2  - PloS one
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Worldwide urbanization drives rural-urban transformation (RUT) which has major consequences in many countries of the Global South where there is an urgent need to better understand and manage the underlying processes and consequences for ecosystem services. To fill existing knowledge gaps on the extent and time course of RUT in Morocco, this study focused on (i) analyzing the spatial patterns of rural-urban transformation in the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra (RSK) region from 1972 to 2020, (ii) identifying key mechanisms of change, and (iii) defining the main driving forces behind the spatial transformation patterns. To this end, we processed data of the Landsat free archive, historical grayscale Corona images, and nighttime lights datasets on Google Earth Engine (GEE) using machine learning classifiers and LandTrendr spectral-temporal segmentation algorithms. With an overall accuracy (OA) ranging from 88-95%, the results revealed that during the study period the RSK region experienced a 473% growth of horizontal built-up reflected in an area increase from 63.4 km2 to 299.9 km2. The main changes occurred along the Kenitra-Rabat-Temara axis and in central cities connected to the main road network. The horizontal expansion of large and medium-sized cities led to the formation of a Rural-Urban Interface (RUI) on the outskirts. The urban sprawl of some cities has affected the surrounding rural lands within the RUI. Environmental, social, economic, and political forces have interacted in shaping the changes in rural-urban landscapes.

TI  - Fire regime of peatlands in the Angolan Highlands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Angolan Highlands region includes the Angolan miombo woodland ecoregion which supports miombo woodland, grasslands, subsistence agricultural land, and peatland deposits. Extensive fires, slash and burn agriculture, peat fuel extraction, and peatland drainage are among the anthropogenic practices that threaten these peatland deposits. Peat fires cause peatland degradation, release significant amounts of greenhouse gases, deteriorate air quality, and contribute towards climate change and biodiversity loss. This study presents an analysis of the fire regimes over the period 2001 to 2020 in an under-studied area of the Angolan Highlands. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire and vegetation data were used in combination with a land use/land cover (LULC) classification map to calculate fire frequency, burn area, and fire regimes. The fire patterns within the study site are comparable to those found in African woodland savannas. Across the study site, 6976 km(2) (11.31%) of the land surface area burned at least nine times from 2001 to 2020, occurring largely within in the river valley environment. Considering the different LULC classes, peatlands were calculated to (a) burn more frequently (average fire frequency from 2001 to 2020 = 9.12), (b) have the smallest proportion (4.11%) of area which remained unburnt over the fire archive, and (c) have the largest average proportion (45.65% or 746 km(2)) of burnt area per year. Peatland burning occurred predominantly during drier months from May to September. The results of this study highlight the strong influence of LULC on the fire frequency and distribution in the study area, requiring unique fire management strategies. As has been documented for boreal and tropical peatlands across the globe, we stress the importance of peatland conservation and protection; continued unsustainable management practices may lead to the loss of these important peatland deposits.

TI  - Precipitable water vapor fusion of MODIS and ERA5 based on convolutional neural network
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensing precipitable water vapor (PWV) in the earth's atmosphere is of significant importance for contributing to severe weather event monitoring and forecasting. PWV can be measured and retrieved with various techniques of different accuracies and spatial and temporal resolutions. In this study, we aim to achieve PWV estimates of high accuracy and resolutions by fusing the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF) global reanalyzes (ERA5) with convolutional neural network (CNN). The region is focused on the west coast of America, and the experimental duration lasts for three years, from 2019 to 2021. The fused PWV values reveal a good agreement with the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) PWV, showing a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.9 mm and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.3 mm. The fused PWV demonstrates significant improvement in accuracy compared to MODIS PWV estimates, with the MAE and RMSE reduced by 75.3% and 72.4%. Meanwhile, they also outperform the ERA5 PWV, revealing decreases of 34.6% in RMSE and 35.2% in MAE, respectively. Besides, the multilayer perceptron algorithm is also applied in PWV fusion as a comparison, which reveals a worse performance than the CNN fusion model. Furthermore, the fused PWV is less affected by seasonal variations and can provide more detailed spatial features compared to MODIS and ERA5 PWV. The proposed approach contributes to exploiting the full potential of MODIS and ERA5 products and offers promising potential for meteorological applications.

TI  - Ecological Water Demand Estimations for Desert Terminal Lake Survival under Inland River Water Diversion Regulation
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Desert terminal lakes are important signals to discern ecological degradation crises, particularly in arid areas where an artificial project of ecological water diversion has designated a quota of river water to prevent lake body shrinkage and protect the ecosystem. Knowledge of the minimum ecological water demand (EWD) is thus necessary to ensure the basic health of lake ecosystems. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal evolution of water boundaries using Landsat satellites data via remote sensing technology from 2002 to 2017 in East Juyan Lake, an inland desert terminal lake of the Heihe River in northwest China. The minimum lake water demand was determined using two estimation methods: the lake-evaporation-oriented EWD method and the minimum water level method. In the latter method, both lake topography (using water-level area curves) and biological survival demands (using bighead carps as indicators) were considered to derive the minimum lake EWD. Water diversion to the lake over the past 15 years has increased the lake's area, but there are still marked intra-annual seasonal variations. The annual minimum lake water demand was suggested to be 54 x 10(6) m(3)/year by comparing the different methods; however, it was not satisfied, and the lake survival was endangered when the occurrence frequency of the annual runoff in the Zhengyixia hydrological station exceeded 65%. This study offered promising directions for inland lake water resource management.

TI  - MT-InSAR Unveils Dynamic Permafrost Disturbances in Hoh Xil (Kekexili) on the Tibetan Plateau Hinterland
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hoh Xil is an uninhabited extremity secluded on the Tibetan Plateau hinterland. A complete mapping of ground motion variation in Hoh Xil is essential for an in-depth understanding of the terrain's responses to climate change on the Tibetan Plateau. However, the inaccessibility and extremely harsh environment impeded extensive field investigations on landform alteration and its formative process. Such difficulty can be resolved by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), which enables a broad detection of subtle permafrost motions at millimeter precision. This study, for the first time, accomplished a multitemporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) deformation mapping from 2015 to 2020 in Hoh Xil, with a wide coverage of about 200 000 km(2). 1592 Sentinel-1 images were processed based on the small baseline subset (SBAS) technique. The results show that Hoh Xil was experiencing dynamic permafrost disturbances. Thawing permafrost with both a linear subsidence rate higher than 2 mm/year and a periodic amplitude over 2 mm was primarily detected in areas of flat or gentle slopes. The InSAR cumulative deformation is highly correlated with permafrost thawing depth. Significant lag times were identified between seasonal oscillation of InSAR deformation and land surface temperature (LST). Thermokarst landforms of retrogressive thaw slumps and thermokarst lakes broadly formed and dynamically evolved as a consequence of permafrost degradation. Particularly, widespread thawing permafrost characterized by the spatial clustering of thermokarst lakes appeared to occur in areas adjacent to large lakes. The discovered dynamic permafrost disturbances in Hoh Xil manifested even the secluded Tibetan Plateau hinterland was facing the threat of climate change.

TI  - Arctic Sea Ice and Open Water Classification From Spaceborne Fully Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an approach for automatic classification of Arctic sea ice and open water from spaceborne C-band RADARSAT-2 fully polarimetric (HH, HV, VH, VV) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery based on the random forest (RF) model. The HH- and HV-polarized radar backscatter, incidence angle, and optimal polarimetric features are inputs of the RF model. First, we use a physics-based unsupervised scheme to generate well-annotated sea ice and open water samples. This scheme can alleviate labeling errors arising from visual interpretation or temporal-spatial mismatch between SAR images and operational ice charts. Subsequently, we estimate a set of characteristic polarimetric parameters and select the most representative features using the recursive feature elimination method. Finally, the RF model is trained and validated using more than one million labeled samples. Statistical validation results show that the overall sea ice and water classification accuracy is 99.94% and the Kappa coefficient is 0.999. We find that ice-water discrimination accuracy can be improved by about 4%-10% when optimal polarimetric features are involved in the RF model input. Moreover, the polarization difference (PD, VV-HH) is found to be the foremost polarimetric parameter for distinguishing sea ice from open water. The proposed approach has the capability of yielding satisfactory ice-water classification over the complicated marginal ice zone. High-resolution ice-water classification maps clearly show that sea ice leads and their surroundings are also well separated.

TI  - Remote-Sensing Interpretation for Soil Elements Using Adaptive Feature Fusion Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil elements refer to different types of soils with unique colors, textures, and particle sizes. Their interpretation is essential for agriculture, ecological environment, and land permeability assessment. This typically requires experts with dual knowledge of geology and remote sensing. With the increasing volume of remote-sensing data, the traditional "visual interpretation" and "field survey" technique is no longer sufficient to meet the demands. Because of the challenges such as the fine structure of soil, complex and variable natural scenes, and strong spatial variability, there remains a considerable gap between the accuracy of deep-learning-based methods and expert interpretation. To improve the accuracy of intelligent soil elements interpretation, this study proposes a soil interpretation framework coupling implicit knowledge with a multispectral image (SIFCIM). This framework quantifies implicit knowledge (IK), such as interpretation symbol and terrain feature, into matrix data [interpretation symbol distance (ISD) field and digital elevation model (DEM)]. To align with the SIFCIM, an IK-guided adaptive feature fusion network (IAFFNet) is constructed, which enhances the utilization efficiency of auxiliary features through an adaptive implicit feature fusion (AIF) module and a global feature dependence (GFD) module. Experimental results demonstrate that IAFFNet outperforms interpretation methods with a single remote-sensing image, achieving approximately 4.34% and 6.62% improvements in overall pixel accuracy (oPA) and mean intersection over union (mIoU), respectively. These results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the IK-guided approach in soil elements interpretation. To our knowledge, this work is the first to apply the concept of IK to soil elements interpretation, providing a novel insight for related research.

TI  - Land-Use and Land-Cover Change Detection and Classification to Analyze Dynamics of Dragon Fruit Farming in Sand Dunes Area of Binh Thuan Province of Vietnam
T2  - ADVANCES IN GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGY IN MINING AND EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Geospatial Technologies and Earth Resources (GTER)
CL  - Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Hanoi, VIETNAM
AB  - Mapping of land use and land covers (LULCs) and their temporal changes are important subjects in remote sensing field. This study applies change detection and classification (CDC) in mapping and analyzing changes of dragon fruits area in sand dunes area of Binh Thuan province using MODIS NDVI time-series data from 2000 to 2020. Unlike the single-phase classification which assumes unchanged LULC in analyzed periods, the CDC divided time series into segments defined by change points for segment classification. The per-pixel change detection using Pelt method identified 18 wide-scaled change points in study area. Afterward, two-phased multi-class classification was conducted to delineate dragon fruit area using the Random Forest algorithm with statistical features of four time-series segments representing four periods 2000-2005, 2005-2010, 2010-2015, and 2015-2020. A robust paradigm combining validation of classification results with area estimation was applied to analyze changing of dragon fruit areas. The result suggests a steady increase of dragon fruit areas in sand dune areas of Binh Thuan province from 2000 to 2020 especially in two districts Ham Thuan Bac and Ham Thuan Nam and recent conversions to dragon fruits in Bac Binh, Tuy Phong, and La Gi districts.

TI  - Analyzing Gradual Vegetation Changes in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region Using Landsat Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil sand mining in northern Alberta/Canada in the Athabasca region is a major intrusion into the otherwise pristine natural environment. The various types of oil sands mining, transport, and processing are causing large-scale discharge of pollutants. Accordingly, this study examined the gradual changes in the physically undisturbed vegetation, that occurred from 1984 to 2021 in the Athabasca oil sands monitoring region. First, the abrupt changes were masked out with the help of auxiliary and Landsat data. Subsequently, a normalized burn ratio Landsat time-series was applied to the LandTrendr algorithm on the Google Earth Engine. In order to interpret gradual changes, measurement criteria were used to describe vegetation development, vulnerability, and variability. In addition, the spatial and temporal relationship of these to oil sand opencast mines, processing facilities, and steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) mines was examined. The results showed that a major part of the vegetation in the Athabasca oil sand monitoring region underwent a positive development (65.9%). However, around the opencast mines a negative vegetation development and stability within a radius of 10 km could be observed. In the surroundings of processing facilities, the development and stability of vegetation was disturbed within a radius of 2 km. Thereby the analysis of land cover classes showed that deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forest are disproportionately affected. Conversely, no negative influences on neighboring vegetation could be detected around SAGD mines. The temporal analysis showed that vegetation disturbance was most pronounced between 1990 and 2000, but recovered in recent years.

TI  - A Cross-sectional Survey on Rodent Environmental Health Monitoring Practices: Benchmarking, Associations, and Barriers
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tens of thousands of rodents are used each year in Rodent Health Monitoring programs. However, Environment Health Monitoring (EHM) could replace sentinel rodent use while maintaining or even improving diagnostic quality. Despite its advantages, widespread implementation of EHM appears to be relatively low. To better understand EHM's prevalence and factors influencing its use, we surveyed research animal professionals. Our hypotheses were (1) EHM prevalence would be low and (2) EHM use would be associated with beliefs and knowledge about EHM. Participants were recruited via online promotion. A total of 158 individuals completed a mixed-methods survey about current practices, beliefs, and knowledge about EHM. Qualitative data were coded using thematic analysis and analyzed using generalized linear models. Results showed that current EHM implementation was low; only 11% of institutions used EHM exclusively. Across the 111 institutions surveyed, over 20,000 soiled bedding sentinels were used each year. However, most participants believed EHM to be advantageous in replacing sentinel animals (78% of participants). Some participants believed EHM could save time (31%), cost less (27%), and be highly accurate (15%). Conversely, some participants believed EHM would be difficult to use due to their current caging type (40%), higher costs (21%), lower accuracy (16%), and personnel attitudes/expertise (14%). Overall, respondents with higher planned EHM use also had more positive attitudes, norms, and control of EHM. We also identified several factors that could promote the implementation of EHM. Communication efforts should emphasize that EHM is compatible with various types of caging, can provide cost savings, has high accuracy, and is consistent with the 3Rs as a replacement. Efforts should also focus on improving attitudes, encouraging peers, and providing resources to facilitate implementation. Implementation in just the surveyed institutions could eliminate the need for well over 20,000 rodents each year, consistent with 3Rs goals.

TI  - Innovations and Strategies During Online Teaching in an EdTech Low-Resourced University.
T2  - SN computer science
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The study focused on identifying innovations deployed by lecturers when teaching online during the COVID-19 pandemic at the University of Zambia. The interpretivist worldview anchors the study. Researchers adopted a descriptive qualitative case study design. Purposefully and conveniently sampled lecturers (n=21) took part in key informant interviews from the university faculties: the school of education, the school of humanities and social sciences and the school of health sciences. Thematic analyses were applied to the data collected using face-to-face and telephone interview schedules. Results show that all lecturers fully know online instruction's possible challenges. Lecturers have devised innovations that are lecturer-oriented, lesson-oriented, resource-oriented and student-oriented in managing online teaching and learning. The success of online teaching in an EdTech low-resourced university depends on the lecturers' desire to learn, the availability of essential ICT devices, the use of open educational resources-OER, the potential of the use of devices and the availability of internet connectivity. However, intermittent internet connectivity, student absenteeism, a lack of primary ICT devices, and EdTech illiteracy persist. External support-such as continuous professional development programs (CPDs), import duty exemptions or corporate sponsorships and donations-should be sought to facilitate online lessons. Innovation in teaching and learning does not only entail high-tech educational technologies but the use of what works best for a community of learners in a particular context. Though focused on Zambia, the study results reflect the situation and experience of universities in other countries with similar characteristics.

AB  - This is a replication dataset for the publication titled: "Rhinovirus transmission dynamics across different social structures ." This dataset aims to compare rhinovirus dynamics from five previous studies conducted in Kenya in four different social structures. The studies are (i) intensive household surveillance in coastal Kenya (Dec 2009 - May 2010), (ii) surveillance of respiratory viruses within a public primary school (May 2017 - April 2018), (iii) outpatient surveillance of acute respiratory illness within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) (Dec 2015 - Nov 2016), and (iv) countrywide surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome illness (SARI) among inpatients and influenza-like illness (ILI) among outpatients via sentinel hospital reporting (Jan 2014 - Dec 2014). (v) We used contemporaneous data from long-term surveillance of severe pneumonia among pediatric inpatients at the Kilifi County Hospital (KCH) for comparison with the households, school, and KHDSS studies datasets. The primary dataset contains VP4/2 sequence data, alongside necessary metadata (e.g. date of sampling, site where collection, respective study). Secondary datasets generated from the primary data are also included (described in section 4 - Contents).

TI  - Assessment of Machine Learning Methods for Urban Types Classification Using Integrated SAR and Optical Images in Nonthaburi, Thailand
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization and expansion in each city of emerging countries have become an essential function of Earth's surface, with the majority of people migrating from rural to urban regions. The various urban category characteristics have emphasized the great importance of understanding and creating suitable land evaluations in the future. The overall objective of this study is to classify the urban zone utilizing building height which is estimated using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and various satellite-based indexes of Sentinel-2A. The first objective of this research is to estimate the building height of the Sentinel-1 SAR in Nonthaburi, Thailand. A new indicator, vertical-vertical-horizontal polarization (VVH), which can provide a better performance, is produced from the dual-polarization information, vertical-vertical (VV), and vertical-horizontal (VH). Then, the building height model was developed using indicator VVH and the reference building height data. The root means square error (RMSE) between the estimated and reference height is 1.413 m. Then, the second objective is to classify three classes of urban types, which are composed of residential buildings, commercial buildings, and other buildings, including vegetation, waterbodies, car parks, and so on. Spectral indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and normalized difference built up the index (NDBI) are extracted from the Sentinel-2A data. To classify the urban types, a three-machine learning classifier, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) were developed. The classification uses randomly trained data from each 500 m focus study which are divided into a 100 x 100 m grid. Different models are examined using different variables, for example, classification using only building height and only spectral indices. The indices and estimated building height were used to classify the urban types. Not only the average of various satellite-based indices and building height of 100 x 100 m grid was used, but also the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation were calculated from NDVI, NDWI, NDBI, and building height. There are a total of 16 variables used in the model. Eventually, the principal components analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the variables and get better performance of the models. SVM showed better accuracy than the other two, RF and KNN. The accuracies of SVM, RF, and KNN are 0.86, 0.75, and 0.76, respectively.

TI  - TRCDNet: A Transformer Network for Video Cloud Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote-sensing image (RSI) preprocessing steps, detecting and removing cloudy areas is a critical task. Recently, cloud detection methods based on deep neural networks achieve outstanding performance over traditional methods. Current approaches mostly focus on cloud detection on a single image captured by polar-orbiting satellites. However, there is another type of meteorological satellite-geostationary satellite, which can capture temporal consecutive frames of a particular location. Therefore, the cloud detection task targeting a geostationary satellite can be treated as a video cloud detection task. And in addition to extracting features on a single image, extracting and making full use of the relations between sequential frames is also important. To tackle this problem, we design a deep-learning video cloud detection model: transformer network for video cloud detection (TRCDNet). The proposed network is based on the encoder-decoder structure. In the encoder, the module ContextGhostLayer is proposed to encode more semantic information to tackle challenging problems like thin clouds in RSIs. Besides, we design a transformer-based video sequence transformer (VSTR) block. Based on the attention mechanism, VSTR can fully extract the across-frame relations. In the proposed decoder, the cloud masks are recovered gradually to the same scale as the input image. To evaluate the methods, we create a Video Cloud Detection dataset based on the captured videos from Fengyun 4 (FY-4) satellite: Fengyun4aCloud. Extensive experiments of current cloud detection methods, semantic segmentation methods, and video semantic segmentation (VSS) methods indicate that the designed TRCDNet achieves state-of-art performance in video cloud detection.

TI  - Multiview Learning for Impervious Surface Mapping Using High-Resolution Multispectral Imagery and LiDAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of multisource remote sensing data to obtain urban impervious surface has become a popular research topic. Multisource remote sensing data fusion techniques can provide object interpretation with a higher accuracy. However, most decision-level fusion methods make insufficient use of the complementary information and degree of association between similar object data. To fill this gap, in this article, we propose a dual-view learning fusion classification method (DvLF) based on multiview learning. First, DvLF uses cotraining algorithm to combine multiple data sources for accurate classification, extracting easy-to-classify area while separating difficult-to-classify regions for further analysis. Second, a canonical correlation analysis method is adopted to mine the degree of association of similar object data for constructing a subspace projection field of each object sample. The data in the difficult-to-classify regions are classified in the projection field of each object, and then the results of each classification are fused by voting. Finally, the classification results of the two regions are combined into the classification results of the whole image to achieve impervious surface mapping. The proposed method is applied to the dual-sensor (high-resolution image and LiDAR) Buffalo dataset and the dual-sensor (RGB and multispectral LiDAR) Houston dataset. The experimental results show that our method achieved a significant improvement in classification accuracy compared to other methods. The overall classification accuracy of this new DvLF fusion method on the Buffalo and Houston datasets is 83.35% and 88.84%, respectively, leading to accurate high-resolution impervious surface mapping.

TI  - HY-1C/D CZI Image Atmospheric Correction and Quantifying Suspended Particulate Matter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - HY-1C/D both carry a coastal zone imager (CZI) with a spatial resolution of 50 m and a swath width of 950 km, two observations can be achieved in three days when two satellites operating in a network. Accurate atmospheric correction is the basis for quantitative inversion of ocean color parameters using CZI However, atmospheric correction in estuarine and coastal waters with complex optical properties is a challenge due to the band setting of CZI. This paper proposed a novel atmospheric correction algorithm for CZI images applicable to turbid waters in estuarine and coastal zone. The Rayleigh scattering reflectance of CZI was calculated based on a vector radiative transfer model. Next, a semi-empirical radiative transfer model with suspended particle concentration as the parameter is used to model the water-atmosphere coupling. Finally, the parameters of the coupling model are solved by combining a global optimization method based on a genetic algorithm. The results indicate that the CZI-derived remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) are in good agreement with the quasi-synchronous Landsat-8/9 operational land imager (OLI) derived R-rs in the green and red bands (R-2 > 0.96). Validation using in situ data revealed that the RMSE of the CZI-derived R-rs in the green and red bands was 0.0036 sr(-1) and 0.0035 sr(-1). More importantly, the values and spatial distributions of suspended particulate matter (SPM) estimated by CZI and those estimated by OLI in the Subei Shoal and the Yangtze River Estuary are basically consistent, and the validation using in situ data revealed that the inversion of SPM concentration by CZI was effective (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.0362 g/L), indicating that CZI has great potential and broad application prospects for monitoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of SPM in estuarine and coastal waters. The study results will lay the foundation for further estimating suspended sediment fluxes and carbon fluxes, thus providing data support and scientific basis for promoting resource development, utilization and conservation strategies in estuarine and coastal areas.

M3  - Review
AB  - Wood-boring pests (WBPs) pose an enormous threat to global forest ecosystems because their early stage infestations show no visible symptoms and can result in rapid and widespread infestations at later stages, leading to large-scale tree death. Therefore, early-stage WBP detection is crucial for prompt management response. Early detection of WBPs requires advanced and effective methods like remote sensing. This review summarizes the applications of various remote sensing sensors, platforms, and detection methods for monitoring WBP infestations. The current capabilities, gaps in capabilities, and future potential for the accurate and rapid detection of WBPs are highlighted.

TI  - Microbiota and environmental health monitoring of mouse colonies by metagenomic shotgun sequencing
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) allows the monitoring of microbiota composition of murine colonies employed for scientific purposes in a single test by assessing the composition of gut microbiome and the detection of pathogens from fecal pellets. In this study, we tested the potential use of mNGS for monitoring both microbiota composition and the presence of pathogens through Environmental Health Monitoring, by using exhaust dust collection filters derived from individually ventilated cages (IVC) systems. mNGS analysis was performed on nucleic acids isolated from filters collecting air from the exhaust of: (1) cages with mice housed in a non-pathogen free facility; (2) animal-free cages with clean chow and bedding from the same facility; (3) cages housing mice from a specific-pathogen free (SPF) facility. mNGS results revealed correspondence between microbiome composition from fecal pellets and filter, including pathogenic bacteria (Helicobacter hepaticus, Helicobacter typhlonius, Chlamydia muridarum, Rodentibacter pneumotropicus, Citrobacter rodentium), intestinal protozoa (Tritrichomonas muris, Spironucleus muris) nematoda (Aspiculuris tetraptera) and eukaryotic parasites (Myocoptes musculinus), present in the colony. Entamoeba muris and Syphacia obvelata were detected in fecal pellets but not in filter. The animal free exhaust dust filter, exposed to clean cages (no mice) placed in the IVC after removal of all mice, exhibited the presence of the same pathogens due to contaminated connecting pipes, confirming the sensitivity of the approach. Conversely, the filter from SPF colony revealed the absence of pathogens. The current use of exhaust dust collection filters in health surveillance requires multiple molecular tests to identify specific pathogens and does not provide information on the colony microbiome. This work provides the proof-of-principle that assaying exhaust dust collection filters by mNGS for microbiota monitoring of laboratory mice is feasible. In its daily application, results suggest the usefulness of the test in SPF facilities, where pathogenic micro-organisms are expected to be absent. mNGS analysis of exhaust dust collection filters allows the analysis of multiple cages, reducing the number of tests required for pathogen detection and corresponding costs, and avoiding the use of sentinel mice.

Remote sensing images can be used to effectively monitor landslides at a large scale, which is of great significance for pre-disaster warning and post-disaster assistance. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have made great progress in the field of remote sensing image landslide detection. In remote sensing images, landslides display a variety of scales and shapes. In this article, to better extract and keep the multiscale shape information of landslides, a shape-enhanced vision transformer (ShapeFormer) model is proposed. For the feature extraction, a pyramid vision transformer (PVT) model is introduced, which directly models the global information of local elements at different scales. To learn the shape information of different landslides, a shape feature extraction branch is designed, which uses the adjacent feature maps at different scales in the PVT model to improve the boundary information. After the feature extraction step, a decoder with deconvolutional layers follows, which combines the multiple features and gradually recovers the original resolution of the combined features. A softmax layer is connected with the combined features to acquire the final pixel-wise result. The proposed ShapeFormer model was tested on two public datasets-the Bijie dataset and the Nepal dataset-which have different spectral and spatial characteristics. The results, when compared with those of some of the state-of-the-art methods, show the potential of the proposed method for use with multisource optical remote sensing data for landslide detection.

TI  - Optimization of Characteristic Phenological Periods for Winter Wheat Extraction Using Remote Sensing in Plateau Valley Agricultural Areas in Hualong, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to develop or validate remote sensing methods to explore agricultural management and food self-sufficiency in the agricultural areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau under the influence of global change, ecological protection, and socio-economic development. Studies on the use of remote sensing to monitor crop planting on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are limited, with inconclusive results. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed Sentinel-2A/B images and field survey data in Hualong, China (located in Hehuang Valley, Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau) for winter wheat identification and verification at different spatial scales based on the time series of the normalized difference phenology index (NDPI) and dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. The characteristic phenological period and the corresponding DTW threshold were optimized using remote sensing data extracted for winter wheat. The results showed that NDPI corresponding to the jointing-heading stage, grouting-harvesting stage, and jointing-harvesting stage with DTW could identify winter wheat regardless of whether the spatial scale was a single quadrat, a combination of two quadrats, or the entire study area. The NDPI corresponding to the jointing-heading stage (corresponding DTW threshold T = 0.158) could generate a relatively rational winter wheat map; the NDPI corresponding to the time series of the grouting-harvesting stage (combined with DTW threshold T = 0.195) could detect a planting area with relatively high accuracy when supported by cultivated land, which matches the statistical reporting of the winter wheat area data. Similarly, with the support of cultivated land data, the planted area could be identified early based on the phenological characteristics of winter wheat before overwintering; however, the extraction scheme needs to be optimized further.

TI  - Mitigate the LFM-PRFI in SAR Data: Joint Down-Range and Cross-Range Filtering
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), an active remote sensing equipment, shares the spectrum with devices in the same frequency band and is, therefore, easy to affect by pulse radio frequency interference (PRFI). The wideband version of PRFI, i.e., linear-frequency-modulation PRFI (LFM-PRFI), derived from the ground- and space-based radar sensors is a challenging issue for SAR because it usually has a large bandwidth and pulsewidth compared with the traditional PRFI. The well-known notch filtering methods, including time- and frequency-domain versions, are robust approaches against PRFI, which has been integrated into some SAR ground processing systems. However, the down-range frequency-domain notch filtering will increase the sidelobes of the targets when mitigating wideband LFM-PRFI, whereas the time-domain version will introduce ghosts when notching large pulsewidth ones. This article proposed a filtering method that consists of three steps to tackle the above problems. The first step is focusing the energy of LFM-PRFI down-range and cross-range simultaneously, which can be done by match filtering and Fourier transform. The second step is mitigating the LFM-PRFI, which can be done by a designed filter. The last step is data restoration, which can be done by multiplying the conjugate of the phase function used before. Numerical experiments based on simulated SAR data and measured spaceborne SAR data acquired by European Sentinel-1 are performed to test the mitigation performance, which verified the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

TI  - The projects of doctrine of worldview in the light of lingua-cultural analysis
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA I KONFLIKTOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper proposes a diachronic study of the worldview phenomenon by the means of lingua-conceptual analysis, together with genealogical method. The study consists of three issues. First, to compare the cultural and linguistic specifications of worldview problematic in German, Rus-sian, and Anglo-American philosophical cultures. Further, to discover disciplinary intersections of those branches of knowledge, in which these doctrines of worldview are in demand. Finally, to compare the status of such doctrines in current philosophy, taking into account the prevail-ing epistemological attitudes in the German-, Russian-and English-language traditions. The identified similarities and differences in the ideas about the essence and tasks of the doctrine of worldview will make it possible either to assert that worldview problematic fits into the historical and philosophical perspective as a unit-idea, or to disprove it. Among the similarities identified in these philosophical cultures, it should be noted: shaping of an integrative system of views, in-cluding elements of both "scientific" and "non-scientific" philosophy; combination of the logical set of argumentations with the creative freedom of research; rethinking the principle of self-care by creating a holistic conceptual picture of the world. The latter includes not only axiological and anthropological identification strategies, but also the substantiation of the starting positions on which these pictures of the world are built. The revealed differences concern the discursive practices that substantiate these pictures of the world. Those practices are: scientific, traditional (including religious), linguistic (including communicative), and they can also intertwine each other. An analysis of modern authors' doctrines of worldview shows the relevance of worldview issues in the perspective of the "perennial philosophy" project. At the same time, the current paper demonstrates that the modern doctrines of worldview can be conceptually considered as a way of understanding and criticism of modern culture.

AB  - With the ever-increasing amount of satellite missions in orbit, Earth observation and remote sensing have advanced rapidly and are applied in a multitude of fields, such as ecosystem monitoring and natural disaster prevention. At the same time, more and more machine-learning architectures are developed, which attempt to map and detect pixel-scale changes on the Earth's surface. Such an application is forest monitoring, which is deemed nowadays highly critical, considering the threat of deforestation on a global scale. However, the spatial resolution of available open-source satellite imagery is limited. One way to address this issue is to augment the remote sensing imagery resolution using Image Super Resolution Networks.The goal of this work is to perform the Semantic Segmentation task with Sentinel-2 satellite images in order to detect forest areas. Three Deep Neural Network architectures are trained and tested. Moreover, we use a Super Resolution Deep Network to augment the resolution of the images. We create two datasets, one with original Sentinel-2 images and one with super-resolved images. We train the three architectures on the two datasets independently and we test them on a test set which combines original and super-resolved images. We show that Swin Transformer produces the best results, while training on the super-resolved images enhances the modeling power of all architectures.

T2  - DOKLADY NATSIONALNOI AKADEMII NAUK BELARUSI
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of improving the WRF numerical weather model performance for the territory of Belarus by assimilating the Earth remote sensing data is considered. It is shown that for the winter period, the use of satellite data of high spatial resolution, including on the structure of land use , albedo, leaf index and photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the underlying surface can reduce a root-mean-square error of the short-term forecast (up to 48 h) of the air surface temperature by 0.53-1.11 degrees C. For the summer period, on the basis of numerical experiments the optimal correction factor for the land surface albedo was estimated. This made it possible to reduce a root-mean-square error of temperature forecast at the meteorological stations of Belarus for the lead time of +12, +24, +36, and +48 h by an average of 0.30 degrees C, 0.10 degrees C, 0.15 degrees C, and 0.16 degrees C, respectively.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prognosis for patients with melanoma has improved due to better treatments in recent years and updated tools to accurately predict an individual's risk are warranted. This study aims to describe a prognostic instrument for patients with cutaneous melanoma and its potential as a clinical device for treatment decisions.METHODS: Patients with localised invasive cutaneous melanoma diagnosed in 1990-2021 with data on tumour thickness were identified from the population-based Swedish Melanoma Registry. The parametric Royston-Parmar (RP) method was used to estimate melanoma-specific survival (MSS) probabilities. Separate models were constructed for patients (≤1mm) and (>1mm) and prognostic groups were created based on all combinations of age, sex, tumour site, tumour thickness, absence/presence of ulceration, histopathologic type, Clark's level of invasion, mitoses and sentinel lymph node (SLN) status.RESULTS: In total, 72616 patients were identified, 41764 with melanoma ≤1mm and 30852 with melanoma >1mm. The most important variable was tumour thickness for both (≤1mm) and (>1mm), that explained more than 50% of the survival. The second most important variables were mitoses (≤1mm) and SLN status (>1mm). The prognostic instrument successfully created probabilities for >30000 prognostic groups.CONCLUSIONS: The Swedish updated population-based prognostic instrument, predicts MSS survival up to 10 years after diagnosis. The prognostic instrument gives more representative and up-to-date prognostic information for Swedish patients with primary melanoma than the present AJCC staging. Additional to clinical use and the adjuvant setting, the information retrieved could be used to plan future studies.

TI  - Classification With Unbalanced Samples by Self-Sampling and Semicorrelated Co-Training-An Application to Algal Bloom Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine-learning-based methods provide attractive solutions to algal bloom detection. However, the effective utilization of training sets remains a crucial challenge. Taking the extraction of Ulva prolifera as an example, to improve the detection accuracy, this manuscript presents a model based on self-sampling and semicorrelated co-training. The self-sampling module comprises balanced sampling and gradient descent to enhance the efficiency of extracting useful information from U.prolifera training sets. Balanced sampling optimizes the distribution of sampling points, while gradient descent determines the optimal number of sampling points. During the iteration process, useful information will be continuously extracted driven by the self-sampling module as the input of training for the subsequent machine-learning algorithm. The classical semisupervised machine-learning approach named co-training is a very effective semisupervised approach, but it requires two views to be sufficient and independent, a condition that is difficult to meet in practical applications. To address this issue, we developed a semicorrelated co-training module to achieve the two-view condition. To mitigate the problem of limited labeled samples, both labeled and unlabeled samples are used as inputs for the semicorrelated co-training module. Benefiting from the self-sampling module and the semicorrelated co-training module, the experimental results based on different U. prolifera datasets from MODIS and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) show that the proposed model in the manuscript has contributed to the improvement of the detection accuracy of U.prolifera.

TI  - CNN-TransNet: A Hybrid CNN-Transformer Network With Differential Feature Enhancement for Cloud Detection
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Thin clouds detection and the difficulty in distinguishing between clouds and bright surface features have consistently presented challenges in optical remote sensing cloud detection tasks. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made significant progress, however, CNNs perform weakly in capturing global information interactions due to the inherent limitation of network structure. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid CNN-transformer network with differential feature enhancement (DFE) for cloud detection (CNN-TransNet). CNN-TransNet adopts a dual-branch encoder consisting of a CNN-transformer module and a DFE module. CNN-TransNet combines the strengths of both transformer and CNN to enhance finer details and build long-range dependencies. CNN is considered a high-resolution feature extractor for capturing low-level features. The transformer module encodes image sequences by patch embedding to extract high-level features and relationships. DFE branch utilizes differential features and attention mechanism to further obtain effective information for distinguishing between clouds and nonclouds. The decoder upsamples features of the encoder and concatenates multiscale features from the CNN layers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves excellent performance on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images, with a high cloud pixel precision of 92.94% and 93.04%. Moreover, it effectively reduces thin cloud omissions and the misclassifications of bright surface features.

TI  - A Priori Land Surface Reflectance Synergized With Multiscale Features Convolution Neural Network for MODIS Imagery Cloud Detection
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) images are widely used in land, ocean, and atmospheric monitoring, due to their wide spectral coverage, high temporal resolution, and convenient data acquisition. Accurate cloud detection is critical to the fine processing and application of MODIS images. Owing to spatial resolution limitations and the influence of mixed pixels, most MODIS cloud detection algorithms struggle to effectively recognize of clouds and ground objects. Here, we propose a novel cloud detection method based on land surface reflectance and a multiscale feature convolutional neural network to achieve high-precision cloud detection, particularly for thin clouds and clouds over bright surface. A monthly surface reflectance dataset was constructed by MODIS products (MOD09A1) and employed to provide background information for cloud detection. Difference-based samples were obtained using surface reflectance as well MODIS images of different phases based on difference operations. The multiscale feature network (MFCD-Net) using an atrous spatial pyramid pooling and a channel and spatial attention module integrated low-level spatial features and high-level semantic information to capture multiscale features and generate a high-precision cloud mask. For cloud detection experiments and quantitative analysis, 61 MODIS images acquired at different times on various underlying surface types were used. Cloud detection results were compared to those of UNet, Deeplabv3+, UNet++, PSPNet, and top of atmosphere-based (MFCD-TOA) methods. The proposed method performed well, with the highest overall accuracy (96.55%), precision (92.13%), and recall (88.90%). It improved cloud detection accuracy in various scenarios, reducing thin cloud omission and bright surface misidentification.

TI  - Land Use Classification of High-Resolution Multispectral Satellite Images With Fine-Grained Multiscale Networks and Superpixel Postprocessing
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use recognition from multispectral satellite images is fundamentally critical for geological applications, but the results are not satisfied. The scale dimension of current multiscale learning is too coarse to account for rich scales in multispectral images, and pixel-wise classification tends to produce "salt-and-pepper" labels due to possible misclassification in heterogeneous regions. In this article, these issues are addressed by proposing a new pixel-wise classification model with finer scales for convolutional neural networks. The model is designed to extract multiscale contextual information using multiscale networks at a fine-grained level, addressing the issue of insufficient multiscale learning for classification. Furthermore, a small-scale segmentation-combination method is introduced as a postprocessing solution to smooth fragmented classification results. The proposed method is tested on GF-1, GF-2, DEIMOS-2, GeoEye-1, and Sentinel-2 satellite images, and compared with six neural-network-based algorithms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in finding objects of large scale difference, improving classification accuracy, and reducing classified fragments. The discussion also illustrates that convolutional neural networks and pixel-wise inference are more practical than transformer and patch-wise recognition.

TI  - Detection of Coral Bleaching in Oceanic Islands Using Normalized Bottom Reflectance Change Index From Multispectral Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global climate change, detecting coral bleaching using high-resolution multispectral remote sensing images is essential. However, the difficulty in obtaining the bottom reflectance spectrum restricts the ability to capture changes in highly heterogeneous coral reefs. Furthermore, the coupling between bottom reflectance and water-column absorption affects inverting bottom reflectance. We propose a normalized bottom reflectance change index (NBRCI) based on time series of quantitatively and physically inverted bottom reflectance without ground data. We compare the results with coral bleaching temperature products to validate change processes. Experimental results from the Landsat-8 images of Kuria Island-Aranuka Atoll and French Frigate Shoals of Pacific Islands from 2013 to 2023 prove that the NBRCI can effectively characterize the degree of change in the bottom and identify the spatiotemporal distribution of coral bleaching and recovery. NBRCI is beneficial for monitoring the health of coral reef benthic habitats at the pixel level around the globe.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF AL-HILLAH RIVER POLLUTION AT BABIL GOVERNORATE (IRAQ)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE JOVAN CVIJIC SASA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the environmental characteristics of Al-Hillah River were studied using geoinformatics applications, which is one of the geospatial techniques (GST). Applying this methodology, a geographic information system was developed, and it was supplied with laboratory data for the physical and chemical properties of 16 parameters for 2021. These data were linked to their spatial locations, using radar imagery of the Digital Elevation Model (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission), and Landsat ETM+7 satellite image. The results indicated that Al-Hillah River was affected by the liquid discharges of factories, cities, and farms spread on its sides, especially in the cities of Sadat Al-Hindiya, Al-Hillah, and Al-Hashimiyah. The seasonal changes in the climate affected some characteristics, including water temperature, pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, and total hardness. The study showed that the concentration of sulfate (SO4) has risen above the permissible limits for the waters of Iraqi rivers. There are relatively high hardness and alkalinity values, but they were within the permissible limits. The study also showed that most of the results of environmental parameters that were used in the laboratory, were within the permissible limits of Iraqi water, except for sulfates. The justification for conducting this study is to help government agencies and decisionmakers to adopt a correct vision for development projects that serve Babil Governorate. Also, it is the first time that the environmental characteristics of Al-Hillah River are studied using geoinformatics applications.

AB  - The cultivation system, referred to in Colombia as the vegetable garden, is a place where a colossal diversity of food is cultivated, and intertwined thoughts, practices, languages, rhythms, times, as well as forms of social coexistence, established from a logic of their own. This article presents a systema-tization around the cultivation systems and is exemplified ethnographically with the particular case of the Andean orchards in Figueroa, department of Cauca. The focus of the following research is ethnographic, it is based on a careful review of theoretical and methodological contributions, mainly from disciplinary areas such as natural sciences and anthropology. It is identified that the production units are biodiverse spaces, which have been adapted based on orographic conditions, climates and cultural dynamics, although its name varies in each region, in many cases by virtue of the mother tongue of the communities that inhabit these territories, likewise, the techniques and knowledge used are objectified, with a kind of nuances in each geographical portion.

TI  - Hydrogeomorphic and Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Riverine Wetlands in the Interfluvial Zone of Ganga and Sai Rivers, Uttar Pradesh, India
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - An extensive riverine wetlands system, which includes two Ramsar sites, occurs in the interfluvial zone between the Ganga and Sai Rivers in the Gangetic plains. Channel avulsion has formed a system of sinuous channel wetlands and floodplain wetlands, such as oxbow lakes, meanders, complex scrolls, and the remnant of fluvial features that grew through erosional and depositional processes, resulting in riverine wetlands. These riverine wetlands are significant but endangered and threatened biodiversity hotspots. The study of spatial distribution and temporal change analysis of these riverine wetlands are very much necessary for assessment and management. Extraction, delineation and mapping of these riverine wetlands in the GIS environment using remote sensing data reveal that these riverine wetlands belong to an unstable fluvial system with low energy and high sediment yield. The spatio-temporal changes in the areal extent of these riverine wetlands have been assessed by an image-to-image change detection method based on spectral indices (NDVI and MNDWI) derived from satellite imagery from 2000 to 2019. The analysis showed that the floodplain wetlands are shrinking continuously, whereas the channel wetlands shrank up to 2014 and afterwards increased gradually due to rejuvenation activities; however, the overall trend is still decreasing with respect to the year 2000. Drought conditions prevail frequently, and extreme stress due to land use and land cover changes, along with the groundwater exploitation, will likely lead to continued declines in these unstable, low-energy riverine wetlands in the near future, which will ecologically and environmentally affect the interfluvial zone of the Ganga and Sai Rivers.

TI  - Early Stage Forest Fire Detection from Himawari-8 AHI Images Using a Modified MOD14 Algorithm Combined with Machine Learning
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The early detection and rapid extinguishing of forest fires are effective in reducing their spread. Based on the MODIS Thermal Anomaly (MOD14) algorithm, we propose an early stage fire detection method from low-spatial-resolution but high-temporal-resolution images, observed by the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the geostationary meteorological satellite Himawari-8. In order to not miss early stage forest fire pixels with low temperature, we omit the potential fire pixel detection from the MOD14 algorithm and parameterize four contextual conditions included in the MOD14 algorithm as features. The proposed method detects fire pixels from forest areas using a random forest classifier taking these contextual parameters, nine AHI band values, solar zenith angle, and five meteorological values as inputs. To evaluate the proposed method, we trained the random forest classifier using an early stage forest fire data set generated by a time-reversal approach with MOD14 products and time-series AHI images in Australia. The results demonstrate that the proposed method with all parameters can detect fire pixels with about 90% precision and recall, and that the contribution of contextual parameters is particularly significant in the random forest classifier. The proposed method is applicable to other geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite sensors, and it is expected to be used as an effective method for forest fire detection.

TI  - Using a Tandem Flight Configuration between Sentinel-6 and Jason-3 to Compare SAR and Conventional Altimeters in Sea Surface Signatures of Internal Solitary Waves
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry has been providing a continuous record of ocean measurements with numerous applications across the entire range of ocean sciences. A reference orbit has been used since 1992 with TOPEX/Poseidon, which was repeated in the Jason missions, and in the newly launched Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (in November 2020) to continually monitor the trends of sea level rise and other properties of the sea surface. These multidecadal missions have evolved alongside major technological advances, whose measurements are unified into a single data record owing to continuous intercalibration and validation efforts. However, the new Sentinel-6 provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing, which improves the along-track resolution of conventional altimeters from a few kilometres (e.g., for Jason-3) to about 300 m. This means a major leap in sampling towards higher frequencies of the ocean spectrum, which inevitably means reconciling the assumption of a uniform Brown surface between the footprints of the larger kilometre-scale conventional altimetry and those of the finer-scale SAR altimetry. To explore this issue, this study uses the vantage point of the Sentinel-6/Jason-3 tandem phase to compare simultaneous sea surface signatures of large-scale Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) between SAR and conventional altimetry. These waves can modulate the sea surface into arrayed sections of increased and decreased roughness with horizontal scales up to 10 km, which inflict sharp transitions between increased and decreased backscatter in the radar altimeters. It is found that Sentinel-6 can provide more detailed structures of ISWs in standard level-2 products, when compared with those from the conventional Jason-3 (similarly to previous results reported from the SAR altimeter from Sentinel-3). However, a new and striking feature is found when comparing the radar backscatter between Sentinel-6 and Jason-3, which are in opposite phases in the ISWs. These intriguing results are discussed in light of the intrinsically different acquisition geometries of SAR and conventional altimeters as well as possible implications thereof.

TI  - Experience of Semantic-Cognitive Modeling of Religious Worldview in Languages of Different Structure (HARAM Concept)
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The experience of reconstructing the religious (Islamic) concept as a value-cognitive and ide- ological constant is presented on the example of the concept HARAM/HIARAM in Russian and Avar linguistic cultures. The material for the study was data from lexicographic sources, paremiological funds of these languages, data from Russian and Avar texts (including trans- lations) of spiritual literature; language data of the National Corpuses of the Russian and Avar languages. It is noted that the conceptual component of the concept under study reveals similarities in the compared linguocultures: the HARAM semantic model is represented by an obligatory component with a negative connotation everything that is bad, evil, sin > forbidden' [certain actions, deeds, objects and phenomena], and an optional component with a positive connotation: reserved place, forbidden [for everything bad] territory'. It is clarified that the value component of the con- cept is wider than in terms of an ordinary pro- hibition or taboo. It is shown that in the Mus- lim consciousness HARAM is a multicom- ponent concept with ambivalent semantics. Similarities and differences in the objectifica- tion of this concept may depend, first of all, on the specifics of the religious and linguistic consciousness of a person, his worldview; secondly, they can be conditioned by the dis- course in which the concept is explicated, and hence the objectification takes place in dif- ferent worldview (religious, everyday, etc.). The process of desacralization of the concept HARAM semantics is considered.

M3  - Article
AB  - The cities in any developing countries are the main backbone for the economic growth of the country. In recent days, developing countries faces major issues such as increases in urbanisation and population. An assessment of built-up area plays an important role during the regional planning and infrastructure development of the city. Mysuru has a unique place in the world due to its culture, green cover, and pleasant weather. The present study assess the decade changes in a built-up area of Mysuru District, Karnataka State, India using multispectral remotely sensed data of 2009 and 2019. Change detection of an entire Mysuru District has been carried out with respect to the built-up area of cities and taluks. An experimental result shows that 4.66% of built-up cover in 2009 was increased to 6.56% in 2019. These results show that the built-up cover of the Mysuru district increased by 1.9% over the decade. Overall classification was estimated to be 88.7% for 2009 and 85.4% for 2019.

AB  - The rapid proliferation of non-cooperative spacecraft and space debris in orbit has precipitated a surging demand for on-orbit servicing and space debris removal at a scale that only autonomous missions can address, but the prerequisite autonomous navigation and flightpath planning to safely capture an unknown, non-cooperative, tumbling space object is an open problem. Planning safe, effective trajectories requires real-time, automated spacecraft feature recognition algorithms to pinpoint the locations of collision hazards (e.g., solar panels or antennas) and safe docking features (e.g., satellite bodies or thrusters). Prior work in this area reveals that computer vision models' performance is highly dependent on the training dataset and its coverage of scenarios visually similar to the real scenarios that occur in deployment. Hence, the algorithm may have degraded performance under certain lighting conditions even when the rendezvous maneuver conditions of the chaser to the target spacecraft are the same. This work delves into how humans perform these tasks through a survey of how people experienced with spacecraft shapes and components recognize features of the three spacecraft: Landsat, Envisat, Anik, and the orbiter Mir. The survey reveals that the most common patterns in the human detection process were to consider the shape and texture of the features-antenna, solar panels, thrusters, and satellite bodies. This work introduces a novel algorithm called SpaceYOLO, which uses context-based decision processes, specifically shape and texture information, to perform object detection. Unlike traditional object detectors, the method demands far fewer labor hours for synthetic data preparation. Performance in autonomous spacecraft detection of SpaceYOLO is compared to ordinary YOLOv5 in hardware-inthe-loop experiments under different lighting and chaser maneuver conditions at the ORION facility at Florida Tech.

TI  - Effect of Deforestation on Land Surface Temperature in the Chiquitania Region, Bolivia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Neotropical forests offer alternatives to surface cooling and their conservation is an effective solution for mitigating the effects of climate change. Little is known about the importance of tropical dry forests for temperature regulation in Chiquitania, a region with increasing deforestation rates. The impact that deforestation processes are having on the surface temperature in Chiquitania remains an open question. This study evaluated trends in forest cover loss based on land surface temperatures (degrees C) in forested and deforested areas in Chiquitania. We hypothesized a positive relationship between higher deforestation and a temperature increase, which would decrease the resilience of highly disturbed Chiquitano forests. We evaluated ten sampling sites (10 x 10 km), including five in forested areas with some type of protection and the other five in areas with populated centers and accelerated forest loss. We developed scripts on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform using information from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, MOD13A2) and the daytime and nighttime Land Surface Temperature (LST, MYD11A1) from MODIS products for the period 2001-2021. The statistical significance of the trends of the time series averages of the MODIS products was analyzed using a nonparametric Mann-Kendall test and the degree of the relationship between the variables was determined using the Pearson statistic. Our results based on NDVI analysis showed consistent vegetation growth in forested areas across the study period, while the opposite occurred in deforested lands. Regarding surface temperature trends, the results for daytime LST showed a positive increase in the four deforested areas. Comparatively, daytime LST averages in deforested areas were warmer than those in forested areas, with a difference of 3.1 degrees C. Additionally, correlation analyses showed a significant relationship between low NDVI values due to deforestation in three sites and an increase in daytime LST, while for nighttime LST this phenomenon was registered in two deforested areas. Our results suggest a significant relationship between the loss of forest cover and the increase in land surface temperature in Chiquitania. This study could be the first step in designing and implementing an early climate-forest monitoring system in this region.

TI  - Fusion of Satellite Images and Weather Data With Transformer Networks for Downy Mildew Disease Detection
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop diseases significantly affect the quantity and quality of agricultural production. In a context where the goal of precision agriculture is to minimize or even avoid the use of pesticides, weather and remote sensing data with deep learning can play a pivotal role in detecting crop diseases, allowing localized treatment of crops. However, combining heterogeneous data such as weather and images remains a hot topic and challenging task. Recent developments in transformer architectures have shown the possibility of fusion of data from different domains, such as text-image. The current trend is to custom only one transformer to create a multimodal fusion model. Conversely, we propose a new approach to realize data fusion using three transformers. In this paper, we first solved the missing satellite images problem, by interpolating them with a ConvLSTM model. Then, we proposed a multimodal fusion architecture that jointly learns to process visual and weather information. The architecture is built from three main components, a Vision Transformer and two transformer-encoders, allowing to fuse both image and weather modalities. The results of the proposed method are promising achieving an overall accuracy of 97%.

TI  - Inversion of a New Designed ANN-Based 3-D-RTM Emulator by Continuous MCMC Technique to Monitor Crop Biophysical Properties Using Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise monitoring of the crop growth is useful for agriculture management systems that allow to improve and sustain food security. Measuring the biophysical properties, such as leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll (Cab) content, is the key to properly following the growth cycle of crops. In this perspective, we propose an innovative approach for monitoring landscape-scale biophysical properties of wheat and barley field crops using Sentinel-2 time-series imagery based on accurate 3-D direct and inverse radiative transfer modeling. It relies on an original 3-D radiative transfer models (RTM) emulator architecture based on a residual artificial neural network (ResNet). We employed the well-known discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model to simulate Sentinel-2 images and generate a database that serves to train and validate the ResNet emulator. To do it, two realistic mockups, both composed of soil and 3-D wheat plants, are set up. The first mockup mimics the wheat and barley from their start of growth to their full growth, and the second reproduces the features of the wheat and barley plant when they turn yellowish and mature for harvesting. Besides, we extract the bare soil spectra signature from Sentinel-2 images acquired before sowing. Results of the proposed emulator show its similarity to DART simulation while it is much faster. These emulator features make it possible to adapt an inversion technique based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), specifically, as a novelty, a continuous MCMC. The latter exploits the emulator to perform the iterative sampling processing on all continuous values in allowed intervals according to each sought biophysical property until converging to its respective posterior distribution. The proposed scheme of RTM emulator inversion based on continuous MCMC and using Sentinel-2 imagery is called "REMI." It ensures high retrieval performances, which reach an RMSE equal to 0.06 and 0.1 for LAI and Cab, respectively.

TI  - The Testament of Spirits: Eschatological Spiritualism in Russia at the Turn of the 20th Century
T2  - NOVOE LITERATURNOE OBOZRENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spiritualists believed that spirits entered into communion with people to bring the final revelation. They identified the current moment with the beginning of the Age of the Holy Spirit. Like many other holders of an eschatological consciousness, spiritualist were fascinated by hermeneutic practices. Starting with the idea of the cultivation of revelation, they searched for ways to relate new revelations to biblical texts. The fundamental worldview of the spiritualists was a belief in invisible laws and the actions of other-worldly agents, which determine the course of events. Reflecting on the eschatological sense of history, spiritualists drew on oriental and national themes. In the historiosophical component of spiritualistic eschatologies, appeals to orientalist and nationalist themes can be found. The concept of the eschatological clash between the East and the West was used to interpret current political events. Spiritualist nationalism envisioned an expansion of the nation beyond the earthly realm. The spirits of those who, in spiritualist's view, embodied the Russian nation, were endowed with the power to intervene in the course of the events. Spiritualists waited for upheaval and catastrophes that were to rid world of impurity. At the same time, they believed in the coming total transformation of the world, which, however, would only be possible through the active participation of people in the eschatological process.

T2  - The Journal of clinical investigation
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the sentinel cells of the alveolar space, maintaining homeostasis, fending off pathogens, and controlling lung inflammation. During acute lung injury, AMs orchestrate the initiation and resolution of inflammation in order to ultimately restore homeostasis. This central role in acute lung inflammation makes AMs attractive targets for therapeutic interventions. Single-cell RNA-Seq and spatial omics approaches, together with methodological advances such as the generation of human macrophages from pluripotent stem cells, have increased understanding of the ontogeny, function, and plasticity of AMs during infectious and sterile lung inflammation, which could move the field closer to clinical application. However, proresolution phenotypes might conflict with proinflammatory and antibacterial responses. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of AMs at vulnerable time points over the course of infectious lung injury might harbor the risk of serious side effects, such as loss of antibacterial host defense capacity. Thus, the identification of key signaling hubs that determine functional fate decisions in AMs is of the utmost importance to harness their therapeutic potential.

TI  - THE COLLAPSE OF HEGEMONIAL NORMALITY: MIGRATION AND THE POLITICS OF MEMORY IN THE U.S., UK AND FRANCE
T2  - POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study deals with the transformation of memory politics in the USA, Great Britain and France, and has for purpose to analyze the nature of this transformation. The authors question the assumption that conflicts over a legitimate version of the past were caused by a "minority rebellion" (blacks in the case of the US, descendants of non-European migrants in the case of the UK and France). The article demonstrates that the request for a revision of the dominant narrative regarding the national past was formulated and articulated within civil society, and, accordingly, is not limited to the claims of minorities. The authors rely on an agonistic approach to collective memory, in which the latter is understood as the result of certain conventions emerging in the course of constantly renewed debates in society about one's own past. The presentation is focused on the analysis of public discussions around the content of school education, the set of official holidays and memorable dates, the appearance of urban spaces and expositions in museums in the three mentioned countries. The findings suggest that the watershed in commemorative conflicts runs not along the line of ethnic origin, but along the line of worldview. Behind the confrontation between different versions of historical memory, there is ultimately the clash of different "models" of the nation (more inclusive and less inclusive), and the very call for a revision of the dominant narrative rests on the issue of including previously excluded groups in the nation.

TI  - Landsat-Scale Regional Forest Canopy Height Mapping Using ICESat-2 Along-Track Heights: Case Study of Eastern Texas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne profiling lidar missions such as the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) are collecting direct elevation measurements, supporting the retrieval of vegetation attributes such as canopy height that are crucial in forest carbon and ecological studies. However, such profiling lidar systems collect observations along predefined ground tracks which limit the spatially complete mapping of forest canopy height. We demonstrate that the fusion of ICESat-2 along-track canopy height estimates and ancillary Landsat and LANDFIRE (Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools Project) data can enable the generation of spatially complete canopy height data at a regional level in the United States. We developed gradient-boosted regression models relating canopy heights with ancillary data values and used them to predict canopy height in unobserved locations at a 30 m spatial resolution. Model performance varied (R-2 = 0.44 - 0.50, MAE = 2.61-2.80 m) when individual (per month) Landsat data and LANDFIRE data were used. Improved performance was observed when combined Landsat and LANDFIRE data were used (R-2 = 0.69, MAE = 2.09 m). We produced a gridded canopy height product over our study area in eastern Texas, which agreed moderately (R-2 = 0.46, MAE = 4.38 m) with independent airborne lidar-derived canopy heights. Further, we conducted a comparative assessment with the Global Forest Canopy Height product, an existing 30 m spatial resolution canopy height product generated using GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) canopy height and multitemporal Landsat data. In general, our product showed better agreement with airborne lidar heights than the global dataset (R-2 = 0.19 MAE = 5.83 m). Major differences in canopy height values between the two products are attributed to land cover changes, height metrics used (98th in this study vs 95th percentile), and the inherent differences in lidar sampling and their geolocation uncertainties between ICESat-2 and GEDI. On the whole, our integration of ICESat-2 data with ancillary datasets was effective for spatially complete canopy height mapping. For better modeling performance, we recommend the careful selection of ICESat-2 datasets to remove erroneous data and applying a series of Landsat data to account for phenological changes. The canopy height product provides a valuable spatially detailed and synoptic view of canopy heights over the study area, which would support various forestry and ecological assessments at an enhanced 30 Landsat spatial resolution.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Algorithms for Rapeseed Fields Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Time Series: Temporal Transfer Scenario and Ground Sampling Constraints
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to enhance rapeseed field detection accuracy using Sentinel-1 (S1) time series data and addressing challenges in collecting ground samples. The proposed solutions include model transfer between years without retraining and secondly, developing models with limited training samples. The research evaluates the performance of Random Forest (RF) and three deep learning (DL) algorithms: Long Short-Term Memory Fully Convolutional Network (LSTM-FCN), InceptionTime, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). All four algorithms are evaluated initially with abundant ground samples and later with smaller sample sizes (100, 300, 500 and 1000 samples). Model transferability is tested across years. The impact of S1 image count on transfer accuracy is examined. Additionally, the effect of the phenological shift in the rapeseed growth cycle of 15 and 30 days between the training and test years was also investigated. The findings demonstrate strong model performance when training and testing occur in the same year (F1-score up to 95%). Within sample sizes of 300 to 1000, RF and InceptionTime stand out with high accuracy (F1-score>90%). When employing different years for training and testing with abundant sample sizes, all four algorithms correctly classified rapeseed (F1-score between 85.5% and 92.7%). In cases of a reduced number of images, the performance of InceptionTime and LSTM-FCN decreased (16% decrease in the F1-score), while RF and MLP maintain their performance. Notably, RF outperforms DL algorithms with an F1-score of 89.1%. In the context of a phenological shift, only InceptionTime and LSTM-FCN demonstrated strong performance (F1-score between 87.7% and 92.6%).

TI  - THE SHIBANID RULE IN SAMARKAND: LEGITIMATION, CULTURE AND MONUMENTAL ARCHITECTURE (1512-1578)
T2  - ZOLOTOORDYNSKOE OBOZRENIE-GOLDEN HORDE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Research objectives: The objective of this research is to analyze the culture and monumental architecture of Samarkand during the reign of the Shibanids, and to identi-fy the origins of cultural traditions in architectural construction in Samarkand between 1512-1578. Research materials: The study mainly uses historical works by Central Asian, Persian, and Turkic authors from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, such as Khwandamir, Zayn ad-din Vasifi, Abdallah Nasrallahi, Mirza Muhammad Haydar, Nisari, Hafiz Tanysh Bukhari, Raqimi, as well as archive materials of L. Mankovskaya and M. Masson from the Central State Archive of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Additionally, publications of Russian, Soviet, and post-Soviet specialists on the history of Central Asia, including V. Bartold, A. Semenov, R. Mukminova, B. Akhmedov, R. McChesney, T. Sultanov, K. Baypakov, E. Smagulov, D. DeWeese, F. Schwartz, A. Muminov, K. Kattaev, B. Babajanov, V. Norik, etc. are also analyzed in detail. Results and novelty of the research: The Shibanids Kuchkunji Khan, Suyunchkhoja Khan, and their descendants combined Jochid and Timurid roots in their genealogy and used this to legitimize their rule. The political system of the state, characterized by strong regionalism in which Samarkand stood out, influenced the formation of local cultural iden-tity, which was reflected in the monumental architecture in Samarkand. This architecture shows a synthesis of cultural traditions from the Syr Darya regions of Ulus Jochi and Khorezm and the Timurid heritage of Maverannahr. During the 16th century in Samarkand, three memorial places with different architectural styles and geographical locations were built, where representatives of the Shibanid dynasty were buried. Each of them reflected different ideological lines, followed by certain representatives of the Shibanids. According to the author, the Shibanids-Kuchkunjids built a madrasah in Samarkand that continued certain Timurid traditions, while simultaneously incorporating elements of Golden Horde architecture. The construction of the madrasah of Abu Said Khan in the historical centre of Samarkand, near the madrasah of Mirzo Ulugbek, had symbolic meaning. The first Shibanids supported the use of the Turkic language in Maverannahr due to both Timurid traditions and the Golden Horde heritage, in which the Turkic literary language occupied a significant place.

TI  - THE LANGUAGE OF CULTURAL SYMBOLISM IN THE MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE OF DANCE
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The symbolism of dance is one of the ancient means of encoding cultural meanings. In the course of its development, it was a kind of a meeting place for mathematical means and metaphysical meanings realized in the philosophy of culture. This article touches upon an important feature of the formation of systems of cultural symbols, in particular, the constitutive penetration of mathematical rules into them. This regularity is traced on the example of the semantic intersection of the mythological cosmogony of eternal return with the mathematical structures of the theory of symmetry. The article considers one of the most famous ritual dances and its space as a valid token of some mathematical and metaphysical signs and a meeting place for the latter. The spatio-temporal model of a dance piece built on the basis of group-theoretic formalism reveals the metaphysical meaning of the given movement, whose periodicity allows us to introduce temporal symmetries and identify them with the spatial symmetries of geometric patterns. By comparing the symmetry groups of static ornament and dynamic dance, within the framework of the mythopoetic plan for designing our existence, the properties of the dance piece chosen as a token are revealed. This article discusses not only metaphysical, but also mathematical connections between the labyrinth (artifact), meander (abstract ornament) and dance (the phenomenon of musical arts). This becomes possible on the basis of the establishment of the rationalization of the meanings born in the mythological worldview as one of the ways of formation a philosophical consciousness. The central figure of the study is Dionysus, the subject is the rationalization of the meanings of the mythopoetic space, the method is one of the applications of group theory: the theory of symmetry. The article links the semantics of the labyrinth, the elements of the selected dance research and search operations, including the interpretation of the latest semantics in the actual research. The conclusion that can be drawn from checking the "symbolic totality" of dance is that its mathematical formalism is loaded with meaning in the same way that the mathematical equations of physics are loaded with interpretation, i.e. ontological meanings. Thus, it follows that this precedent is the revelation of the methodological substantiation of the use of a natural scientific instrument for the analysis of a set of symbolic structures.

TI  - What Does the Worldview of Russian Students Look Like and How Does It Change? Thematic Modeling of Artistic Literature Texts
T2  - MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper scrutinizes the portrayal and transformation of the worldview of Russian students as reflected in the literary canon. It identifies how significant issues of student life, as interpreted by contemporaries and encapsulated in texts, highlight students' societal position, their social functions, and their contemporary values and societal expectations.By engaging with present social circumstances and casting students as central characters, literature captures the principal social characteristics of youth over past decades. This provides insights into the lifestyle and societal roles of this demographic group, i.e., information that is otherwise unavailable due to the lack of retrospective sociological data.The study utilized probabilistic topic modeling to analyze texts by Russian-speaking authors from the late 19th to the early 21st centuries (Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Garin-Mikhailovsky, Kuprin, Veresaev, Kaverin, Trifonov, Osipov, Polyakov, Ivanov, the collection of Desna, Solomatina and Sanaev). The selection criteria were genre, publication date, language, and plot.The examination of the selected texts facilitated the tracking of the portrayal of student youth within social contexts. It uncovered fluctuating and stable aspects of the student worldview over time. The worldview was analyzed as a multifaceted picture, with central characters, temporal and spatial backdrops, and a range of emotions, philosophies, values, and evaluations.The study's methodological framework is based on Husserl's concept of intersubjectivity and Blumer's symbolic interactionism. It identified the distinct intersubjective features of student worldviews from different historical periods: the pre-revolutionary period where social status and university interactions assured future prosperity; the era of Soviet students for whom the university was a place of creativity and personal development; late Soviet students who saw the university as a scientific interactive environment; and post-Soviet students who viewed the university as a sphere fostering social connections.The study yielded compelling data on symbolism related to color, language, everyday objects, social surroundings, and notable individuals or fictional characters significant to students. It also observed the high variability of speech symbols relating to family and friendly relationships, moods, environmental spaces, and evaluative and value judgments.The paper concludes by underlining the pivotal role of informal university interactions in shaping a student's worldview.

TI  - Ionospheric Phase Delay Correction for Time Series Multiple-Aperture InSAR Constrained by Polynomial Deformation Model
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a supplement to time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR), time-series multiple-aperture InSAR (TS-MAI) can measure the spatiotemporal changes in SAR along-track surface deformation. TS-MAI is often applied with low-frequency SAR data (e.g., L-band data) due to its ability to retain high interferometric coherence. However, the low-frequency SAR signal is vulnerable to ionospheric delays, which can significantly degrade the measurement accuracy of TS-MAI. This letter presents an approach to correct the ionospheric errors in TS-MAI. A polynomial cubic model is employed to constrain the ground deformation, which is then incorporated into the observation model for effectively separating the deformation signal and the ionospheric delays. The proposed method is tested using the L-band ALOS-1 PALSAR-1 datasets covering the Tocopilla area in Chile between November 2007 and March 2011. The correction performance and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparing the range split-spectrum interferometry (RSSI)-based method and the local GPS data, respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) improvement rates between TS-MAI and GPS are 72.17% for the SRGD site and 84.51% for the VLZL site, and their correlation coefficients increase from 0.23 and 0.50 to 0.52 and 0.61 after the correction.

TI  - Time Series InSAR Ionospheric Delay Estimation, Correction, and Ground Deformation Monitoring With Reformulating Range Split-Spectrum Interferometry
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ionospheric phase delay is a critical error source in time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR) for the purpose of monitoring ground surface deformation with SAR data obtained from low-frequency radar systems. Recently, the range split-spectrum interferometry (RSSI) method has been employed to estimate and rectify ionospheric errors in TS-InSAR. However, the performance of the RSSI method is largely restricted by the significant linear scale factors resulting from the current small SAR bandwidth. In this study, we propose a reformulating RSSI (Re-RSSI)-based method for correcting the ionospheric error in TS-InSAR by optimizing the linear scale factors, with the aim of improving the accuracy of TS-InSAR measurements. We evaluate the Re-RSSI method using 121 ALOS-1 PALSAR images that cover two distinct regions: the low-latitude Lazufre volcano region and the high-latitude Anaktuvuk River tundra fire region. Our results demonstrate that the Re-RSSI method can effectively remove time series ionospheric errors at both test sites, where we detected ionospheric delays of approximately 2.5 cm/year (yr) and 2.0 cm/yr, respectively. Using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements as ground truth, we achieved an 86.59% improvement rate in the root-mean-square error (RMSE) with the Re-RSSI method, which is significantly higher than the 66.40% improvement rate achieved with the traditional RSSI method.

TI  - DirecTES: A Direct Method for Land and Sea Surface Temperature and Emissivity Separation for Thermal Infrared Sensors-Application to TRISHNA and ECOSTRESS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coming years will see the launch of several missions (TRISHNA, LSTM, SBG), which will acquire images in four or more spectral bands in thermal infrared (TIR) at high spatial resolution (similar to 50-60 m) and with high temporal revisit (similar to 2-3 days). The derivation of surface temperature and emissivity values from top-of-atmosphere radiances is not straightforward, as it is a non-deterministic process requiring additional information. In this paper, we propose the algorithm DirecTES to efficiently separate surface temperature and emissivity. This algorithm is based on the use of a comprehensive spectral database of emissivity, resulting in a well-posed deterministic problem while not assuming strong hypotheses. The algorithm can also benefit from non-TIR information, such as the acquisitions from the same satellite but in the visible and near-infrared domains, or exogenous data-land/sea mask or soil-occupation map. These would help identify the nature of the surface and therefore improve the temperature and emissivity retrievals. After the complete description of the method, we evaluate the performances of DirecTES on theoretical landscapes in TRISHNA's context under a large range of atmospheric conditions. The retrievals of surface temperature reach RMSEs of 0.8 K over vegetation and 0.5 K over water, including both sensor and atmospheric uncertainties. We then evaluate DirecTES on ECOSTRESS images on sites where the ECOSTRESS Land Surface Temperature (LST) performance has been documented; DirecTES surface temperature retrievals are consistent with the ECOSTRESS LST product and the in-situ data.

TI  - Assessing the Agronomic Subfield Variability by Sentinel-2 NDVI Time-Series and Landscape Position
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimizing crop yield is one of the main focuses of precision farming. Variability in crop within a field can be influenced by many factors and it is necessary to better understand their interrelationships before precision management methods can be successfully used to optimize yield and quality. In this study, NDVI time-series from Sentinel-2 imagery and the effects of landscape position, topographic features, and weather conditions on agronomic spatial variability of crop yields and yield quality were analyzed. Landscape position allowed the identification of three areas with different topographic characteristics. Subfield A performed the best in terms of grain yield, with a mean yield value 10% higher than subfield B and 35% higher than subfield C, and the protein content was significantly higher in area A. The NDVI derived from the Sentinel-2 data confirms the higher values of area A, compared to subfields B and C, and provides useful information about the lower NDVI cluster in the marginal areas of the field that are more exposed to water flow in the spring season and drought stress in the summer season. Landscape position analysis and Sentinel-2 data can be used to identify high, medium, and low NDVI values differentiated for each subfield area and associated with specific agronomic traits. In a climate change scenario, NDVI time-series and landscape position can improve the agronomic management of the fields.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Patient safety (PS) and quality improvement (QI) have gained momentum over the last decade and are becoming more integrated into medical training, physician reimbursement, maintenance of certification, and practice improvement initiatives. While PS and QI are often lumped together, they differ in that PS is focused on preventing adverse events while QI is focused on continuous improvements to improve outcomes. The pillars of health care as defined by the 1999 Institute of Medicine report "To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System" are safety, timeliness, effectiveness, efficiency, equity, and patient-centered care. Implementing a safety culture is dependent on all levels of the health care system. Part 1 of this CME will provide dermatologists with an overview of how PS fits into our current health care system and will include a focus on basic QI/PS terminology, principles, and processes. This article also outlines systems for the reporting of medical errors and sentinel events and the steps involved in a root cause analysis.

AB  - Anopheles mosquitoes are the vectors of human malaria, a disease responsible for a significant burden of global disease and over half a million deaths in 2020. Here, methods using a time series of cost-free Earth Observation (EO) data, 45,844 in situ mosquito monitoring captures, and the cloud processing platform Google Earth Engine are developed to identify the biogeographical variables driving the abundance and distribution of three malaria vectors-Anopheles gambiae s.l., An. funestus, and An. paludis-in two highly endemic areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. EO-derived topographical and time series land surface temperature and rainfall data sets are analysed using Random Forests (RFs) to identify their relative importance in relation to the abundance of the three mosquito species, and they show how spatial and temporal distributions vary by site, by mosquito species, and by month. The observed relationships differed between species and study areas, with the overall number of biogeographical variables identified as important in relation to species abundance, being 30 for An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus and 26 for An. paludis. Results indicate rainfall and land surface temperature to consistently be the variables of highest importance, with higher rainfall resulting in greater mosquito abundance through the creation of pools acting as mosquito larval habitats; however, proportional coverage of forest and grassland, as well as proximity to forests, are also consistently identified as important. Predictive application of the RF models generated monthly abundance maps for each species, identifying both spatial and temporal hot-spots of high abundance and, by proxy, increased malaria infection risk. Results indicate greater temporal variability in An. gambiae s.l. and An. paludis abundances in response to seasonal rainfall, whereas An. funestus is generally more temporally stable, with maximum predicted abundances of 122 for An. gambiae s.l., 283 for An. funestus, and 120 for An. paludis. Model validation produced R-2 values of 0.717 for An. gambiae s.l., 0.861 for An. funestus, and 0.448 for An. paludis. Monthly abundance values were extracted for 248,089 individual buildings, demonstrating how species abundance, and therefore biting pressure, varies spatially and seasonally on a building-to-building basis. These methods advance previous broader regional mosquito mapping and can provide a crucial tool for designing bespoke control programs and for improving the targeting of resource-constrained disease control activities to reduce malaria transmission and subsequent mortality in endemic regions, in line with the WHO's 'High Burden to High Impact' initiative. The developed method was designed to be widely applicable to other areas, where suitable in situ mosquito monitoring data are available. Training materials were also made freely available in multiple languages, enabling wider uptake and implementation of the methods by users without requiring prior expertise in EO.

TI  - Agronomic performance and remote sensing assessment of organic and mineral fertilization in rice fields.
T2  - Frontiers in plant science
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction: Rice heavily relies on nitrogen fertilizers, posing environmental, resource, and geopolitical challenges. This study explores sustainable alternatives like animal manure and remote sensing for resource-efficient rice cultivation. It aims to assess the long-term impact of organic fertilization and remote sensing monitoring on agronomic traits, yield, and nutrition.Methods: A six-year experiment in rice fields evaluated fertilization strategies, including pig slurry (PS) and chicken manure (CM) with mineral fertilizers (MIN), MIN-only, and zero-fertilization. Traits, yield, spectral responses, and nutrient content were measured. Sentinel-2 remote sensing tracked crop development.Results: Cost-effective organic fertilizers (PS and CM) caused a 13% and 15% yield reduction but still doubled zero-fertilization yield. PS reduced nitrogen leaching. Heavy metals in rice grains were present at safe amounts. Organic-fertilized crops showed nitrogen deficiency at the late vegetative stages, affecting yield. Sentinel-2 detected nutrient deficiencies through NDVI.Discussion: Organic fertilizers, especially PS, reduce nitrogen loss, benefiting the environment. However, they come with yield trade-offs and nutrient management challenges that can be managed and balanced with reduced additional mineral applications. Sentinel-2 remote sensing helps manage nutrient deficiencies. In summary, this research favors cost-effective organic fertilizers with improved nutrient management for sustainable rice production.

TI  - Gross primary production (GPP) changes of natural vegetation in the Comunidad Valenciana
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - This work analyzes the vegetation changes in the Comunidad Valenciana observed during the period 2001-2018, using the daily GPP (Gross Primary Production) time series at 1-km spatial resolution derived from Earth observation-based (EO) data. The GPP time series have been obtained from EO-based data (e.g., MODIS/ Terra-Aqua and SEVIRI/MSG) and meteorological (e.g., precipitation and temperature) data using the light use efficiency model proposed by Monteith. The carbon fluxes detection has been performed by means of a multi -resolution analysis (MRA) based on the wavelet transform (WT). This analysis allows to decomposing the signal into different temporal resolution components. The interanual trend determines the vegetation change, positive (greening) or negative (browning) of vegetation photosynthetic activity over long-term scales. The negative long-term changes observed in natural vegetation reveal the presence of areas characterized by high degradated conditions. This is the case of Natural Pack of 'Serra d' Espada' in Castellon province, which is also controlled by a local ecosystem conservation program. To identify more precisely these areas, the areas affected by abrupt changes (associated to forest fires) in which vegetation has not been yet recovered have been removed. In this case, the results show a good agreement with the official burnt areas from the local government.

T2  - Historia Natural (Corrientes)
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tuatara or Sphenodon punctatus is an endemic lepidosaur of New Zealand and the only extant representative of the rhynchocephalian clade. This reptile has attracted the attention of the human being since the first contacts; initially, with the Maoris, being an important creature present in their worldview, and later, for the first Europeans who arrived in New Zealand, during the English expeditions to the Pacific, standing out to the naturalists. Some specimens of the Tuatara were taken to England, and deposited in two institutions: at the Museum of the College of Surgeons, and at the British Museum, with little or no data of collection as was common at the time. In this context, the Tuatara was described three times receiving three names at the genus level, and curiously the same example was described twice. These names were Sphenodon Gray 1831, Hatteria Gray 1842, and Rhynchocephalus Owen 1845. In addition, it shared two of its names with other animals. Thus, the case of the Tuatara is one among many where there were cases of synonymy and homonymy within the history of zoological taxonomy.

TI  - Kang Youwei, Buddhism and Catholicism
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article offers an interpretation of the religious worldview of Kang Youwei (1858-1927). The basis of his views was Confucianism, with the ritual model of religiosity inherent in this doctrine; Kang Youwei also studied several areas of Buddhism from a philosophical point of view. In the treatise The Travelogue of Italy (1904), Kang Youwei offered an analysis of contemporary Catholicism from the standpoint of traditional Chinese literature, considered mainly from a political point of view. The Chinese thinker adhered to axiological relativism, from the position of which he perceived as equivalent any doctrines aimed at the self-improvement of the human person and the entire human society, although he did not approve of ascetic practices. Kang Youwei himself also claimed to be the founder of the dogma, although he was indifferent to ritual, and his system had an expressly philosophical pattern. The Kang's key concept was Tao, which was revealed to the maximum extent to Buddha and Confucius. Kang Youwei considered the teachings of Mohism, Taoism and early Christianity to be approximately equivalent, and he considered the Catholic Church and the Papacy as a cast from the socio-political system of Ancient Rome, which were particular implementations of the Tao in specific cultures and historical settings. Kang Youwei argued that the most important provisions of the teachings of Pythagoreanism, Judaism and early Christianity were of Indian origin, introduced by Buddhist preachers after the conquests of Alexander the Great.

T2  - ACQUE SOTTERRANEE-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF GROUNDWATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the rapid population increase in the Middle Seybouse sub-catchment area in North-East Algeria, the intense agricultural practices, and the industrial development, precious water resources proven to be significantly challenged in their sustainable exploitation both in terms of quantity and quality. The aim of this study is to identify the most suitable areas for groundwater recharge in the Middle Seybouse sub-catchment, over about 770.91 km2, using remote sensing data and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Six factors are recognized to positively affect groundwater recharge: rainfall, land cover, topography, drainage density, lineament density, and lithology. According to their level of involvement in the recharge process, these parameters have been reclassified and then evaluated using the multi-criteria analysis known as "Analytical Hierarchy Process" (AHP). A potential recharge map of the study area was produced showing that 60% of this area, located in the southern and central parts of the catchment, has a high to very high potential. ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve is used to validate the resulting groundwater potential recharge map using the existing wells in the study area.

TI  - Monitoring Urban Expansion by Coupling Multi-Temporal Active Remote Sensing and Landscape Analysis: Changes in the Metropolitan Area of Cordoba (Argentina) from 2010 to 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncontrolled and unsustainable urban sprawl are altering the Earth's surface at unprecedented rates. This research explores the potential of active remote sensors for mapping urban areas, for monitoring urban expansion processes and for depicting landscape pattern dynamics in a metropolis of South America. Based on multi-temporal urban cover maps of Cordoba, Argentina, purposely derived from COSMO-SkyMed SAR data by urban extraction algorithms, we quantified urban surface increase and described urbanization processes that occurred during 2010-2021 in sectors with different degrees of soil sealing. We extracted urban extent in four time-steps using an Urban EXTent extraction (UEXT) algorithm and quantified urban expansion, identifying newly built areas on 2.5 ha cells. For these cells, we computed urban cover and a set of landscape pattern indices (PIs), and by projecting them in a composition vs. configuration Cartesian space we performed a trajectory analysis. SAR-based urban extraction and cover change proved to be very accurate. Overall accuracy and Cohen's Kappa statistic evidenced very high values, always above 91.58% and 0.82, respectively, for urban extraction, and also above 90.50% and 0.72 concerning the accuracy of urban expansion. Cordoba's urban surface significantly increased (approximate to 900 ha in 10 years) following three main spatial processes in different city sectors (e.g., edge-expansion and outlying on peri-urban areas, and infill inside the ring road), which may have contrasting effects on the sustainability of the metropolitan area. Trajectory analysis highlighted non-linear relations between the urban cover and the PIs. Areas with very low and low urban intensity underwent a steep rise of both urban cover and PI values (e.g., urban patch dimension, complexity and number), depicting urban edge-expansion and outlying processes. In the areas with medium and high urban intensity the increase in patch dimension, along with the decrease in patch number and complexity, evidence the coalescence of urban areas that incorporate in the urban fabric the remnants of non-built up zones and fill the few residual green spaces. The proposed SAR mapping procedure coupled with landscape analysis proved to be useful to detect and depict different moments of urban expansion and, pending more tests on other cities and geographical conditions, it could be postulated among the RS indicators to monitor the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations.

TI  - Assessment of land use land cover dynamics and its contributing factors in Adama district, central Ethiopia
T2  - EQA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover change has resulted negative consequences for the quality of environment and life of rural livelihoods in Ethiopia in general and the study area in particular. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial and temporal Land Use/Land Cover Changes and its contributing factors in Adama District, Oromia regional sate, central Ethiopia. The three periods of satellite imageries (Landsat 4-5TM 1990, Landsat7 ETM+ 2000 and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS 2020) were used to detect the changes. By using simple random sampling technique, 240 respondents were selected, and questionnaires, interviews and field observations were used to collect the data. The collected data were analyzed by using ArcGIS 10.5; ERDAS imagine 2015, SPSS version 23 and excels 2010 software. The determinants variables of land use land cover changes were assessed using multiple regression model. The results showed that there was continuous expansion of cultivated land and settlement area, which increased by the rate of 935.3 and 797.1 hectares per year respectively during the study period of 1990 to 2020. On the other hand, water bodies, forest and shrub land reduced with rate of (-112.03), (-870.2), (-759) hectares per year respectively. This indicates that an increased deforestation together with poor land management practices has accelerated land cover changes. Rapid urbanization, settlement expansion and population growth, expansion of agricultural land, need for fuel wood and construction materials are the main driving forces to the land use /cover dynamics in the district. This suggest that there is a need to protect the fragile environment by implementing sustainable land management practice through integrated participatory approach. Besides, long and short term training need to be arranged for all farmers/stakeholders toward land use land cover changes of the district.

TI  - Toward improved urban flood detection using Sentinel-1: dependence of the ratio of post- to preflood double scattering cross sections on building orientation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are now commonly used for flood detection. Automated detection tends to be limited to rural areas owing to the complicated backscattering mechanisms occurring in urban areas. Flooding can be identified in urban areas by searching for increased SAR backscatter in a postflood image due to double scattering between water and adjacent buildings, compared with a preflood image where double scattering is between unflooded ground and buildings. For co-polarized data, if f is the angle between the building wall and the satellite direction of travel, double scattering is strongest for f = 0 deg and falls off as f increases. Theoretical studies estimating the ratio of flooded-to-unflooded double scatterer (DS) radar cross section (RCS) using X-band SAR data, found that the ratio was high at f = 0 deg but only small at f > 10 deg. Ostensibly, this implies that few DSs might be detected in an urban area. However, experiments on real images have called into question the veracity of the modeling. We describe an empirical study to examine the relationship between the flooded-to-unflooded DS RCS ratio and f in Sentinel-1 (S-1) C-band data. We use high-resolution light detection and ranging and aerial photographs so that f can be measured accurately and is based on S-1 images from flood events that occurred in the United Kingdom during the storms of winter 2019 to 2020. Results indicate that vertical-vertical polarization is better than vertical-horizontal at distinguishing flooded from unflooded DS; that the theoretical model used underestimates the number of DS with high RCS ratios in the f range 10 deg to 30 deg; and that sufficient DS ground heights can be determined to estimate an accurate local average flood level, although in high density housing there are less of these due to the presence of adjacent buildings.

TI  - Object-Based Informal Settlement Mapping in Google Earth Engine Using the Integration of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope Satellite Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping informal settlements' diverse morphological patterns remains intricate due to the unavailability and huge costs of high-resolution data, as well as the spatial heterogeneity of urban environments. The accessibility to high-spatial-resolution PlanetScope imagery, coupled with the convenience of simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC) algorithm within the Google Earth Engine (GEE), presents the potential for Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) to map the spatial morphology of deprivation pockets in a complex built-up environment of Durban. Such advances in multi-sensor satellite image inventories on GEE also afford the possibility to integrate data from sensors with different spectral characteristics and spatial resolutions for effective abstraction of informal settlement diversity. The main objective is to exploit Sentinel-1 radar data, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope optical data fusion for more accurate and precise localization of informal settlements using GEOBIA, within GEE. The findings reveal that the Random Forests classification model achieved informal settlement identification accuracy of 87% (F-score) and overall accuracy of 96%. An assessment of agreement between observed informal settlement extents and ground truth dimensions was conducted through regression analysis, yielding root mean square log error (RMSLE) = 0.69 and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) = 0.28. The results demonstrate reliability of the classification model in capturing variability of spatial characteristics of informal settlements. The research findings confirm efficacy of combined advantages of GEOBIA within GEE, and integrated datasets for more precise capturing of characteristic morphologic informal settlement features. The outcomes suggest a shift from standard static conventional approaches towards more dynamic, on-demand informal settlement mapping through cloud computing, a powerful analysis platform that simplifies access to and the processing of voluminous data. The study has important implications for identifying the most effective ways to map informal settlements in a complex urban landscape, thus providing a benchmark for other regions with significant landscape heterogeneity.

TI  - Billion Tree Tsunami Forests Classification Using Image Fusion Technique and Random Forest Classifier Applied to Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Images: A Case Study of Garhi Chandan Pakistan
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to address the challenges of global warming, the Billion Tree plantation drive was initiated by the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, in 2014. The land cover changes as a result of Billion Tree Tsunami project are relatively unexplored. In particular, the utilization of remote sensing techniques and satellite image classification has not yet been done. Recently, the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite has found much utilization in remote sensing and land cover classification. Sentinel-2 (S2) sensors provide freely available images with a spatial resolution of 10, 20 and 60 m. The higher classification accuracy is directly dependent on the higher spatial resolution of the images. This research aims to classify the land cover changes as a result of the Billion Tree plantation drive in the areas of our interest using Random Forest Classifier (RFA) and image fusion techniques applied to Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite images. A state-of-the-art, model-based image-sharpening technique was used to sharpen the lower resolution Sentinel-2 bands to 10 m. Then the RFA classifier was used to classify the sharpened images and an accuracy assessment was performed for the classified images of the years 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022. Finally, ground data samples were collected using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) drone and the classified image samples were compared with the real data collected for the year 2022. The real data ground samples were matched by more than 90% with the classified image samples. The overall classification accuracies [%] for the classified images were recorded as 92.87%, 90.79%, 90.27% and 93.02% for the sample data of the years 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022, respectively. Similarly, an overall Kappa hat classification was calculated as 0.87, 0.86, 0.83 and 0.84 for the sample data of the years 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022, respectively.

T2  - ECOLOGY OF HIMALAYAN TREELINE ECOTONE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Canopy height is a key physiognomic parameter of biodiversity, productivity and other ecosystem functions in high-elevation alpine ecosystems. However, little is known as to how altitude influences canopy height in these ecosystems. This study makes use of an open-access global forest canopy height map with a spatial resolution of 30 m that integrates Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data (April October 2019) and Landsat analysis -ready time-series data (year 2019). The variation in canopy height was quantified for each 100 m elevation band starting 500 metres below the alpine treeline ecotone at 3780 masl and extending up to 500 m above the alpine treeline ecotone. The global forest height map was compared to the in situ data (root-mean-square error [RMSE] = 6.6 m; mean absolute error [MAE] = 4.45 m). We observed a strong negative correlation (R-2 = 0.96) between altitude and LiDAR-estimated canopy height. The altitude alone explained 96% of the variation in canopy height (p < 0.001). This chapter provides the first of its kind landscape-level quantification of the rate at which canopy height decreases with the increase in altitudinal gradient across the Indian Himalayan treeline.

AB  - Influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) case recruitment tools from 10 countries were reviewed. The contents of the existing tools were compared against World Health Organization's current guidelines, and we also assessed the content validity (accuracy, completeness and consistency). Five of the ILI tools and two of the SARI tools were rated as having high accuracy against WHO case definitions. ILI completeness ranged from 25% to 86% and SARI from 52% to 96%. Average internal consistency scores were 86% for ILI and 94% for SARI. Limitations in the content validity of influenza case recruitment tools may compromise recruitment of eligible cases and result in varying detection rates across countries.

TI  - Temporal analysis of the NDVI of the Purrumpampa wetland in Huamachuco and its relationship with urban expansion
T2  - REVISTA GEOGRAFICA DE AMERICA CENTRAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion generally implies the informal occupation of vulnerable natural spaces, which leads to the deterioration of these ecosystems. This same phenomenon occurs in the Purrumpama wetland, located in Huamachuco, a city in the Sierra Libertad of Peru. For this reason, the objective of this article was to carry out a temporal analysis of the flora present in the wetland, contrasting the results obtained with a temporal analysis in Google Earth and identifying the relationship with urban expansion. For this purpose, Landsat 8 and Google Earth satellite images were used, delim-iting the study area as established by the plans of the Sanchez Carrion Provincial Municipality. In this way, it will continue that there is a constant decrease in vegetation cover in the South and South-East areas of the wetland, calculating a loss of 74,792 m2 of the wetland from 2012 to 2021. Likewise, it was argued that the ambivalent actions of the municipality has legitimized the occupa-tion of houses and control actions have been ineffective.

TI  - Synanthropic and Wild Animals as Sentinels of Zoonotic Agents: A Study of Leptospira Genotypes Circulating in Northeastern Italy.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Leptospirosis is an infectious disease widely reported in veterinary practice and a worldwide zoonosis. In Northeastern Italy, different serogroups and genotypes of Leptospira have been described in ill dogs, the most commonly detected being Icterohaemorragiae (ICT) ST 17, Australis (AUS) ST 24 and ST 198, Pomona (POM) ST 117 and ST 289, and Sejroe (SEJ) ST 155. However, there is little information available on the environmental exposure to Leptospira of wild and synanthropic animals. The aim of this study was to identify the circulating genotypes in potential reservoirs to fill this gap of knowledge. Between 2015 and 2022, 681 animal carcasses collected by the Public Veterinary Service were analyzed for Leptospira with a real-time PCR-based screening test, while positive samples were genotyped by multi-locus sequence typing analysis. To carry out our study, we tested 330 hedgehogs, 105 red foxes, 108 Norway rats, 79 mice, 22 coypus, 10 bank voles, 13 grey wolves, 5 common shrews and 9 greater mouse-eared bats. Five sequence types (STs) common in dogs were also found in wild animals: ST 24, ST 198, ST 17 and ST 155 in hedgehogs, ST 17 and ST 24 in foxes, ST 17 in rats, ST 17 and ST 155 in mice, and ST 117 in a wolf. In addition, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first Italian report of SEJ ST 197 in a bank vole. Furthermore, this study described a previous survey conducted in 2009 on coypus (30 animals from the province of Trento and 41 from the province of Padua), referring to a serological positivity (L. Bratislava) without any molecular detection of Leptospira. This study on Leptospira in synanthropic and wild animals highlighted the importance of increasing our epidemiological knowledge of leptospirosis and its zoonotic risks.

TI  - HIV burden and the global fast-track targets progress among pregnant women in Tanzania calls for intensified case finding: Analysis of 2020 antenatal clinics HIV sentinel site surveillance.
T2  - PloS one
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: For successful HIV response, updated information on the burden and progress toward HIV elimination targets are required to guide programmatic interventions. We used data from the 2020 HIV sentinel surveillance to update on the burden and factors associated with HIV infection, HIV status awareness, and ART coverage among pregnant women in Tanzania mainland.METHODOLOGY: We conducted the surveillance in 159 antenatal clinics (ANC) from all 26 regions of Tanzania's mainland from September to December 2020. This cross-sectional study included all pregnant women (≥15 years) on their first ANC visit in the current pregnancy during the survey period. Routine HIV counselling and testing were done at the facility. A multivariable logistic regression model accounting for the survey design was used to examine factors associated with HIV infections.RESULTS: 38,783 pregnant women were enrolled (median age (IQR) = 25 (21-30) years). HIV prevalence was 5.9% (95%CI: 5.3% - 6.6%), ranging from 1.9% in the Manyara region to 16.4% in the Njombe region. Older age, lower and no education, not being in a marital union, and living in urban or semi-urban areas were associated with higher odds of HIV infection. HIV status awareness among women who tested positive was 70.9% (95% CI: 67.5%- 74.0%). ART coverage among those aware of their status was 91.6% (86.5%- 94.9%). Overall, 66.6% (95% CI: 62.4%- 70.6%) of all pregnant women who tested positive for HIV knew their HIV status and were on ART.CONCLUSION: HIV is increasingly prevalent among pregnant women in Tanzania mainland especially among older, those with lower or no formal education, those outside marital union, and pregnant women living in urban and semi-urban areas. Behind the global fast-target to end HIV/ AIDS, about a third of pregnant women living with HIV initiating ANC were not on ART. Interventions to increase HIV testing and linkage to care among women of reproductive age should be intensified.

TI  - Identification of Antimicrobial Resistance in Faecal Microbes from Wild Dugongs<i> (Dugong</i><i> dugon)</i>
T2  - AQUATIC MAMMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine and coastal waters are areas of potential concern for antimicrobial resistance because of the discharge of wastewater from sewage treatment plants and the run-off from urban and agricultural lands. Herein, we evaluate the antimicrobial resistance profiles in bacteria from dugongs (Dugong dugon), mammals that inhabit and feed in shallow coastal regions and, thus, are vulnerable to encountering water and sediment contaminated by human activities. Bacterial isolates were cultured from fresh faeces of four wild dugongs, as well as from one sediment sample from a dugong foraging ground in Queensland, Australia. Ten bacterial isolates underwent phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing using disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration testing, and genotypic resistance and virulence gene identification through whole genome sequencing. Four Staphylococcus warneri isolates and one Bacillus cereus isolate from dugong faeces were resistant to penicillin, with two S. warneri isolates also displaying resistance to trimethoprim. Four Escherichia coli isolates were all resistant to ampicillin. Resistance genes, including fosB, BcII, dfrC, blaZ, and mdfA, were identified in the isolates cultured from dugong faeces with two virulence genes (gad and lpfA) identified in all E. coli isolates. Lysinibacillus sphaericus cultured from the marine sediment and B. cereus from dugong faeces displayed phenotypic multidrug resistance (across categories of non extended spectrum cephalosporins, penicillins and beta-lactamase inhibitors, and clindamycin; and for L. sphaericus, phosphonic acids). These results demonstrate the role that dugongs can play as a sentinel species for antimicrobial resistance in the coastal waters across their range, which includes both disturbed urban and rural regions.

TI  - Using Zoos as Sentinels for Re-Emerging Arboviruses: Vector Surveillance during an Outbreak of Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease at the Minnesota Zoo
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vector-borne disease prevalence is increasing at a time when surveillance capacity in the United States is decreasing. One way to address this surveillance deficiency is to utilize established infrastructure, such as zoological parks, to investigate animal disease outbreaks and improve our epidemiological understanding of vector-borne pathogens. During fall 2020, an outbreak of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) at the Minnesota Zoo resulted in morbidity and seroconversion of several collection animals. In response to this outbreak, insect surveillance was conducted, and the collected insects were tested for the presence of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) by RT-qPCR to better understand the local transmitting vector populations responsible for the outbreak. Six pools of Culicoides biting midges were positive for EHDV, including three pools of Culicoides sonorensis, two pools of Culicoides variipennis, and a pool of degraded C. variipennis complex midges. All three endemic serotypes of EHDV (1, 2, and 6) were detected in both animals and midge pools from the premises. Despite this outbreak, no EHDV cases had been reported in wild animals near the zoo. This highlights the importance and utility of using animal holding facilities, such as zoos, as sentinels to better understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogen transmission.

TI  - Sound reasons for unsound sleep: Comparative support for the sentinel hypothesis in industrial and nonindustrial groups
T2  - EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lay Summary Sleep disruption may have been an evolved mechanism to increase alertness and safety in human ancestors that is still reflected in sleep patterns today. We found increased nighttime awakenings in nonindustrial Hadza and Malagasy compared to industrial groups, and that Hispanic participants experience more disruption than NHWs. Results suggest the need for improving sleep environment safety and addressing social sources of health disparities.Background and objectives Sleep is a vulnerable state in which individuals are more susceptible to threat, which may have led to evolved mechanisms for increasing safety. The sentinel hypothesis proposes that brief awakenings during sleep may be a strategy for detecting and responding to environmental threats. Observations of sleep segmentation and group sentinelization in hunter-gatherer and small-scale communities support this hypothesis, but to date it has not been tested in comparisons with industrial populations characterized by more secure sleep environments. Methodology Here, we compare wake after sleep onset (WASO), a quantitative measure of nighttime awakenings, between two nonindustrial and two industrial populations: Hadza hunter-gatherers (n = 33), Malagasy small-scale agriculturalists (n = 38), and Hispanic (n = 1,531) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) (n = 347) Americans. We compared nighttime awakenings between these groups using actigraphically-measured sleep data. We fit linear models to assess whether WASO varies across groups, controlling for sex and age. Results We found that WASO varies significantly by group membership and is highest in Hadza (2.44 h) and Malagasy (1.93 h) and lowest in non-Hispanic Whites (0.69 h). Hispanics demonstrate intermediate WASO (0.86 h), which is significantly more than NHW participants. After performing supplementary analysis within the Hispanic sample, we found that WASO is significantly and positively associated with increased perception of neighborhood violence. Conclusions and implications Consistent with principles central to evolutionary medicine, we propose that evolved mechanisms to increase vigilance during sleep may now be mismatched with relatively safer environments, and in part responsible for driving poor sleep health.

AB  - This article analyzes paleontologically- and geologically-themed poems in Mikhail Zenkevich's collection The Wild Porphyry in the context of key scientific discoveries at the turn of the last century. It argues that Zenkevich's speculative portraits of life on earth before humans expand the boundaries of Acmeist realism and Adamist primitivism. It also suggests that Zenkevich's planetary consciousness, which emerged amidst active efforts to popularize science, is a hallmark of a modern worldview and thus integral to understanding Russian modernist culture.

TI  - Snap-shot assessment of adult mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) densities on the Turks and Caicos Islands, February 2022.
T2  - Journal of the European Mosquito Control Association
M3  - Article
AB  - In many of the small island communities of the Caribbean, much of the vector surveillance effort is focussed on house-to-house peri-focal surveys to collect data on larval indices. Adult mosquito trapping is not always routine or affordable and is usually focussed on ad hoc biting issues or small-scale investigations. This makes understanding the relative importance and densities of the common urban mosquitoes, such as Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, problematic. This snap-shot survey in February 2022 using BG-Sentinel traps at 30 different locations across five islands of the Turks and Caicos, aimed to provide the first island-wide assessment of urban mosquito densities. In total, 2,820 adult mosquitoes were collected over 285 trap nights. Aedes aegypti was most common on the island of Providenciales, with very low densities recorded on South Caicos, North and Middle Caicos, with Ae. aegypti most highly abundant in the main commercial centres. The highest densities of Cx. quinquefasciatus were trapped on North Caicos. Small numbers of other species were also collected, including the first record of Anopheles in TCI. This established framework of trapping and initial assessment provides a platform for continued monitoring of mosquitoes in TCI to better inform mosquito-borne disease risk assessment and future vector control efforts.

TI  - Diagnosis of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with cancer of the larynx and laryngopharynx using a new radiopharmaceutical based on technetium-99m-labeled gamma aluminum oxide
T2  - BYULLETEN SIBIRSKOY MEDITSINY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. To study the possibility of using a radiopharmaceutical based on aluminum oxide labeled with Tc-99m ([Tc-99m]-Al2O3) for the diagnosis of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in tumors of the larynx and laryngopharynx in comparison with a phytate colloid ([Tc-99m]-phytate colloid).Materials and methods. The study included patients with cancer of the larynx and laryngopharynx (T2-4N0M0) (n = 54). In the prospective group (n = 30), [Tc-99m]-Al2O3 was used as a radiopharmaceutical, in the retrospective group (n = 24), [Tc-99m]-phytate colloid was used. All radiopharmaceuticals were introduced endoscopically into the submucosal space along the periphery of the tumor. After 18 hours, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and intraoperative SLN detection were performed.Results. In the retrospective group, SLNs were detected in 20 out of 24 patients. A total of 32 lymph nodes were identified in the retrospective group. The median number of detected lymph nodes in one patient was 1.3 [0-3], the intensity of the radiopharmaceutical uptake on scintigrams was 2.2 [0.7-8.1], intraoperatively - 4 [1.6-9.0]. In the prospective group, [Tc-99m]-Al2O3 uptake in the lymph nodes of the neck was determined in 27 patients (90%); in 3 patients, SLNs were not visualized. A total of 57 lymph nodes were identified (in 27 patients). The median number of visualized SLNs was 1.5 [0-5], the intensity of [Tc-99m]-Al2O3 uptake according to SPECT and intraoperative detection was 4.8 [0.7-19.4] and 6 [1.1-22.0], respectively.Conclusion. The most significant advantage of using [Tc-99m]-Al2O3 as a radiopharmaceutical is its high uptake in SLNs, which leads to an increase in the sensitivity of the method as a whole up to 90 versus 83% when using [Tc-99m]-phytate colloid.

TI  - Detection of Geocryological Conditions in Boreal Landscapes of the Southern Cryolithozone Using Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study of the Northern Part of the Yenisei Ridge
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the potential of using infrared remote sensing data to determine geocryological conditions in the northern part of the Yenisei Ridge in Russia. Landsat-8 thermal infrared images and land surface data were used for our analysis. The obtained thermal characteristics were compared with vegetation indices calculated for the period of active vegetation growth along several surface transects. Surface observations included geobotanical descriptions, phytomass estimations, measurements of thickness of the seasonally thawed layer, and visual identification of different effects of permafrost on the components of the taiga landscape. The obtained surface temperatures differed depending of forest type due to their bio-productivity characteristics on sporadic permafrost as the most important factor of forest growth conditions within the southern part of the cryolithozone. The differences in the thermal characteristics are due to varying degree of permafrost influence on boreal vegetation growth. The surface temperature was used as indicator to quantify the relationship between the latent heat and the sensible heat fluxes for the corresponding landscape. The areas with higher surface temperatures were usually characterized by higher sensible heat flux due to lower evapotranspiration of the plant canopy. The forest types with the highest evapotranspiration had usually the lowest surface temperatures. Such forest types are also the most fire-resistant systems, and have the highest water-discharge potential. This is characteristic of the forests under the lowest impact of permafrost (thawed soils or the presence of the permafrost layer at lower depths). Such types of forests have higher ecosystem service potential (e.g., fire-resistance and stock formation).

Using land surface temperature (LST) data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) for years 2006 to 2020, we quantified the temporal trends of daytime and nighttime surface UHI intensity (SUHII, difference of urban temperature to rural temperature) using the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test in six major cities of the Punjab province of Pakistan and estimated the future SUHII for the year 2030 using the ARIMA model. Results from the study revealed that the average mean SUHII for daytime was noted as 2.221 degrees C and the average mean nighttime SUHII was noted as 2.82 degrees C for the years 2006 to 2020. The average mean SUHII for daytime and nighttime exhibited increasing trends for all seasons and annually, and for the daytime spring season it showed a maximum upward trend of 0.486 degrees C/year (p < 0.05) and for the nighttime annual SUHII with an increasing rate of 0.485 degrees C/year (p < 0.05) which exhibited a maximum upward trend. The ARIMA model forecast suggested an increase of 0.04 degrees C in the average daytime SUHII and an increase of 0.1 degrees C in the average nighttime SUHII until 2030. The results from this study highlight the increasing trends of daytime and nighttime SUHII, ARIMA also forecasted an increase in daytime and nighttime SUHII, suggesting various strategies are needed for an effective mitigation of the UHI effect.

TI  - Forecasting Air Quality in Kiev During 2022 Military Conflict Using Sentinel 5P and Optimized Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that the Ukraine-Russia war has incurred evident changes to anthropogenic activities in the Kiev metropolis. Hence, this work employs Sentinel 5P imagery and a novel artificial intelligence model for predicting air pollution in Kiev. A well-known machine learning (ML) model, namely, multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), is coupled with electromagnetic field optimization (EFO) algorithm to predict the daily concentration of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). Initially, a dataset is prepared by collecting 11 meteorological, atmospheric, and temporal factors from remote sensing and ground measurements. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to determine the most contributive factors and create a reduced dataset. Four scenarios are defined by considering the reduced/original dataset, along with, predicting the current day/one-day-ahead PM2.5. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the most accurate results were achieved for predicting one-day-ahead PM2.5 using the reduced dataset. After adjusting the EFO-MLPNN hybrid model, its performance is compared to classical MLPNN and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). According to the results, the EFO-MLPNN with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.68 mu g center dot m(-3) and Pearson correlation coefficient (R-P) of 0.82 outperformed both MLPNN and ANFIS outcomes. These findings infer that by optimizing the MLPNN by EFO, its prediction accuracy can be improved. The proposed hybrid model is therefore recommended for more practical air quality estimation and decision-making in the studied site. Lastly, a monolithic neural-based formula is extracted from the EFO-MLPNN hybrid for the explicit prediction of PM2.5.

TI  - Innovative Fuzzy Models for Mapping <i>Acacia catechu </i>Using Semi-Hypertemporal Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of semi-hypertemporal (SH) satellite data can play an important role in species differentiation based on the physiological and phenological characteristics of different plant species in a forest. Mapping of plant species is essential for addressing problems related to their management and conservation. This study has been conducted to map Acacia catechu from a heterogeneous forest area using SH images in fuzzy-based classifiers. This study has claimed that an individual sample as mean (ISM) training approach outperforms the conventional mean-based approach for selecting the training samples for fuzzy-based possibilistic $c$ means (PCM), noise clustering (NC), and modified PCM (MPCM) algorithms. Furthermore, the SH dataset is found to be better for a particular species extraction in contrast to the single date image, using both the conventional and ISM approaches. Moreover, an increasing number of images in the SH dataset produces significantly better classification outputs. This study can be used to map the endangered species with improved classification accuracy and for better management practices.

TI  - Effect of land use land cover change on runoff characteristics using curve number: a GIS and remote sensing approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Runoff is an important hydrological process and can cause negative effects such as soil erosion, excessive flooding over the river basin area. Changes in land use land cover are dynamic processes and can strongly influence runoff potential in the long run. The objective of the study is to analyse runoff from the curve number for different land use land cover classes and to derive land use land cover effect on runoff over Ambica river basin using QGIS for a period of 20 years, i.e., 1990-2010. SRTM digital elevation maps, Landsat 5 images, and soil maps extracted from the global hydrological soil group were processed in QGIS. A semi-automatic classification plugin was used for land use land cover classification and land cover classes such as urban area, forest, barren land, vegetation, and water bodies were identified. Significant changes in land use land cover patterns were observed during the study period. The results on the effect of land-use change on runoff can be seen as a warning for landuse managers and policymakers, who should aim at stopping and reversing the current land-use trends of the Ambica river basin.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of water use efficiency and its driving factors in Inner Mongolia from 2001 to 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important variable to explore coupled relationships in carbon and water cycles. In this study, we first compared the spatial variations of annual gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) using four GPP and ET products. Second, we selected the products closest to the flux towers data to estimate WUE. Finally, we quantitatively analyzed the impact of climate change and soil water content on WUE. The results showed that: (1) Four GPP and ET products provided good performance, with GOSIF-GPP and FLDAS-ET exhibiting a higher correlation and the smallest errors with the flux tower data. (2) The spatial pattern of WUE is consistent with that of GPP and ET, gradually decreasing from the northeast to the southwest. Higher WUE values appeared in the northeast forest ecosystem, and lower WUE values occurred in the western Gobi Desert, with a value of 0.28 gC m(-2) mm(-1). The GPP and ET products showed an increasing trend, while WUE showed a decreasing trend (55.15%) from 2001 to 2020. (3) The spatial relationship between WUE and driving factors reveal the variations in WUE of Inner Mongolia are mainly affected by soil moisture between 0 and 10 cm (SM0-10cm), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and precipitation, respectively. (4) In arid regions, VPD and precipitation exhibit a major influence on WUE. An increase in VPD and precipitation has a negative and positive effect on WUE, with threshold values of approximately 0.36 kPa and 426 mm, respectively. (5) In humid regions, SM0-10cm, VPD, SM10-40cm, and SM40-100cm exert a significant impact on WUE, especially SM0-10cm, and weakens with increasing soil depths, these differences may be related to physiological structure and living characteristics of vegetation types in different climate regimes. Our results emphasize the importance of VPD and soil moisture in regional variability in WUE.

TI  - Irrigation Mapping at Different Spatial Scales: Areal Change with Resolution Explained by Landscape Metrics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of irrigated areas still represents a complex and laborious challenge in land use classification. The extent and location of irrigated areas vary in both methodology and scale. One major reason for discrepancies is the choice of spatial resolution. This study evaluates the influence of spatial resolution on the mapped extent and spatial patterns of irrigation using an NDVI threshold approach with Sentinel-2 and operational PROBA-V data. The influence of resolution on irrigation mapping was analyzed in the USA, China and Sudan to cover a broad range of agricultural systems by comparing results from original 10 m Sentinel-2 data with mapped coarser results at 20 m, 40 m, 60 m, 100 m, 300 m, 600 m and 1000 m and with results from PROBA-V. While the mapped irrigated area in China is constant independent of resolution, it decreases in Sudan (-29%) and the USA (-48%). The differences in the mapping result can largely be explained by the spatial arrangement of the irrigated pixels at a fine resolution. The calculation of landscape metrics in the three regions shows that the Landscape Shape Index (LSI) can explain the loss of irrigated area from 10 m to 300 m (r > 0.9).

TI  - ADAfinder Tool Applied to EGMS Data for the Structural Health Monitoring of Urban Settlements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The new European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) opens a new prospect in the study of the ground deformation phenomena influencing structures and infrastructures, at regional scale, exploiting the huge archives of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired from Sentinel-1 satellites. The research is currently oriented toward developing new methodologies to exploit this great volume of data, the management of which is difficult and onerous in terms of time. A new methodology for the monitoring of the deformations of urban settlements, based on the application of the ADAfinder tool to EGMS measure points, is proposed in this work. It targets the semi-automatic extraction of active deformation areas (ADA), given in the form of maps, with the goal to identify the buildings affected by displacements above a given threshold among all the buildings included in the investigated area. This allows a smart selection of the buildings needing insights about their condition through on-site monitoring or inspections, providing real support for the management of the urban areas. The proposed methodology is applied to two different case study areas in the city of Barcelona (Spain): the Eixample, in the heart of the city, and the Zona Franca, an industrial area near to the harbor.

T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article aims to indicate the role of info-communication technologies in the conversion of the cultural reality of the postmodern era. The elements of pluralism, decentration, fragmentation, and play as the major principles of postmodern culture are revealed. In the context of the virtualization of the socio-cultural space, humanistic values are of great importance. The most demanded form of communication is polylogue. It reflects the transition from traditional communicative interaction to modern. The contemporary development period of civil society, culture, and civilization is characterized by a new stage in the evolution of the nature of the leading social processes. It is distinguished by the desire of a developed industrial society to improve its social structures and institutions. The study talks about the active entry into the community's life with the latest information technologies, which occurred due to the rapid development of electronics. The formation and dissemination of a particular type of mindset and worldview, conceptualized in some philosophical, sociological, literary, and cultural theories, has become widely known under the general name "postmodernism. " The need to comprehend these two significant phenomena for the current era determines the subject of this article.

TI  - The effect of positron emission tomography/computed tomography in axillary surgery approach after neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer
T2  - REVISTA DA ASSOCIACAO MEDICA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the role of positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the decision to perform axillary surgery by comparing positron emission tomography/computed tomography findings with pathology consistency after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed for T1-4, cN1/2 breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy in our clinic between January 2016 and February 2021 were evaluated. Clinical and radiological responses, axillary surgery, and histopathological results after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were evaluated. RESULTS: Axillary involvement was not detected in positron emission tomography/computed tomography after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 140 (60.6%) of 231 node-positive patients. In total, 88 (62.8%) of these patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, and axillary lymph node dissection was performed in 29 (33%) of these patients upon detection of 1 or 2 positive lymph nodes. The other 52 (37.1%) patients underwent direct axillary lymph node dissection, and no metastatic lymph nodes were detected in 33 (63.4%) patients. No metastatic lymph node was found pathologically in a total of 92 patients without involvement in positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and the negative predictive value was calculated as 65.7%. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed in 91 (39.4%) patients with axillary involvement in positron emission tomography/computed tomography after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Metastatic lymph nodes were found pathologically in 83 of these patients, and the positive predictive value was calculated as 91.2%. CONCLUSION: Positron emission tomography/computed tomography was found to be useful in the evaluation of clinical response, but it was not sufficient enough to predict a complete pathological response. When planning axillary surgery, axillary lymph node dissection should not be decided only with a positive positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Other radiological images should also be evaluated, and a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy should be the determinant of axillary lymph node dissection.

TI  - Embedded System Development for Detection of Railway Track Surface Deformation Using Contour Feature Algorithm
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
M3  - Article
AB  - Derailment of trains is not unusual all around the world, especially in developing countries, due to unidentified track or rolling stock faults that cause massive casualties each year. For this purpose, a proper condition mon-itoring system is essential to avoid accidents and heavy losses. Generally, the detection and classification of railway track surface faults in real-time requires massive computational processing and memory resources and is prone to a noisy environment. Therefore, in this paper, we present the development of a novel embedded system prototype for condition monitoring of railway track. The proposed prototype system works in real-time by acquiring railway track surface images and performing two tasks a) detect deformation (i.e., faults) like squats, shelling, and spalling using the contour feature algorithm and b) the vibration signature on that faulty spot by synchronizing acceleration and image data. A new illumination scheme is also proposed to avoid the sunlight reflection that badly affects the image acquisition process. The contour detection algorithm is applied here to detect the uneven shapes and discontinuities in the geometrical structure of the railway track surface, which ultimately detects unhealthy regions. It works by converting Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) images into binary images, which distinguishes the unhealthy regions by making them white color while the healthy regions in black color. We have used the multiprocessing technique to overcome the massive processing and memory issues. This embedded system is developed on Raspberry Pi by interfacing a vision camera, an accelerometer, a proximity sensor, and a Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors (i.e., multi-sensors). The developed embedded system prototype is tested in real-time onsite by installing it on a Railway Inspection Trolley (RIT), which runs at an average speed of 15 km/h. The functional verification of the proposed system is done successfully by detecting and recording the various railway track surface faults. An unhealthy frame's onsite detection processing time was recorded at approximately 25.6 ms. The proposed system can synchronize the acceleration data on specific railway track deformation. The proposed novel embedded system may be beneficial for detecting faults to overcome the conventional manual railway track condition monitoring, which is still being practiced in various developing or underdeveloped countries.

TI  - Long term (2005-2016) study of formaldehyde (HCHO) columns from satellite data in two regions in the south of Mexico. Evidence of the impact of agricultural activity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to determine the driver factors and the principal months of enhancement of HCHO over the Oaxaca and the Chiapas regions, important agricultural areas located in the south of Mexico, HCHO columns from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) were monthly averaged (HCHOOMI) and used in conjunction with monthly averaged isoprene emissions (isoprene), monthly NOx emissions from biomass burning (NOx_bb), and monthly averaged NOx emissions from soils with their different sources (biomes: NOx_bio, fertilization and manure: NOx_fer, deposition of N: NOx_dep, pulses: NOx_pul, and total: NOx_tot) from January 2005 to December 2016. Based on scatterplots grouped by month due to the seasonality of the variables, Spearman rank correlations, and multiple linear regression models, we determined that isoprene was an important driver of HCHOOMI in the Oaxaca region, contributing both to its seasonality and peak presence during April and May; whereas NOx_bb was a relevant source in the enhancement of HCHOOMI during April and May, months in which the fire season occurs in the south of Mexico. In the Chiapas region, we determined that both isoprene and NOx_fer were important drivers of the seasonality of HCHOOMI and its peak months during April and May. NOx_bb was predominantly involved in the HCHOOMI enhancement during April and May. The overall multiple linear regression model for each study region was significant (F-statistic = 21.35, p < 0.0001 for the Oaxaca region; F-statistic = 101.59, p < 0.0001 for the Chiapas region) and explained 72% of the variation of HCHOOMI in the Oaxaca region, 85% in the Chiapas region. Based on the multiple linear regression model for each study region, monthly averaged modeled HCHO columns (HCHOMOD) were obtained. With the estimated regression coefficients, the contribution (in %) of the relevant emission fluxes for each region were calculated in order to know which source was the predominant one in the exacerbation of HCHOMOD. During the peak months of HCHOMOD (April and May) in the Oaxaca region, isoprene predominates over NOx_bb. In the Chiapas region both NOx_bb and NOx_fer caused the exacerbation of HCHOMOD during April and May, whereas NOx_fer was the major variable that caused the increase of HCHOMOD during June, July, and August, especially from 2014 to 2016. Overall, in this region the emissions of NOx were more important in the increase of HCHOMOD than isoprene. NOx_bb and NOx_fer were enhanced principally due to the agricultural activity taking place in the Oaxaca and Chiapas regions. Thus, this work demonstrates the impact of agricultural activity on HCHO columns observed by the OMI instrument. In addition, this work shows that HCHO columns can be modeled using HCHO columns obtained from satellite data and emission inventories. The analysis performed here can be applied to other similar regions not only in Mexico but elsewhere around the world.

TI  - Effects of an Episodic Storm-Induced Flooding Event on the Biogeochemistry of a Shallow, Highly Turbid, Semi-Enclosed Embayment (Laizhou Bay, Bohai Sea)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Episodic storm-induced flooding is becoming more frequent with a warming climate, which may alter the biogeochemical properties and conditions of estuaries. However, the effects of such extreme events on semi-enclosed bay ecosystems have not been fully investigated because of the difficulty in collecting in situ samples. To address this issue, a comparative study was carried out to understand the biogeochemical changes in Laizhou Bay, a shallow, highly turbid, semi-enclosed bay, by coupling satellite data and surface water samplings collected during an episodic flooding event (August 2018) and during a non-flooding period (August 2017). The results showed that the 2018 Shouguang flood delivered large amounts of suspended solids, phosphorus, and organic matter-enriched terrigenous materials into Laizhou Bay and enhanced the offshore expansion of the low-salinity seawater plume and associated nutrient fronts. Water total suspended solid (TSS) particle and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations increased by 23.79 g/m(3) and 0.63 mg/m(3), respectively, on average in the freshwater mixing water plume around the Mi River. Episodic flooding is a crucial driver which temporally dominates the spatial patterns of water biogeochemistry. These results are essential to anticipate the ecosystem response of estuarine regions to the high episodic freshwater flow associated with the increasing storms.

TI  - PanDiff: A Novel Pansharpening Method Based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is a crucial image processing technique for numerous remote sensing downstream tasks, aiming to recover high spatial resolution multispectral images by fusing high spatial resolution panchromatic (PAN) images and low spatial resolution multispectral (LRMS) images. Most current mainstream pansharpening fusion frameworks directly learn the mapping relationships from PAN and LRMS images to high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images by extracting key features. However, we propose a novel pansharpening method based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) called PanDiff, which learns the data distribution of the difference maps (DMs) between HRMS and interpolated MS (IMS) images from a new perspective. Specifically, PanDiff decomposes the complex fusion process of PAN and LRMS images into a multistep Markov process, and the U-Net is employed to reconstruct each step of the process from random Gaussian noise. Notably, the PAN and LRMS images serve as the injected conditions to guide the U-Net in PanDiff, rather than being the fusion objects as in other pansharpening methods. Furthermore, we propose a modal intercalibration module (MIM) to enhance the guidance effect of the PAN and LRMS images. The experiments are conducted on a freely available benchmark dataset, including GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 images. The experimental results from the fusion and generalization tests effectively demonstrate the outstanding fusion performance and high robustness of PanDiff. The results of the proposed method performed on various scenes are shown. In addition, the ablation experiments confirm the rationale behind PanDiff's construction.

TI  - Estimating Hourly Land Surface Temperature From FY-4A AGRI Using an Explicitly Emissivity-Dependent Split-Window Algorithm
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface emissivity (LSE) has been roughly treated in the current split-window (SW) land surface temperature (LST) retrieval algorithms. This article extended the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Joint Polar Satellite System enterprise algorithm to Feng Yun-4A/Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) thermal infrared data by incorporating a daily LSE database for high-temporal-resolution LST retrieval. To improve the retrieval accuracy, day/night SW algorithm coefficients were calculated for different total water vapor content and view zenith angle conditions using a simulation database constructed by moderate spectral resolution atmospheric transmittance model version 5.2 and SeeBor V5.0 atmospheric profiles. The validation results show that the daily AGRI LSE has better accuracy than the LSE retrieved from the vegetation cover method (VCM), with average biases of -1.1x10(-3) and -6x10(-3) for channels 12 and 13. The accuracy of the AGRI LST retrieved using the daily AGRI LSE is slightly better than that retrieved using the VCM-retrieved LSE. The overall bias, MAE, and root mean square error of the AGRI LST retrieved using the daily AGRI LSE at 14 in situ sites are 0.11, 2.55, and 2.55 K, respectively, whereas these values are -0.11, 2.70, and 2.70 K, respectively, for the LST using the VCM-retrieved LSE. This study demonstrates that the daily LSE constructed from physically retrieved LSE can improve the accuracy of LST retrieved with the SW algorithm. The constructed daily LSE has high spatial coverage and dynamic emissivity information and can provide nearly complete spatial coverage if supplemented by the constructed eight-day or monthly AGRI LSE. It can also be applied to other LST retrieval algorithms that need LSE a priori.

TI  - Multitemporal Speckle Reduction With Self-Supervised Deep Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Speckle filtering is generally a prerequisite to the analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Tremendous progress has been achieved in the domain of single-image despeckling. Latest techniques rely on deep neural networks to restore the various structures and textures peculiar to SAR images. The availability of time series of SAR images offers the possibility of improving speckle filtering by combining different speckle realizations over the same area. The supervised training of deep neural networks requires ground-truth speckle-free images. Such images can only be obtained indirectly through some form of averaging, by spatial or temporal integration, and are imperfect. Given the potential of very high-quality restoration reachable by multitemporal speckle filtering, the limitations of ground-truth images need to be circumvented. We extend a recent self-supervised training strategy for single-look complex (SLC) SAR images, called MERLIN, to the case of multitemporal filtering. This requires modeling the sources of statistical dependencies in the spatial and temporal dimensions as well as between the real and imaginary components of the complex amplitudes. Quantitative analysis on datasets with simulated speckle indicates a clear improvement of speckle reduction when additional SAR images are included. Our method is then applied to stacks of TerraSAR-X images and shown to outperform competing multitemporal speckle filtering approaches. The code of the trained models and supplementary results are made freely available at https://gitlab.telecom-paris.fr/ring/multitemporal-merlin/.

TI  - Distribution Modeling and Gap Analysis of Shorebird Conservation in Northern Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Migratory shorebirds are currently at significant risk, with populations of multiple species dropping globally, often due to habitat disruption and loss. The coast of northern Brazil, along the states of Para and Maranhao, encompasses one of the broadest expanses of shorebird overwintering habitat for many shorebird species in the Atlantic Americas Flyway. Delineating how current management protects shorebird habitat is an important first step to identifying gaps in protections that then need to be prioritized. Different frameworks of conservation decision-making, such as focusing on flagship, umbrella, or biodiversity, can be used to prioritize what habitat needs to be protected. Understanding the effects of these different conservation perspectives is key to making informed management decisions. Multiple dates of Landsat 8 imagery at different tidal stages were used to identify intertidal habitats for further analysis. MaxEnt species distribution models were derived for each species using remote sensing and landscape metrics, as well as point-count survey data collected during the winters of 2016 and 2017. Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 image data were included as direct inputs to the model rather than interpreted and mapped first into different habitat types. The resulting Maxent models successfully delineated between presence and absence locations for five of the eight target shorebird species. The model outputs were combined to map the intertidal habitat covered under several different management scenarios. These scenarios included using red knots as a flagship species, semipalmated sandpipers as an umbrella species, and species richness as a metric of shorebird diversity. Slightly more than 25% of delineated intertidal habitat was found to be included within a designated Marine Extractive Reserve, with three major gaps in current protections identified. The flagship, umbrella, and biodiversity perspectives result in different prioritizations of these distinct locations. While umbrella and diversity approaches are successful at protecting diverse communities, community assemblages of rarer or specialist species, such as the red knots, may fall outside their protective shadows. A hybrid approach that uses both diversity and the extent of rare flagship species produces results that best meet the management goals of identifying gaps in existing conservation to protect the most at-risk species while conserving the diverse assemblages they coexist with.

TI  - The image of the Other as a reflection of cultural identity (a case study of Russian postmodern prose and dramaturgy)
T2  - WORLD LITERATURE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the strategies for creation of the images of the Other and the One-of-Us as exemplified in postmodern prose and dramaturgy (Evgenii Grishkovets' drama Zapiski russkogo puteshestvennika [Notes of a Russian traveler], 2011; Maria Arbatova's dramatic travelogue Po doroge k sebe [Eng. trans. On the Road to Ourselves, 1998], [1992] 1999; Vladimir Tuchkov's hypertext novel "Russkii I Tszin" [Russian I Ching], 2009; Valerii Kislov's comical treatise "Kratkii kurs u-vei" [A short course on wu wei], 2009). The close attention to the images of the East and the West and emphasis placed on similarities and differences with the Russian worldview is driven by the transitional character of Russian culture and its search for identity. The dominant strategy emerges in reviewing the outdated images of the Other and the One-of-Us. By creating these images, the authors employ a range of strategies: demythologization/mythologization, inversion, and apophatics. The common intention of the works lies in promoting cultural dialogue.

TI  - Eccrine Porocarcinoma: Clinical and Histopathological Study of 14 Patients with Special Emphasis on Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
T2  - ACTA DERMATO-VENEREOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Eccrine porocarcinoma is a rare skin adnexal tumour that affects elderly people. Most eccrine porocarcino-mas are stage I or II according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer. The prognosis is good in early stages, but worsens when advanced. Since informa-tion on the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy in these patients is scarce, this study examined the records of all patients with eccrine porocarcinoma treated at Hel-sinki University Hospital during a 17-year period and focused on sentinel lymph node biopsy patients. The study identified 14 patients (9 male, 5 female). There were 2 metastases to the lymph nodes and 2 recur-rences at initial referral to our institution. All primary tumours had wide local excision and 6 patients also had sentinel lymph node biopsy, of whom none had positive lymph nodes. There were no new metastases or recurrences during follow-up. Three patients died of causes other than eccrine porocarcinoma. When com-paring the wide local excision only and wide local ex-cision with sentinel lymph node biopsy groups, no pa-rameters reached statistical significance. The decision process of the multidisciplinary tumour board meeting on whether to perform sentinel lymph node biopsy was not clear, perhaps due to the limited knowledge of ec-crine porocarcinoma. Further studies and international collaboration are warranted.

TI  - A shelter from the abyss: exploring Cicely Saunders' vision of hospice care through the concept of worldview.
T2  - Palliative care and social practice
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Over the past two decades, a debate has arisen concerning the history and philosophy of hospice and palliative care. This critical essay extends this debate by linking the analysis of Dame Cicely Saunders' writings with the concept of worldview, exploring the modern hospice movement vis-a-vis Saunders' approach to terminal care. Worldviews as cultural classifications of reality provide groups and individuals with meaning to navigate everyday and liminal situations. Using this concept in connection to the discipline of the sociology of knowledge, it is possible to grasp how the origins and principles of modern hospice care, from which current palliative care practices evolved, relate to the sociocultural environment of the postwar era in the West. The analysis focuses on a selected body of Saunders' writings, mainly written in the 1960s and 1970s, and discusses different components and functions of her revolutionary care paradigm. In this essay, I show that Saunders' vision of hospice care entails much more than a set of health care practices; it is a complex construct of knowledge and ideas that offers distinct procedures to shelter the dying from pain and loss of meaning. Her vision builds on medical advances and incorporates norms and attitudes related to secularised Protestant and New Age culture, which fostered privatised types of religion and individualistic ideologies and theodicies.

AB  - Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) field gained increasing interest during the last years, also due to the huge amount of civil structures and infrastructures near or beyond their design life, and needs to be managed, particularly in a multi-hazard prone area like Italy. In this context, the advanced multi-temporal differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar (MT-DInSAR) techniques represent a great potential for the SHM applications and future development. The exploitation of such techniques in the monitoring and structural assessment of the built environment is still an open issue even if some first applications are available in literature showing promising potentialities. In this work, after a brief description of the general framework for structural monitoring and assessment, previously proposed by the authors, the case study of the Torri Stellari buildings in Rome (Italy) is presented and critically discussed. In particular, starting from COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) ascending and descending SAR datasets and applying the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) DInSAR processing technique, the measurement points of the investigated area are obtained for both acquisition geometries. Different techniques are applied to both the displacement time series and mean deformation velocity for assessing the structural behavior or monitoring of constructions.

Robotic Firefl y Da Vinci fluorescence imaging system (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) vs. laparoscopic Novadaq Pinpoint near-infrared imaging system (Novadaq, Ontario, Canada). Material and method: Fifteen patients with stage I endometrial cancer underwent sentinel lymph node bio psy after intracervical application of indocyanine green. For all of them, the detection was performed sequentially using both evaluated devices. The detection rate, identification match and extent of imaging of the lymphatic system were evaluated. Results: The detection rate of both systems verified on a set of patients was identical, the detected sentinel nodes were identical, and the lymphatic system was shown to the same extent. The quality of the display and overall user-friendliness is different due to the applied technologies. Conclusion: Both systems used in minimally invasive surgery provide excelent perioperative imaging of the lymphatic system.

AB  - Transportation networks infrastructure ageing, deterioration and maintenance present a global problem and their loss translates to a loss of movement and transportation, trade and commerce, among others. The use of remote sensing technologies (non-invasive) is an efficient solution to enhancing the condition assessment of these from large-scale networks to single sections supporting improved decision making. Nowadays, the availability of a large amount of SAR data can be implemented in a Web-Based Spatial Decision Support System (WB-SDSS) platform to provide a powerful instrument for quick diagnosis to stakeholders. To this aim, a novel WB-SDSS solution has been developed in the Angular workspace. The IT architecture is based on PostgreSQL relational databases, periodically updated with new SAR data acquired and processed, and shared with users thanks to Geoserver services. The implemented Python code allows visualizing time series of Permanent Scatterers (PSs) obtained from free-of-charge SAR imagery in addition to data acquired by in-situ instruments (i.e. inclinometers, piezometers, etc.). Finally, to provide a useful instrument for quick diagnosis to stakeholders, employing the methodology of the I-Pro MONALISA algorithm presented by [1] the road network has been discretized in terms of areas with different degrees of attention.

TI  - Criticism of "Technotronic Civilization" by Piama Gaidenko in the Aspect of<i> Kulturkritik</i>
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - Piama Pavlovna Gaidenko is most often referred to as a brilliant historian of phi-losophy, the author of the original concept of the evolution of science, but her work clearly shows interest in ontological and "existentialist" topics, which sug-gests the existence of a certain coherent philosophical project that demonstrates elements of the Christian worldview. Dealing with the issues of the genesis of European rationality, Gaidenko as philosopher was always guided by the task of overcoming the "paradigm of thinking" that was born at the beginning of the Modernity and was associated with the figure of a knowing and creative "subject" who denies the complexity and multidimensionality of the world, who undertakes to rebuild in a revolutionary way. To put an end to the dominance of "deontologized subjectivism", leading to anthropological, ecological and other crises, is possible only through the restoration of the damaged reputation of ra-tio, through a new understanding of the collision of knowledge and faith, which reflects the tragedy of Western European culture, which has forgotten about God and being. According to our hypothesis, behind the standard designations of such Soviet philosophical topics as "criticism of European rationalism", "criticism of bourgeois aesthetics", "criticism of non-Marxist concepts of dialectics", etc. - a peculiar cultural-critical approach is traced, which, on the one hand, can be compared with the German Kulturkritik of the 20th century, and on the other hand, demonstrates the ontologism which is typical for the Russian philosophical tradition. We single out three elements of the philosophical project of P. Gaidenko: 1) criticism of mass society and the "tragedy of aestheticism", 2) criticism of technocracy and "breakthrough to the transcendent", 3) appeal to the ontologi-cal roots of reason and values. We propose to clarify them, outlining the ways of typological comparison with special discourses within the conservative criti-cism of modernity - in particular, criticism of massification, criticism of techno-logy, problems of value and worldview orientation.

T2  - SLOVENSKA LITERATURA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article tackles selected representations of animals in Ivan Laucik's (1944 - 2004) poetry. From the wide range of animals which the poet invites into his verse, it focuses on the motifs of insects, birds, and whales. In the world of Laucik's poetry, insects serve as a litmus test for the quality and viability of an ecosystem. The poet, however, also handles insects in relation to the question of the expressive possibilities of language. Laucik's ethical and ecological worldview also encompasses numerous motifs of birds which serve functions similar to those of insects. The motif of the whale occupies an important position in the poet's debut collection, Pohyblivy v pohyblivom ([Mobile within mobility] 1968) and is also an indicator of how people relate to fauna and nature in general: as either conquerors or explorers. The ideal of a peaceful cohabitation of humankind with other animals can be glimpsed in Laucik's handling of the human as a "human animal." Such ethos can be observed both in individual poems and in the poet's system of values in general. It accentuates an eco-friendly attitude towards nature to which the human is radically related.

TI  - A two-sex integrated population model reveals intersexual differences in life history strategies in Cooper's hawks
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated population models (IPMs) combine population counts with demographic data to improve the precision of estimates of population size and demographic rates. IPMs can also provide information on demographic parameters for which data are lacking (e.g., immigration) if other sufficient information is available. IPMs often use demographic data from one sex, usually females, implicitly assuming the chosen sex adequately represents the species' life history; for highly size-dimorphic raptors, that assumption may not hold true. We developed a two-sex IPM for a New Mexico population of the highly size-dimorphic Cooper's hawk (Accipiter cooperii) from 2011 to 2020 and compared estimates of life history characteristics between sexes. Because we had data to directly estimate sex- and age-specific probabilities of breeding, fecundity, survival, brood sex ratios, and emigration rates, we could indirectly estimate age-specific immigration rates for both sexes. Our two-sex IPM revealed that population growth was most strongly associated with increased immigration and decreased first-year (FY) emigration in females and with after-first-year (AFY) survival in males. Most males that were recruited as new breeders in our study area were AFY residents, whereas most female recruits were AFY immigrants. All females that fledged in our study area and survived until their first breeding season bred in their first year, whereas only 3% of surviving FY males bred. We found evidence of density dependence in the survival of AFY males (r = -0.11, 95% credible interval = -0.36 to -0.03) and in AFY female immigration (r = -0.17, 95% credible interval = -0.27 to -0.12). Our findings reveal that male and female Cooper's hawks differ in their response to population density, and in how they contribute to population growth. Thus, sexual differences in vital rates can be an important consideration in raptor population models.

TI  - EDUCATIONAL PERSPECTIVE OF FILMS ON DISABILITY
T2  - REVISTA CONRADO
M3  - Article
AB  - Learning aimed at raising awareness about disability can be done through the use of films based on real events. The objective of the work is to implement audiovisual me-dia as a didactic resource to achieve meaningful learning by modeling the awareness of disability in students of so-cial careers. The methodology used was the qualitative one for the purpose of the research to transform the reality regarding the worldview of this type of students towards disability. The fundamental results in this work allow us to better understand the usefulness of the films within the teaching-learning process, it has been shown that it is of interest to analyze aspects in the films such as: the con -text, the interpersonal relationships of the characters, the condition of health of the person or persons with disabi-lities, problematic situations, positive and negative attitu-des, the barriers they face, the school environment, and technical aids. It can be concluded that the guarantee of a quality and inclusive education is given by laws, where the correct treatment of stereotypes, prejudices, barriers and negative attitudes towards disability will allow us to have a more just and inclusive society. The films facilitate the dynamization of the chair, appropriation of positive va -lues and other sociocultural aspects that must be mode-led by human beings.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the principles and methods of Izutsu and.Allamah.aba.aba'i in the semantics of Quranic concepts, using a comparative analysis. Looking at his semantic principles, it becomes clear that.Allamah believed in more flexibility for the meaning of each word in the text, and this flexibility could bring him closer to the various messages incorporated into the text by the words used by the author, although he did not make full use of this capacity in practice. In contrast, Izutsu emphasized the principle that the meanings of words change in relation to individuals' changing worldview. Although this principle facilitated better semantics of the Quranic concepts, it also abandoned the basic core meaning of words, replacing them with alternative, false meanings. Additionally, it did not specify the principles of sentence semantics and had an ineffective method of analyzing conflicts in the meanings of a word in the text, especially in a religious text. The semantic principle used by All (a) over bar mah appears to be more efficient in understanding the real message of the text. Therefore, a fusion of his method with Izutsu's `semantic fields' would be a big step towards achieving a correct understanding of the meanings of Quranic words.

TI  - Detecting Clouds in Multispectral Satellite Images Using Quantum-Kernel Support Vector Machines
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Support vector machines (SVMs) are well-established classifiers that are effectively deployed in an array of classification tasks. In this article, we consider extending classical SVMs with quantum kernels and applying them to satellite data analysis. The design and implementation of SVMs with quantum kernels (hybrid SVMs) are presented. Here, the pixels are mapped to the Hilbert space using a family of parameterized quantum feature maps (related to quantum kernels). The parameters are optimized to maximize the kernel-target alignment. The quantum kernels have been selected such that they enable the analysis of numerous relevant properties while being able to simulate them with classical computers on a real-life large-scale dataset. Specifically, we approach the problem of cloud detection in the multispectral satellite imagery, which is one of the pivotal steps in both on-the-ground and on-board satellite image analysis processing chains. The experiments performed over the benchmark Landsat-8 multispectral dataset revealed that the simulated hybrid SVM successfully classifies satellite images with accuracy comparable to the classical SVM with the radial basis function kernel for large datasets. Interestingly, for large datasets, the high accuracy was also observed for the simple quantum kernels, lacking quantum entanglement.

TI  - Pseudo-Labeling Approach for Land Cover Classification Through Remote Sensing Observations With Noisy Labels
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data allows us to solve a wide range of challenging tasks remotely, including monitoring changing environmental conditions, assessing resources, and evaluating hazards. Computer vision algorithms such as convolutional neural networks have proven to be powerful tools for handling huge visual datasets. Although the number of satellite imagery is constantly growing and artificial intelligence is advancing, the present sticking point in remote sensing studies is the quality and amount of annotated datasets. Typically, manual labels have particular uncertainties and mismatches. Also, a lot of annotated datasets available in low resolution. Available visual representation of the observed objects can be more detailed than annotation. This causes the need for markup adjustment, which can be referred to as a pseudo-labeling task. The main contribution of this research is that we propose a pipeline for pseudo-labeling to address the problem of inaccurate and low-resolution markup improvement for solving land-cover and land-use segmentation task based on the data from the Sentinel-2 satellite. Our methodology takes advantages both of classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. We examine random sampling, uniform sampling, and K-Means sampling and compare it with the full dataset usage. U-Net, DeepLab, and FPN models are trained on the adjusted dataset. The achieved findings show that a simple yet effective approach of data preliminary sampling and further markup refinement leads to significantly higher results than just using raw inaccurate data in a deep neural network pipeline. Moreover, the considered sampling technique allows to use less data for ML model training. The experiments involve markup adjustment and up-scaling from 30m to 10m. We verify the proposed approach in precise test area with manual annotation and show the improvement in F1-score from 0.792 to 0.816.

T2  - EQA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - International Standards of Organization (ISO) management system standards certification (IMS) is the most common standard way to benefit the companies that decided to use it. The reason for this research is to analyze the performance of IMS consulting firms in Pakistan and the initiatives taken by the Government of Pakistan (GoP) in the implementation of IMS in the organizations with a moderating role of International Register of Certificated Auditors (IRCA) to maintain quality of products and services in Pakistan. A positivist examination worldview with expressive cross-sectional exploration configuration was chosen to gather essential information from the top-level management, the middle-level, and the low-level employees of ISO-certified firms and team members working in ISO consultancy firms. The data was collected from different cities using an online survey, skype, and telephone because of COVID-19 restrictions. The findings of this study are that there are a total of 31 ISO-certified consulting firms/certification bodies working in Pakistan. Only eight of these are registered with Pakistan National Accreditation Council (PNAC) whereas the remaining are unregistered. The reason identified for the lesser amount of ISO certification in Pakistan is the lack of interest from the GOP. It is because they are not providing any incentive programs to IMS consulting firms.

TI  - Crop classification by using dual-pol SAR vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-1 SAR-C data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the following study, an attempt is made for crop classification of rainy season through analyzing time-series Sentinel-1 SAR data of May 2020 to September 2020. The SVIDP index derived from dual-pol (VV and VH) bands consisting of NRPB (sigma(0)vh(ij) - sigma(0)vv(ij)/sigma(0)vh(ij )+ sigma(0)vv(ij)), DPDD (sigma(0)vh(ij) + sigma(0)vv(ij))/root 2), IDPDD (sigma(0)vv((max) )- sigma(0)vv(ij)) + sigma(0)vh(ij)/root 2), and VDDPI (sigma(0)vh(ij) + sigma(0)vv(ij)/sigma(0)vv(ij)) ratios are utilized for discriminating inter-vegetative boundaries of crop pixels. This study was conducted near Karnal city region, Karnal district, Haryana, India. The Sentinel-1 data has the capability to penetrate thick cloud cover and provide high revisit frequency data for rainfed crops. Obtained classification achieved higher accuracy in both RF (93.77%) and SVM (93.50%) classifiers. Obtained linear regression statistics of mean raster imagery reveals that IDPDD index is much sensitive to other crop which has highest standard deviations in sigma(vh)degrees and sigma(vv)degrees bands throughout the period, and high R-2 with sigma(vh)degrees (0.70), VV (0.58), NRPB (0.693), and DPDD (0.697) indices. In contrast to this, IDPDD index has least correlation (< 0.289) with sigma(vh)degrees , sigma(vv)degrees, EVI 2, NRPB, and DPDD indices for water body which has smooth surface and lowest SAR backscattering with minimum standard deviations in the same period.

AB  - Remote Sensing data, either airborne or satellites, are very much useful for incorporating the Geographical Information System (GIS) technology. SAR sensors are good as compared to optical sensors for monitoring maritime activity due to their capability of penetrating clouds and can work without depending upon any weather condition. SAR sensors can work day and night while optical sensors need a source to illuminate the surface hence can only work in the daytime. Many studies have been done on UAV SAR sensors for different applications like oil spills, ship detection, etc. Moreover, the polarimetric technique helps in understanding the feature much more in detail by using phase information like orientation and shape of the object using scattering behavior. In this paper, the main focus of the study is the Automatic ship detection using the Adaptive Threshold Algorithm popularly known as Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) for polarimetric UAV SAR data. Coherency Matrix (T-3) is computed from quad-pol covariance SAR data C-3 and CFAR algorithm is applied to each element of the coherency matrix to detect ships. The sea surface follows the surface scattering and this can be highly helpful to distinguish the ships from the sea background. Moreover, due to the homogeneous background of imagery, the CFAR algorithm works more precisely as it can compute the adaptive threshold for each pixel using the background area by assuming it to the Gaussian in nature. Moreover, the Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database (GSHHG) vector coastline layer and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are used for masking out the land area to enhance the area of interest. In this study, T-22 element of the scattering matrix shows better results in the detection of the ships and in determining the shape of the ships. Finally, the efficiency of the algorithm is measured using the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve.

TI  - Development, implementation, and evaluation of a local community-based ophthalmology sentinel surveillance system in a remote rural area in Japan
T2  - RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Solid and sensitive infectious disease surveillance systems need to be developed and implemented to prevent and control epidemics. Although statutory national infectious disease surveillance systems have been developed in many countries, some challenges remain, such as their limited timeliness, representativeness, and sensitivity, as well as the fact that they cannot capture all local outbreaks that occur in small communities. To overcome these limitations, local community-based infectious disease surveillance systems that meet local needs and can operate with constrained resources need to be developed, especially in remote and rural low-resource areas. This study aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate a voluntary and unique local community-based ophthalmology sentinel surveillance system in Isa city (OSSS-Isa), a remote rural area in Japan. Methods: For the development of OSSS-Isa, one hospital in Isa city assumed a leading role and developed a network with all medical institutions - 20 hospitals and clinics in the local community, including two ophthalmology clinics - as sentinel reporting sites. Surveillance was conducted on a weekly basis from Monday to Sunday. The collection, aggregation, and reporting of the surveillance data were implemented promptly on the same day, Monday, using a paper-based form and fax. For the evaluation of OSSS-Isa, the study followed the updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to select the evaluation criteria and develop a questionnaire. The questionnaires were then distributed to 20 hospitals and clinics, with the responses evaluated on a five-point Likert scale. Results: For the implementation of OSSS-Isa, the system issued alerts twice to the networked hospitals and clinics when signs of an increase in the prevalence of a target infectious eye disease appeared in Isa city. After the alerts, the number of cases decreased in the community. Regarding the evaluation survey, physicians from 18 hospitals and clinics responded to the questionnaire (response rate 90%). In contrast to flexibility, more than 75% of the respondents gave high ratings to simplicity, data quality, acceptability, timeliness, and stability in evaluating OSSS-Isa, with the mean score for these evaluation criteria higher than 3.67. Conclusion: The present results indicate that OSSS-Isa has high simplicity, data quality, acceptability, timeliness, and stability, which is highly embedded with the local healthcare providers in Isa city. OSSS-Isa contributed to the early and accurate detection of signs of infectious eye disease outbreaks emerging in a small remote rural local community. The success factors seem to include its simple well-designed implementation methods, good external factors, and active human factors suited to the characteristics of the small remote rural community. The OSSS-Isa initiative appears to be a meaningful practical example of successful health advocacy by healthcare providers by developing a system at the local social level while going beyond the boundaries of routine medical practice. If voluntary small-scale surveillance systems can complement statutory large-scale ones and work together locally, nationally, and internationally, it might be possible to detect small, unusual happenings that occur in the community, such as emerging infectious diseases, and thereby help avert global outbreaks.

TI  - Humanity, Nature, and the Supernatural in Washington Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AMERICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the ways through which Washington Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" might be considered as an example of environmental literature which focuses extensively on nature and the human relationship to it. It argues that Irving promotes an ecocentric worldview which treats human beings as members rather than masters of the natural environment. It suggests that this worldview is articulated in various ways in the tale such as the emphasis on the intrinsic value of nature, the celebration of biodiversity, and the condemnation of the anthropocentric outlook on the natural world. In its study of Irving's representation of the natural environment, the essay claims that nature is portrayed as a character that is not only omnipresent but also more powerful than human beings and their attempts to dominate and subdue it. It asserts that the supernatural in the tale is only nature's reaction to human greed and egotism. Due to the presence of many important environmental values and ethics, the paper argues that the story reflects Irving's ecological awareness and underlines his significant contribution to the development of environmental literature.

TI  - Investigating the Capabilities of Various Multispectral Remote Sensors Data to Map Mineral Prospectivity Based on Random Forest Predictive Model: A Case Study for Gold Deposits in Hamissana Area, NE Sudan
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data provide significant information about surface geological features, but they have not been fully investigated as a tool for delineating mineral prospective targets using the latest advancements in machine learning predictive modeling. In this study, besides available geological data (lithology, structure, lineaments), Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and ASTER multispectral remote sensing data were processed to produce various predictor maps, which then formed four distinct datasets (namely Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, ASTER, and Data-integration). Remote sensing enhancement techniques, including band ratio (BR), principal component analysis (PCA), and minimum noise fraction (MNF), were applied to produce predictor maps related to hydrothermal alteration zones in Hamissana area, while geological-based predictor maps were derived from applying spatial analysis methods. These four datasets were used independently to train a random forest algorithm (RF), which was then employed to conduct data-driven gold mineral prospectivity modeling (MPM) of the study area and compare the capability of different datasets. The modeling results revealed that ASTER and Sentinel-2 datasets achieved very similar accuracy and outperformed Landsat-8 dataset. Based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC), both datasets had the same prediction accuracy of 0.875. However, ASTER dataset yielded the highest overall classification accuracy of 73%, which is 6% higher than Sentinel-2 and 13% higher than Landsat-8. By using the data-integration concept, the prediction accuracy increased by about 6% (AUC: 0.938) compared with the ASTER dataset. Hence, these results suggest that the framework of exploiting remote sensing data is promising and should be used as an alternative technique for MPM in case of data availability issues.

TI  - Reconstructing NDVI and land surface temperature for cloud cover pixels of Landsat-8 images for assessing vegetation health index in the Northeast region of Thailand
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Critical applications of satellite data products include monitoring vegetation dynamics and assessing vegetation health conditions. Some indicators like normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) are used to assess the status of vegetation growth and health. But one of the major problems with passive remote sensing satellite data products is cloud and shadow cover that leads to data gaps in the images. The present study proposes temporal aggregation of images over a short time span and developing short span harmonic analysis of time series (SS-HANTS) and pixel-wise multiple linear regression (PMLR) algorithms for retrieving cloud contaminated NDVI and LST information from Landsat-8 (L8) data products, respectively. The developed algorithms were applied in the northeastern part of Thailand to recover the missing NDVI and LST values from time series L8 images acquired in 2018. The predicted NDVI and LST values at artificially clouded locations were compared with the corresponding clear pixel values. Additionally, the model predicted LST and NDVI values were also compared with MODIS LST and NDVI datasets. The calculated root mean square (RMSE) values were ranging from 0.03 to 0.11 and 1.50 to 2.98 & DEG;C for NDVI and LST variables, respectively. The validation statistics show that these models can be satisfactorily applied to retrieve NDVI and LST values from cloud-contaminated pixels of L8 images. Furthermore, a vegetation health index (VHI) computed from cloud retrieved continuous NDVI and LST images at province level shows that most of the western provinces have healthy vegetation condition than other provinces in the northeast of Thailand.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Climatic variability causes loss of biodiversity in high-elevation ecosystems. Monitoring of biodiversity along the temperature-sensitive treeline ecotone in the Himalaya is necessary. The applications of information theory in understanding the patterns of biodiversity along the alpine treeline ecotone in the Himalaya are highlighted in the chapter. Spatially explicit monitoring of plant biodiversity using satellite remote sensing imagery and information theory was conducted. alpha-and beta-diversity were estimated using high-resolution imagery of the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard the Sentinel-2A satellite. The relationship between topography and biodiversity along the treeline ecotone in the Eastern Himalaya was studied. There was a statistically significant (p < 0.001) difference in the spectral Shannon's entropy along the gradients of elevation, slope, and summits' aspects. The highest biodiversity (Shannon's entropy, 3.04) was observed in the 4000 to 4500 m elevation range. The chapter concludes with the limitations and prospects of remote sensing biodiversity along the treeline ecotone in the Himalaya from space.

TI  - Analyzing Wetland Dynamics Using Geospatial Techniques: A Case of Abay Choman and Jimma Geneti Watershed, Horo Guduru Wollega Zone, Western Ethiopia
T2  - AIR SOIL AND WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland ecosystems are one of the most important areas that provides different ecosystems services as well as habitat for plant and animal species. In spite of multipurpose, wetland ecosystems are under threats. This study attempts to analyze wetland dynamics of Abay Choman and Jimma Geneti watershed in Horo Guduru Wollega Zone, Western Ethiopia using geospatial techniques. The land use land cover (LULC), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were investigated using Landsat 5 TM of 1991, Landsat 7ETM+ of 2003, and OLI/TIRS of 2021. In the present study, the LULC was classified using a supervised classification method with maximum likelihood algorithm. The red and infrared bands of Landsat imagery from three different time periods were used to calculate NDVI, while the NDWI was estimated using the green and near infrared (NIR) bands of multispectral Landsat images. Results show that wetland ecosystem in the study area decreased by about 125.2 km(2) (8.8%) with the rate of 4.2 km(2)/year. In contrast, agricultural land increased by 223.4 km(2) with the rate of 7.4 km(2)/year between 1991 and 2021. About 66.7 km(2) wetland was converted to cultivated land whereas 29.3 and 24.7 km(2) of grassland and shrubs land were converted into cultivated land. As a result, the maximum NDVI and NDWI values were decreased between 1991 and 2021. To minimize the rapid loss of wetland and water bodies in the study area, proper land use planning and environmental education should be promoted.

TI  - Evaluation of the Precision of SARAL/AltiKa and Sentinel-3A Satellite Altimetry Data Over the Vietnam Sea and Its Surroundings
T2  - ADVANCES IN GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGY IN MINING AND EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Geospatial Technologies and Earth Resources (GTER)
CL  - Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Hanoi, VIETNAM
AB  - Satellite altimetry has proven to be a useful tool to measure sea surface height, which is of diverse applications in oceanography, geodesy, among others. However, the precision of satellite altimetry data is different between missions and areas. This article evaluates the precision of observed data received by two satellite altimeters of SARAL/AltiKa and Sentinel-3A in the Exact Repeat Mission mode over the Vietnam Sea and its surroundings. The precision of the data is assessed based on height differences at intersection points between ascending and descending tracks. First, the positions of each intersection point between the ascending and descending tracks are interpolated from measure points with the second-order polynomial model. Then, the standard deviation of the height difference is estimated from all intersection points for each of 34 repeat cycles (SARAL/AltiKa) and 28 repeat cycles (Sentinel-3A) over the study area. The results show that the standard deviations of the SARAL/AltiKa data are between +/- 4.5 cm and +/- 7.5 cm, with an average of +/- 5.9 cm, while those of Sentinel-3A range from +/- 4.4 cm to +/- 7.7 cm, with an average of +/- 5.9 cm. Of both datasets, the height differences are greater at points located close to the coastlines and islands.

TI  - Overcast sky condition prevails on and influences the biometeorology of the tropical Andean Paramos
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds play a major role in modulating the biometeorological processes. We studied the influence of cloudiness on four biometeorological variables: daily air temperature (T-air), relative humidity (RH), reference evapotranspiration (ETr), and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), recorded at four sites of Andean Paramos in southern Ecuador during 2.5 to 5.5 years. First, we quantified both the cloud cover percentage (Cloud%) creating cloud masks over the visible bands of Landsat 7 images and the sky condition (K-T) using the records of solar and extraterrestrial radiation. Second, we estimated K-T from Cloud%. Finally, we quantified T-air, RH, ETr, and PAR under clear, cloudy, and overcast K-T and their dependence on K-T. The average Cloud% ranged between 6596-76%, and K-T corroborated the prevailing overcast sky (between 55% and 72.5% of the days) over the paramos. The proposed model performed well in the sites of calibration (R-2 = 0.80; MBE = 0.00; RMSE = 0.05) and validation (R-2 = 0.74; MBE = -0.07; RMSE = 0.11). The overcast sky diminished T-air (<= 10 degrees C), ETr (<= 1.6 mm day(-1)), and PAR (4 MJ m(-2) day(-1)) and increased RH (>= 88%), while the variables showed the opposite behavior during the uncommon clear sky (<= 5.5% of the days). Thus, mostly the dynamic of RH (R-2 >= 0.62), ETr (R-2 >= 0.85), and PAR (R-2 >= 0.77) depended on K-T. Hence, the prevailing overcast sky influenced the biometeorology of the paramos.

TI  - Planting Rice at Monsoon Onset Could Mitigate the Impact of Temperature Stress on Rice-Wheat Systems of Bihar, India
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The rice-wheat rotation is the dominant cropping system in Bihar, where food security of the rural population depends heavily on the production of rice and wheat. In Bihar, farmers plant rice after the first significant rains, and climatic shocks induced by low temperatures and terminal heat stress at the end of the corresponding season can significantly affect rice and wheat yields. The present work evaluates the benefit of using an earlier date for planting rice, following the monsoon onset, in reducing thermal stress on rice-wheat systems. High-resolution gridded crop simulations using the APSIM model were performed to simulate potential yields using the monsoon onset and the farmers' practice as planting dates. The monsoon onset was calculated using an agronomic definition, and farmers' practice dates were estimated using satellite data. The results were analyzed in terms of planting dates, yields, and the incidence of temperature stress on rice and wheat by means of the APSIM yields limiting factors. The results show that the rice planting and harvest dates using the monsoon onset are, in general, 20-30 days earlier, which translates into higher and more stable potential yields, which can be up to 50% higher in wheat and 29% in rice. The incidence of thermal stress can be, on average, 12% lower in rice and 25% in wheat. These results can help design mitigation strategies for the impacts of temperature-induced shock events in the context of the advances in sub-seasonal and seasonal forecasting, targeting climate services for farmers in Bihar.

T2  - SYNESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hoping the world would be a better, safer, freer, and more civilised and developed place to live in, I've coined the following concept or term in the science world. The word "transidentity ", for the first time, came to my mind while writing my PH.D thesis on teacher Identity, Belief, and Value (2017). As I surfed and pursued the books, papers, and internet, I couldn't have found any paper, material, and issue on it. All I had found were on Identity, Sub-Categories of Identity, Transnational Identity, somehow about Cross-Identity, and nothing more. That was why it sparked my mind to challenge and change the worldview of the ELT identity and take a leap in the dark to go beyond the borders, territories, and limitations of just Identity.

TI  - Improved Yield Prediction of Winter Wheat Using a Novel Two-Dimensional Deep Regression Neural Network Trained via Remote Sensing
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the use of remotely sensed and on-ground observations of crop fields, in conjunction with machine learning techniques, has led to highly accurate crop yield estimations. In this work, we propose to further improve the yield prediction task by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) given their unique ability to exploit the spatial information of small regions of the field. We present a novel CNN architecture called Hyper3DNetReg that takes in a multi-channel input raster and, unlike previous approaches, outputs a two-dimensional raster, where each output pixel represents the predicted yield value of the corresponding input pixel. Our proposed method then generates a yield prediction map by aggregating the overlapping yield prediction patches obtained throughout the field. Our data consist of a set of eight rasterized remotely-sensed features: nitrogen rate applied, precipitation, slope, elevation, topographic position index (TPI), aspect, and two radar backscatter coefficients acquired from the Sentinel-1 satellites. We use data collected during the early stage of the winter wheat growing season (March) to predict yield values during the harvest season (August). We present leave-one-out cross-validation experiments for rain-fed winter wheat over four fields and show that our proposed methodology produces better predictions than five compared methods, including Bayesian multiple linear regression, standard multiple linear regression, random forest, an ensemble of feedforward networks using AdaBoost, a stacked autoencoder, and two other CNN architectures.

TI  - Neural Network Emulation of Synthetic Hyperspectral Sentinel-2-Like Imagery With Uncertainty
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral satellite imagery provides highly resolved spectral information for large areas and can provide vital information. However, only a few imaging spectrometer missions are currently in operation. Aiming to generate synthetic satellite-based hyperspectral imagery potentially covering any region, we explored the possibility of applying statistical learning, i.e., emulation. Based on the relationship of a Sentinel-2 (S2) scene and a hyperspectral HyPlant airborne image, this work demonstrates the possibility to emulate a hyperspectral S2-like image. We tested the role of different machine learning regression algorithms and varied the image-extracted training dataset size. We found superior performance of neural network as opposed to the other algorithms when trained with large datasets (up to 100 000 samples). The developed emulator was then applied to the L2A (bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance) S2 subset, and the obtained S2-like hyperspectral reflectance scene was evaluated. The validation of emulated against reference spectra demonstrated the potential of the technique. R-2 values between 0.75 and 0.9 and NRMSE between 2 and 5% across the full 402-2356 nm range were obtained. Moreover, epistemic uncertainty is obtained using the dropout technique, revealing spatial fidelity of the emulated scene. We obtained highest SD values of 0.05 (CV of 8%) in clouds and values below 0.01 (CV of 7%) in vegetation land covers. Finally, the emulator was applied to an entire S2 tile (5490 x 5490 pixels) to generate a hyperspectral reflectance datacube with the texture of S2 (60 Gb, at a speed of 0.14 s/10000 pixels). As the emulator can convert any S2 tile into a hyperspectral image, such scenes give perspectives how future satellite imaging spectroscopy will look like.

TI  - Baseline Inappropriate Antibiotic Use in Primary Care Patients with Viral Respiratory Tract Infections with 2019 and 2020.
T2  - Annals of family medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Context: Respiratory tract infection (RTI) is the leading cause of avoidable antimicrobial use in primary care. How the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted antibiotic prescribing practices across Canada is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine rates of antibiotic prescribing for RTI in primary care during the first year of the pandemic (2020), compared to baseline in 2019. Study Design and Analysis: Cross sectional study. Dataset: Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network electronic medical record data from sites in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Population Studied: Patients that met the case definition criteria for an RTI or a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) in 2019, and in 2020. Outcome measures: We examined oral antibiotic prescribing for patients who were identified as having a primary care visit for RTI. The same analysis was repeated for urinary tract infection (UTI) as a tracer condition. The antibiotic use considered avoidable for RTI was defined by Choosing Wisely Canada. Results: A total of 1,692,876 patients with a valid birth year and sex and at least one visit to primary care in 2019 and 2020 were included. Patient visits for RTI decreased from 2.3% in 2019 to 1.6% in 2020 (p<.0001), as did patient visits for UTI (1.1% vs 0.7%, p<.0001). In 2019, 28.0% of patients visits for RTI were prescribed an antibiotic, and this proportion decreased significantly to 20.6% in 2020 (<.0001). The drop in antibiotic prescriptions for RTI was driven by a decrease in prescribing for common cold (13.6% vs. 11.3%, <.0001) and for acute bronchitis/asthma (15.2% vs. 7.3%, p<.0001). In comparison, antibiotic prescribing for visits related to UTI increased marginally between 2019 and 2020 (71.6% vs. 72.3%, p=0.007). Conclusions: A significant decrease in antibiotic prescribing for RTI across primary care was observed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, likely related to the changes in epidemiology and care delivery models in primary care. CPCSSN can provide pan-Canadian surveillance of antibiotic prescribing practices in primary care that can be used for provider feedback and quality improvement.

AB  - These tools were created to test map-scale hypotheses about trends in large remotely sensed data sets but any data with spatial and temporal variation can be analyzed. Tests are conducted using the PARTS method for analyzing spatially autocorrelated time series (Ives et al., 2021: ). The method's unique approach can handle extremely large data sets that other spatiotemporal models cannot, while still appropriately accounting for spatial and temporal autocorrelation. This is done by partitioning the data into smaller chunks, analyzing chunks separately and then combining the separate analyses into a single, correlated test of the map-scale hypotheses.

TI  - YMYW - Your Maps Your Way with Google Earth Engine
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Your Maps Your Way (YMYW) Background YMYW is an interactive Google Earth Engine application. It is designed to allow users with only basic knowledge of satellite imagery and supervised learning techniques to create detailed habitat/land cover maps anywhere in the world with a thematic structure chosen by the user - Your Maps, Your Way. The current version of YMYW allows the classification of optical Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery, but advanced users will find it straightforward to adapt the code to other available image collections. The development of YMYW began during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021). It allowed us to engage and collaborate with local ecologists in South America (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile) to create customised habitat maps for pollination modelling and analysis. Throughout the development of YMYW, our goal was to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface to facilitate collaboration, support local experts and promote knowledge exchange between groups. When using YMYW, users can harness the computing power of Google's Earth Engine and integrate essential local knowledge to create high-quality land cover maps. How to cite this material Morton, R.D., and Schmucki, R. (2023). YMYW - Your Maps Your Way with Google Earth Engine (Version 1.0.0) [Computer software].https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7624622 In a Nutshell - Before you start with YMYW, you must Sign Up and get access to Google's Earth Engine (GEE). - In GEE, you can paste the JavaScript of YMYWinto a new file in the GEE editor. Your Maps Your Way in 10 steps Draw the Area of Interest (AOI), name the newly created geometry "aoi', and press the "Run" button. Select the collection of satellite images to be classified (Sentinel-2 or Landsat). Define the year and the time periods (dates and months) that capture the land cover changes and phenology in the region of interest. Press the "Show composites" button to visualise the composite images; adjust cloud tolerance and time period as needed. Digitise training objects for specific land cover classes, using composite layers, the Google satellite layer, or other sources of information. To improve cross-validation, aim to draw many small training objects distributed across the AOI. Press the "Classify" button to run a random forest classifier to classify each pixel of the Area of Interest (AOI). Press the "Validate classification" button to cross-Validate the classification and evaluate its accuracy. Digitise additional training objects for misclassified land covers and areas. Repeat steps 6 to 8 until a satisfactory classification is achieved (go back to step 3 if necessary). Press the "Export classification and more" button to export the results: the land cover map, the training dataset, and the validation dataset. Export appears under the "Task" tab. Press "RUN" and fill in the export details to initiate the specific export. See the sequence of screenshots. Classification with YMYW is a heuristic, iterative process. At each iteration, training objects can be added and/or removed until the classification converges to an optimal result. The training objects are digitised using online image collections as base maps and the user's local knowledge of the area of interest. YMYW uses a supervised machine learning algorithm (Random Forests) that "learns and improves" mainly when its supervisor identifies where it makes mistakes (misclassification).

AB  - Your Maps Your Way (YMYW) Background YMYW is an interactive Google Earth Engine application. It is designed to allow users with only basic knowledge of satellite imagery and supervised learning techniques to create detailed habitat/land cover maps anywhere in the world with a thematic structure chosen by the user - Your Maps, Your Way. The current version of YMYW allows the classification of optical Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery, but advanced users will find it straightforward to adapt the code to other available image collections. The development of YMYW began during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021). It allowed us to engage and collaborate with local ecologists in South America (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile) to create customised habitat maps for pollination modelling and analysis. Throughout the development of YMYW, our goal was to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface to facilitate collaboration, support local experts and promote knowledge exchange between groups. When using YMYW, users can harness the computing power of Google's Earth Engine and integrate essential local knowledge to create high-quality land cover maps. How to cite this material Morton, R.D., and Schmucki, R. (2023). YMYW - Your Maps Your Way with Google Earth Engine (Version 1.0.0) [Computer software].https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7624622 In a Nutshell - Before you start with YMYW, you must Sign Up and get access to Google's Earth Engine (GEE). - In GEE, you can paste the JavaScript of YMYWinto a new file in the GEE editor. Your Maps Your Way in 10 steps Draw the Area of Interest (AOI), name the newly created geometry "aoi', and press the "Run" button. Select the collection of satellite images to be classified (Sentinel-2 or Landsat). Define the year and the time periods (dates and months) that capture the land cover changes and phenology in the region of interest. Press the "Show composites" button to visualise the composite images; adjust cloud tolerance and time period as needed. Digitise training objects for specific land cover classes, using composite layers, the Google satellite layer, or other sources of information. To improve cross-validation, aim to draw many small training objects distributed across the AOI. Press the "Classify" button to run a random forest classifier to classify each pixel of the Area of Interest (AOI). Press the "Validate classification" button to cross-Validate the classification and evaluate its accuracy. Digitise additional training objects for misclassified land covers and areas. Repeat steps 6 to 8 until a satisfactory classification is achieved (go back to step 3 if necessary). Press the "Export classification and more" button to export the results: the land cover map, the training dataset, and the validation dataset. Export appears under the "Task" tab. Press "RUN" and fill in the export details to initiate the specific export. See the sequence of screenshots. Classification with YMYW is a heuristic, iterative process. At each iteration, training objects can be added and/or removed until the classification converges to an optimal result. The training objects are digitised using online image collections as base maps and the user's local knowledge of the area of interest. YMYW uses a supervised machine learning algorithm (Random Forests) that "learns and improves" mainly when its supervisor identifies where it makes mistakes (misclassification). In most cases, and with some practice, YMYW will produce a high-quality land cover/habitat map in a few iterations. YMYW allows the user to select and define the thematic structure of the classification used for land cover mapping.

TI  - A Spatio-Temporal Neural Network Learning System for City-Scale Carbon Storage Capacity Estimating
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon storage capacity can be estimated to establish evaluation standards and statistics for carbon neutrality. Existing estimation methods including machine learning system have weakness modeling ability, and they are unable to deal with the complex topographies and temporal changes in vegetation in urban zones. However, a deep neural network has the potential ability to face such complex scenes because of its nonlinear fitting properties which has been widely used in industry. In this study, a novel and powerful neural network learning system named CiSL-NPP is proposed, to integrate multi-source data as an accurate, efficient, simple, long-term, city-scale carbon storage capacity measurement method. We use an unsupervised generation model spatio-temporal Masked AutoEncoder (st-MAE) and lightweight RNN model to efficiently obtain high-quality data that contain time-series information such as seasons; this minimizes any undue impact of meteorological, temporal, and spatial factors on the measurement owing to the multi-source, multi-modal nature of the data. In the MAE, we add seasonal coding to make it time-series sensitive; we also embed road network information to accurately perceive the complex topography of the city. Results for 16 cities in China and Europe revealed that the proposed method shows: 1) Higher-quality generated data (MSE is 0.13-0.29); 2) Accurate coverage of time series and complex geographical features; 3) Satisfaction of estimation demands with only 316 RMB cost; 4) Capability to evolve a long-term trend of urban vegetation carbon storage capacity in 4.2 days; and 5) Easily interpretable results which could, in practice, provide sound guidance for urban planning and decision-making processes.

TI  - Optimization of Cross Correlation Algorithm for Annual Mapping of Alpine Glacier Flow Velocities; Application to Sentinel-2
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, satellite observations cover most of the Earth's surface in a repetitive manner. This information is crucial for documenting variability and environmental changes such as glacier surface velocity. With this in mind, digital image processing has been developed and improved over the past decades. The processing challenges are now related to optimizing parameters that account for the high variability of natural processes, as well as filtering and aggregating the results to provide useful products to end-users. Based on the normalized cross correlation (NCC) method applied to Sentinel-2 optical satellite observations up to 400 days apart, we present a series of tests to derive optimal parameter values for the quantification of alpine glacier ice velocity that we have applied to the Mont-Blanc massif where in situ measurements are available. We found that a search distance adapted to the temporal baseline, a 16x16 pixel window size, and a 5x5 pixels sampling provide an appropriate combination of parameters to process Sentinel-2 with the NCC method when applied to small alpine glaciers. Combining several spatial and temporal filters applied to a large set of more than 18 000 displacement maps obtained between 2015 and 2021, then aggregating these filtered maps using statistical or linear regressions into annual maps, yields near-complete maps of the test region with a root mean square error (RMSE) reduced to about 10 m.yr(-1) compared to in situ measurements.

T2  - AIMS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the spatiotemporal characterization of droughts is a key step in the design and implementation of practical measures to mitigate their impacts, it is hampered by the lack of hydro -climatic data with sufficient spatial density and duration. This study aimed to assess the trends and spatial patterns of drought occurrence in the Ouergha catchment in northern Morocco, which has been identified as a hot spot for climate change and variability. The study combined data from various sources, including the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOi); Western Mediterranean Oscillation Index (WeMOi); a meteorological index (SPI), calculated using precipitation data; a hydrological index (SDI), calculated using precipitation data; and satellite images to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) from 1984/85 to 2016/17. The results showed that the adopted statistical analyses were effective in detecting the linearity and trend of drought in the Ouergha catchment scale. The correlations between various indices were moderate to strong between NAOi and SPI, WeMoi and SPI, as well as SPI and SDI, while the Mann-Kendall tests indicate an increasing trend of drought intensity in the catchment. During dry events, vegetation cover and moisture were maintained due to the presence of dam reserves. Overall, the study provides empirical evidence that confirms the severe drought conditions experienced in the Ouergha catchment. The unique set of data adds to the growing body of knowledge about drought in the region and underscores the urgency of preserving dam resources for sustainable use during future droughts.

CP  - IEEE 15th International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ISADS)
CL  - Univ Panamericana, Mexico City, MEXICO
AB  - In this paper, an automatic segmentation approach of the Viedma glacier terminus is proposed. The method uses multi-spectral images from the Landsat-5 satellite to determine the area of the glacier through computer vision techniques. The area of the glacier is estimated, and a linear model is fitted, obtaining a correlation of 0.968 between the measured area and a fit linear regression model. On the other hand, a bio-inspired optical flow estimation approach is used to calculate and visualize the displacement of the glacier through time. In addition, an analysis is performed between the temperature variation in the Southern Cone and the decrease of the glacier in the function of time. A linear trend (r(2) = 0.95) shows that the analyzed area of the glacier has decreased by about 1.9% annually in the observation season. It reveals an inverse relationship between the change in the size of the glacier and global warming, showing that if the same conditions remain, the glacier's zone analyzed in this work would be close to its disappearance in around 70 years, the time lapse in which a global temperature increase of 1.24 degrees C would be reached.

TI  - Benzene Exposure and MicroRNAs Expression: In Vitro, In Vivo and Human Findings.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression and define part of the epigenetic signature. Their influence on human health is established and interest in them is progressively increasing. Environmental and occupational risk factors affecting human health include chemical agents. Benzene represents a pollutant of concern due to its ubiquity and because it may alter gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms, including miRNA expression changes. This review summarizes recent findings on miRNAs associated with benzene exposure considering in vivo, in vitro and human findings in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms through which benzene induces toxic effects and to evaluate whether selected miRNAs may be used as biomarkers associated with benzene exposure. Original research has been included and the study selection, data extraction and assessments agreed with PRISMA criteria. Both in vitro studies and human results showed a variation in miRNAs' expression after exposure to benzene. In vivo surveys also exhibited this trend, but they cannot be regarded as conclusive because of their small number. However, this review confirms the potential role of miRNAs as "early warning" signals in the biological response induced by exposure to benzene. The importance of identifying miRNAs' expression, which, once validated, might work as sentinel molecules to better understand the extent of the exposure to xenobiotics, is clear. The identification of miRNAs as a molecular signature associated with specific exposure would be advantageous for disease prevention and health promotion in the workplace.

AB  - To solve the problems of limited computing resources and data privacy in the IoE scenario of 6G networks, this paper propose an efficient transmission and secure sharing architecture of sensing data based on federated learning. The architecture considers an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) approach, employs knowledge distillation techniques to compress and accelerate data processing models, and implements data communication technology based on airborne computing aggregation to reduce data transmission delays and improve the efficiency of data communication and computation among nodes. To address the challenge of data sharing for large-scale heterogeneous network nodes in the integrated scenario, this paper adopts a sample expansion technology of distributed remote sensing data based on WGAN-GP to address the issue of insufficient data, and considers blockchain encryption technology to protect data privacy, thus promoting progress in data privacy sharing under distributed ISAC conditions and facilitating the construction of the 6G communication network.

TI  - Soil-Moisture Estimation Based on Multiple-Source Remote-Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture plays a significant role in the global hydrological cycle, which is an important component of soil parameterization. Remote sensing is one of the most important methods used to estimate soil moisture. In this study, we developed a new nonlinear Erf-BP neural network method to establish a soil-moisture-content-estimation model with integrated multiple-resource remote-sensing data from high-resolution, hyperspectral and microwave sensors. Next, we compared the result with the single-resource remote-sensing data for SMC (soil-moisture content) estimation models by using the linear-fitting method. The results showed that the soil-moisture estimation model offers better accuracy by using multiple-resource remote-sensing data. Furthermore, the SMC predicted the results by using the new Erf-BP neural network with multiple-resource remote-sensing data and a good overall correlation coefficient of 0.6838. Compared with the linear model's estimation results, the accuracy of the SMC estimation using the Erf-BP method was increased, and the RMSE decreased from 0.017 g/g to 0.0146 g/g, a decrease of 16.44%. These results also indicate that the improved algorithm of the Erf-BP artificial neural network has better fitting results and precision. This research provides a reference for multiple-resource remote-sensing data for soil-moisture estimation.

TI  - Land use and land cover changes and their impact on ecosystem service values in the north-eastern highlands of Ethiopia.
T2  - PloS one
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The land use and land cover (LULC) changes driven by the growing demands of mankind have a considerable effect on ecosystem services and functions. The study was carried out in the north-eastern highlands of Ethiopia to (1) analyze the effect of LULC changes between 1984 and 2021 and (2) assess the spatiotemporal variations in ecosystem service values (ESVs) and elasticity in response to LULC changes. Using Landsat imageries from 1984 to 2021, the spatiotemporal changes in LULC were evaluated with supervised image classification using maximum likelihood algorithm in ArcGIS software. Six LULC types were subsequently categorized, with overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients above 87% and 0.87, respectively. The ESVs were then estimated based on the Benefit Value Transfer (BVT) approach employing modified conservative value coefficients. The findings revealed a significant increase in cultivated land (9759.1ha) and built-up area (10174.41ha) during the stipulated periods and a drop in other land use types. The forest loss gradually decreased from 4.1% in the second period (1991-2001) to 0.58% in the third (2001-2021), compared to the first of the 1.1% conversion rates. Similarly, the proportion of grassland and water bodies steadily reduced over the stipulated periods, by 1.15% and 2.3% per annum, respectively. The overall loss of ESVs in the study landscape was estimated to be 54.4 million US$ (67.3%), drastically decreasing from 80.3 million US$ in 1984 to 26.4 million US$ in 2021, driven by the declining area coverage of water bodies, grassland, and forestland. Regardless of the loss, the ecosystem functions of hydrological regulation (37.2, 35.0, 6.1, and 5.1 US$ ha-1yr-1), water supply (14.5, 13.6, 2.4, and 2 US$ ha-1yr-1), and food production (9.8, 10.0, 9.1, and 9.9 US$ ha-1yr-1) contributed the most to the total ESV of each year while disturbance regulation and cultural values were the least throughout the study periods. The coefficient of sensitivity (CS) analysis revealed that our estimates were relatively robust. The findings further showed that human-dominated land-uses at the expense of natural ecosystems are the primary drivers of LULC transitions and the ensuing loss of ecosystem services in the region. Thus, this calls for intensive work on more effective land use policies that encourage an integrated management approach, with a focus on safeguarding the sustainability of natural ecosystems.

TI  - Deep Neural Network Regression for Normalized Digital Surface Model Generation With Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent history, normalized digital surface models (nDSMs) have been constantly gaining importance as a means to solve large-scale geographic problems. High-resolution surface models are precious, as they can provide detailed information for a specific area. However, measurements with a high resolution are time consuming and costly. Only a few approaches exist to create high-resolution nDSMs for extensive areas. This article explores approaches to extract high-resolution nDSMs from low-resolution Sentinel-2 data, allowing us to derive large-scale models. We thereby utilize the advantages of Sentinel 2 being open access, having global coverage, and providing steady updates through a high repetition rate. Several deep learning models are trained to overcome the gap in producing high-resolution surface maps from low-resolution input data. With U-Net as a base architecture, we extend the capabilities of our model by integrating tailored multiscale encoders with differently sized kernels in the convolution as well as conformed self-attention inside the skip connection gates. Using pixelwise regression, our U-Net base models can achieve a mean height error of approximately 2 m. Moreover, through our enhancements to the model architecture, we reduce the model error by more than 7%.

TI  - Provider-identified barriers to performance at seven Nigerian accident & emergency units: A cross-sectional study.
T2  - PLOS global public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nigeria hosts much of Africa's morbidity and mortality from emergency medical conditions. We surveyed providers at seven Nigerian Accident & Emergency (A&E) units about (i) their unit's ability to manage six major types of emergency medical condition (sentinel conditions) and (ii) barriers to performing key functions (signal functions) to manage sentinel conditions. Here, we present our analysis of provider-reported barriers to signal function performance.METHODS: 503 Health Providers at 7 A&E units, across 7 states, were surveyed using a modified African Federation of Emergency Medicine (AFEM) Emergency Care Assessment Tool (ECAT). Providers indicating suboptimal performance ascribed this performance to any of eight multiple-choice barriers [infrastructural issues, absent and broken equipment, inadequate training, inadequate personnel, requirement of out-of-pocket payment, non-indication of that signal function for the sentinel condition, and hospital-specific policies barring signal function performance] or an open-ended "other" response. The average number of endorsements for each barrier was obtained for each sentinel condition. Differences in barrier endorsement were compared across site, barrier type and sentinel condition using a three-way ANOVA test. Open-ended responses were evaluated using inductive thematic analysis. Sentinel conditions were Shock, Respiratory Failure, Altered Mental Status, Pain, Trauma, and Maternal & Child Health. Study sites were the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, the Federal Medical Center, Katsina, the National Hospital Abuja, the Federal Teaching Hospital Gombe, the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (Kwara), and the Federal Medical Center Owerri (Imo).FINDINGS: Barrier distribution varied widely by study site. Just three study sites shared any one barrier to signal function performance as their most common. The two barriers most commonly endorsed were (i) non-indication of, and (ii) insufficient infrastructure to perform signal functions. A three-way ANOVA test found significant differences in barrier endorsement by barrier type, study site and sentinel condition (p<0.05). Thematic analysis of open-ended responses highlighted (i) considerations disfavoring signal function performance and (ii) lack of experience with signal functions as barriers to signal function performance. Interrater reliability, calculated using Fleiss' Kappa, was found to be 0.5 across 11 initial codes and 0.51 for our two final themes.INTERPRETATION: Provider perspective varied with regards to barriers to care. Despite these differences, the trends seen for infrastructure reflect the importance of sustained investment in Nigerian health infrastructure. The high level of endorsement seen for the non-indication barrier may signal need for better ECAT adaptation for local practice & education, and for improved Nigerian emergency medical education and training. A low endorsement was seen for patient-facing costs, despite the high burden of Nigerian private expenditure on healthcare, indicating limited representation of patient-facing barriers. Analysis of open-ended responses was limited by the brevity and ambiguity of these responses on the ECAT. Further investigation is needed towards better representation of patient-facing barriers and qualitative approaches to evaluating Nigerian emergency care provision.

TI  - Geodesic Distance Based Scattering Power Decomposition for Compact Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a geodesic distance (GD)-based scattering power decomposition for compact polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired over agricultural landscapes. The proposed technique decomposes the polarized portion of the total backscattered power in proportion to the normalized target similarity measures. The measures are derived from the GDs, which are computed between the Kennaugh matrices of observed and canonical targets (dihedral or trihedral). We observed a pseudo-power component in the double bounce power, which can be attributed to target irregularities. To compensate for the pseudo-power component, we proposed a compensation strategy by utilizing the CP radar vegetation index (CpRVI). The compensation factor assists in readjusting the polarized power components. The proposed approach was tested with real (RADARSAT Constellation Mission: RCM) and simulated (RADARSAT-2: RS2) hybrid CP data over agricultural sites in Canada. The effectiveness of the approach was demonstrated by comparing the decomposed powers with a recently proposed CP scattering power decomposition.

AB  - Teff is one of the main ingredients in everyday food for most Ethiopians, and its production mainly depends on natural conditions of the climate, unpredictable changes in the climate, and other growth factors. Teff production is extremely variable on different occasions and creates complex scenarios for prediction of yield. Traditional methods of prediction are incomplete and require field data collection, which is costly, with the result being poor prediction accuracy. Remotely sensed satellite image data has proven to be a reliable and real-time source of data for crop yield prediction; however, these data are enormous in size and difficult to interpret. Recently, machine-learning methods have been in use for processing satellite data, providing more accurate crop prediction results. However, these approaches are used in croplands covering vast areas or regions, requiring huge amounts of cropland mask data, which is not available in most developing countries, and may not provide accurate household level yield prediction. In this article, we proposed a machine learning based Teff Yield Prediction System for smaller cropland areas using publicly available multispectral satellite images, that represent spectral reflectance information related to the crop growth status collected from different satellites (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2). For this, we have prepared our own satellite image dataset for training. A Convolutional Neural Network was developed and trained to be fit for a regression task. A training loss of 3.3783 and a validation loss of 1.6212 were obtained; in other words, the model prediction accuracy was 98.38%. This shows that our model's performance is very promising.

TI  - A Generic Approach to Parameterize the Turbulent Energy of Single-Epoch Atmospheric Delays From InSAR Time Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The observed phase in time series of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) products is a superposition of various components. Differential topography, line-of-sight displacements, and differential atmospheric delays are the main contributions and need to be disentangled to derive accurate digital elevation model (DEM), deformation, or atmospherical products from InSAR. However, isolating the atmospheric component has been proven difficult as it is spatiotemporally highly dynamic and a superposition of two atmospheric states. Here, we propose an approach to parameterize the stochastic properties of the single-epoch atmospheric delay field as a way to define the atmospheric signal. We found that the atmospheric signal of a time series of interferograms can be characterized by structure functions, which can be used to isolate the single-epoch structure functions. Due to the scaling properties of the atmospheric signal, it is then possible to construct a parametric function per SAR acquisition, using two isotropic and three anisotropic parameters. In particular, the isotropic parameters for the short-distance variation and long-distance variation in atmospheric delay can be used to characterize the atmospheric signal. For a test set of 151 Sentinel-1 acquisitions, this results in an atmospheric energy range of about 10 for short-distance scales and about 50 for long-distance scales. Our parameterization demonstrates that we can describe the spatiotemporal variability of InSAR atmospheric delays, which provides a measure for atmospheric noise for individual epochs in deformation time series based on distance and azimuth.

TI  - Motivating Personal Climate Action through a Safety and Health Risk Management Framework
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is overwhelming evidence the impacts of climate change present a probable threat to personal health and safety. However, traditional risk management approaches have not been applied to ameliorate the crises. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact on personal motivation for action of a communication intervention that framed climate change as a safety issue that can be mitigated through a safety and health risk management framework. Participants' perception of climate change in terms of its anthropogenicity, context and importance, perception as a personal threat, belief in the efficacy of human action, motivating drivers for action, knowledge of climate change impacts, perceived personal barriers to climate action, and short- and long-term preferences for mitigating actions were evaluated. In addition, this study assessed the role of personal worldview on motivation for climate action. Methods: Through an online survey instrument embedded with a communication/education intervention, data were collected from N = 273 participants. Pre and post-intervention responses were assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and descriptive statistics. A path analysis assessed the influence of anthropogenicity, personal impact, and human efficacy beliefs on participant motivation for action. Multi-regression analyses and descriptive statics were used to evaluate the role of worldview on participant motivation for climate action. Results: Personal motivation for action significantly increased post-intervention. Anthropogenicity, personal impact, and human efficacy beliefs were predictive of personal motivation. Those who prioritized climate change as a safety issue and those driven by a desire to protect current and future generations had higher levels of personal motivation, post-intervention. Knowledge of climate change increased, psychosocial factors as barriers to climate action decreased, and preferences for personal mitigating actions shifted towards more impactful choices post-intervention. Holding Egalitarian worldviews significantly predicted climate action motivation. Conclusion: Presenting climate change and climate action strategies via a traditional health and safety risk management context was effective in increasing personal motivation for climate action. This study contributes to the literature on climate change communication and climate action motivation.

TI  - Impact of climate change on the snow-covered area over the transboundary Jhelum River basin of the Himalayas region using Remote Sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is one of the pertinent issues for the 21st century mainly for the transboundary river basins because it has parallel impacts on the hydrosphere and cryosphere. The temperature changes impacted the snow-covered area (SCA) of the river basins. MODIS MOD10A2 product data was used to delineate the SCA for the Jhelum River basin. The catchment is further divided into elevation zones using DEM to delineate the SCA for every zone. The temperature changes were plotted against the SCA, and correlation analysis was used to see the impact of climate change on the SCA. The seasonal trend of SCA has depicted an increase in SCA during the spring and summer seasons and decreasing trend during autumn while winter shows stability. The snow cover depletion curve (SCDC) showed that snow is maximum in December, January, and February while its minimum during July and August. The correlation analysis of temperature and SCA for the period of 2001-2017 illustrated the inverse relationship, which depicted that a slight increase in temperature may trigger the fastest depletion in the snow-covered areas generating water issues for snow/glacier-fed river basins.

TI  - The Use of Random Forest Regression for Estimating Leaf Nitrogen Content of Oil Palm Based on Sentinel 1-A Imagery
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - For obtaining a spatial map of the distribution of nitrogen nutrients from oil palm plantations, a quite complex Leaf Sampling Unit (LSU) is required. In addition, sample analysis in the laboratory is time consuming and quite expensive, especially for large plantation areas. Monitoring the nutrition of oil palm plants can be achieved using remote-sensing technology. The main obstacles of using passive sensors in multispectral imagery are cloud cover and shadow noise. This research used C-SAR Sentinel equipped with active sensors that can overcome cloud barriers. A model to estimate leaf nitrogen nutrient status was constructed using random forest regression (RFR) based on multiple polarization (VV-VH) and local incidence angle (LIA) data on Sentinel-1A imagery. A sample of 1116 LSU data from different islands (i.e., Sumatra, Java, and Kalimantan) was used to develop the proposed estimation model. The performance evaluation of the model obtained the averaged MAPE, correctness, and MSE of 9.68%, 90.32% and 11.03%, respectively. Spatial maps of the distribution of nitrogen values in certain oil palm areas can be produced and visualized on the web so that they can be accessed easily and quickly for various purposes of oil palm management such as fertilization planning, recommendations, and monitoring.

TI  - Monitoring Shoreline Changes along the Southwestern Coast of South Africa from 1937 to 2020 Using Varied Remote Sensing Data and Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline analysis in response to the rapid erosion of sandy beaches has evolved along with geospatial and computer technology; it remains an essential task for sustainable coastal management. This severe and rapid erosion has been reported at several sandy beaches worldwide, including Yzerfontein beaches, on the southwest coast of South Africa. We determined this vulnerability from 1937 to 2020 and predicted its change by 2040 by manually delineating shoreline positions from 1937, 1960, and 1977 from aerial photographs and Landsat products between 1985 and 2020 in an automated fashion using the CoastSat toolkit and Google Earth Engine. We then integrated these datasets to calculate the extent of shoreline dynamics over the past eight decades using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). Our results show that the coastline changed dynamically between 1937 and 2020, culminating in an average net erosion of 38 m, with the most extensive erosion occurring between 2015 and 2020. However, coastal projections indicate a slight change in shoreline position over the next two decades. Further studies should integrate additional high resolution remote sensing data and non-remote sensing data (e.g., field surveys) to improve our results and provide a more thorough understanding of the coastal environment and overcome some of remotely-sensed data underlying uncertainties.

TI  - Handling heterogeneity within castor crop fields through "Individual Sample as Mean" training parameter approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high temporal resolution data has a great opportunity for specific crop mapping. The recent advancement in remote sensing data had a good impact on crop classification and mapping. In this research work, modified possibilistic c-means (MPCM) fuzzy machine learning approach has been applied for castor crop mapping, using sentinel 2A/2B satellite temporal images and local convolution as adaptive modified possibilistic local information c-means (ADMPLICM) algorithm was applied to remove isolated unwanted pixels. In training sample parameter "individual sample as mean" method was used to handle heterogeneity within the castor fields. The class-based sensor independent normalized difference vegetation index (CBSI-NDVI), normalized difference vegetation index (Red-NIR), and modified NDVI were produced, then separability analysis was conducted for the selecting optimum temporal date for castor crop mapping. The heterogeneity effect within the field was studied using variance parameters, and its values were observed low within the castor crop field. While considering the "individual sample as mean" training parameter approach on CBSI-NDVI, the variance of the target was decreased from 0.019 to 0.016. The identified castor field variance was close to the training field based on their high membership values and these fields had low mean membership difference (MMD) value. MMD values of castor training class with other crop classes were very high (0.425 Isabgol, 0.502 - wheat, 0.259 - Fenugreek, 0.809 - Mustard, and 0.569 - Cumin), which indicates other crops were distinguished very well.

AB  - Coastal ecogeomorphological features support remarkable biodiversity and provide a wide variety of ecosystem services: cultural services (recreation, tour-ism facilities), provisioning services (agricultural production, pastoralism), and regulating services, including carbon sequestration and natural protection against coastal erosion and marine flooding. Therefore, mapping these coastal features with very high spatial resolution is a major challenge to their preservation and to face the challenges of global change. In this study, the contribution of the near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) bands from multispectral drone and super-spectral (SS) WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite images was used to map coastal ecogeomorpho-logical features using two supervised classification algorithms: maximum likeli-hood (ML) and support vector machine (SVM). Various combinations of spectral bands, visible + NIR and visible + MIR, evaluated through the overall accuracy (OA) scores, for the classification of ecogeomorphological features revealed the significant contribution of the NIR and MIR bands to the mapping of coastal fea-tures. The addition of the NIR bands to the RGB band combination significantly increased the OA scores of the classifications (by +4.99% and +6.54%, with the ML and SVM algorithms, respectively). The addition of MIR bands to the combination of these bands provides classifications with even higher OAs (up to 99.1% and 98.4%), demonstrating the relevance of MIR bands for the mapping of coastal ecogeomorphological features.

TI  - Vygotskian Resonances With the African Worldview of Ubuntu for Decolonial Deaf Education
T2  - AMERICAN ANNALS OF THE DEAF
M3  - Article
AB  - The African worldview of Ubuntu predates Vygotskian theory, but the Ubuntu view that the community defines the person aligns uncannily with Vygotsky's biosocial proposition and contemporary conceptions of deaf ontology and epistemology. Unlike prevailing Euro-American thought, Ubuntu accentuates the view that it is not any physical or psychological characteristic of the individual that defines personhood. Instead, Ubuntu aphorisms, the containers of meaning in African epistemology, indicate that the reality of the communal world is at least equal if not superior to individual life histories. The author teases out similarities between Vygotskian thought and Ubuntu, illustrating deaf children's development along a different axis, facilitated by a holistic, diversified biosocial process in which neither their deafness nor disability indicates inferiority or coloniality. Grounded on the African principle No language is complete without other languages, the present article contributes to a nascent indigenous theorization of contemporary deaf education.

TI  - Use of remote sensing to determine rainwater harvesting sites for piped micro-irrigation schemes in Chimanimani District, Zimbabwe
T2  - WATER SA
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern highlands of Zimbabwe, particularly Chimanimani District, are endowed with natural water bodies such as springs, pools, wetlands, puddles and river systems, which are potential sources of water for irrigated farming. Despite this, water challenges continue to exist due to rainfall seasonality and lack of suitable water harvesting sites. This calls for solutions to harness water in long-lasting sources to support the piped micro-irrigation schemes. These schemes are pillars in agricultural interventions such as horticulture, livestock farming, fish farming and beekeeping. This study therefore, determined potential rainwater harvesting (RWH) sites in Chimanimani District using geospatial techniques. Water pixels from Landsat 8 images were extracted using the normalised difference moisture index (NDMI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Potential RWH sites were classified into land-based zones, wetlands and natural water bodies. Findings show that land-based zones cover 27.53%, wetlands cover 24.65% and water bodies cover 6.11% of the district. The study also indicates that integrating geographic information systems with remote-sensing tools is a useful approach in identifying RWH sites. Thus, this study provided a spatially explicit approach and presents a suitability map for RWH in Chimanimani District.

TI  - TRANSFORMATION OF CHRISTIAN MOTIFS IN TED HUGHES' POETRY
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes various manifestations of Adam's biblical image in the work of the famous English poet Ted Hughes (1930-1998). Based on a sources review devoted to Hughes' contradictory attitude to the Christian religion, the author of the article makes an assumption about Hughes' gradual chronological transition from early criticism of Protestantism and the Reformation to the mature recognition of Christian symbols as fundamental for spiritual development of the humanity. The transformation of the poet's worldview in some sense can be traced by the biblical image of the progenitor of mankind, Adam, who appears more than once as a character in Hughes' poetic cycles of the 1970s. The analysis of the poems traces the evolution of Adam's image from the object of irony and black humor (in "Crow: From the Life and Songs of the Crow", 1970) to the universal metaphor of spiritual rebirth ("Adam and the Sacred Nine", 1979) and the symbol of overcoming the dichotomy of soul and body ("Wolfwatching", 1989). Adam's place in the author's mythological narrative, which is present in most of the poet's artistic and critical works, is separately indicated. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the poetry collection "Adam and the Sacred Nine", in which the immobility of the main character and the oneiric space where he resides can be compared with the existential feeling of abandonment, and with the state of splitting of human consciousness in the modern world. The pathos of the poetry collection is interpreted as a call to get rid of the "ego" of the material world, phantoms of "false mythology". Using the example of several poems, it is shown how the leitmotivs of the author's myth, appearing within the framework of individual episodes, are embedded in the general narrative structure of T. Hughes, with its movement "from the world of blood to the world of light" (K. Sagar).

TI  - Verification of the Ekman Upwelling Criterion with In Situ Temperature Measurements in the Southeastern Baltic Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Upwelling leads to a sharp and strong decrease in water temperature in the coastal zone of the southeastern Baltic Sea. The quality of existing hydrodynamic models cannot fully meet the requirements of accurate upwelling forecasts. This study provides insight into the applicability of the simplified Ekman upwelling criterion method for the southeastern Baltic Sea. The upwelling criterion is the ratio of the vertical velocity and the duration of the upwelling wind to the mixed layer density. The vertical velocity was determined by the divergence of the integral Ekman transport in the transverse direction. Calculation of the criterion was based on wind data from NCEP/CFSR reanalysis. The upwelling criterion was compared with in situ temperatures from direct measurements near the D-6 oil platform taken in 2015-2017. Only 46% of calculated upwelling cases were confirmed by temperature decreases in the sub-surface. It was found that more than half of the cases of strong temperature decreases were caused by a northern wind (Ekman upwelling), when the criterion exceeded the threshold value. Comparison of the hydrodynamic model results and direct measurements shows that the model's quality is far from perfect, and the simplified methods can be used as alternatives to models. Some recommendations were made for future upwelling research.

TI  - National Scale Land Cover Classification Using the Semiautomatic High-Quality Reference Sample Generation (HRSG) Method and an Adaptive Supervised Classification Scheme
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advent of new high-performance cloud computing platforms [e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)] and freely available satellite data provides a great opportunity for land cover (LC) mapping over large-scale areas. However, the shortage of reliable and sufficient reference samples still hinders large-scale LC classification. Here, selecting Turkey as the case study, we presented a semiautomatic high-quality reference sample generation (HRSG) method using the publicly available scientific LC products and the linear spectral unmixing analysis to generate high-quality ground samples for the years 1995 and 2020 within the GEE platform. Furthermore, we developed an adaptive random forest classification scheme based on Koppen-Geiger climate zone classification system. Our rationale was related to the fact that large-scale study areas often contain multiple climate zones where the spectral signature of the same LC class may vary within different climate zones that can lead to a poor LC classification accuracy. To have a robust assessment, the generated LC maps were evaluated against independent test datasets. In regard to the proposed sample generation method, it was observed that HRSG can generate high-quality samples independent of the characteristics of scientific LC products. The high overall accuracy of 92% for 2020 and 90% for 1995 and satisfactory results for producer's accuracy (ranging between 83.4% and 99.3%) and user's accuracy (ranging between 86.1% and 99.7%) of nine LC classes demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The presented methodologies can be incorporated into future studies related to large-scale LC mapping and LC change monitoring studies.

TI  - Riparian Plant Evapotranspiration and Consumptive Use for Selected Areas of the Little Colorado River Watershed on the Navajo Nation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of riparian vegetation water use are important for hydromorphological assessment, partitioning within human and natural environments, and informing environmental policy decisions. The objectives of this study were to calculate the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) (mm/day and mm/year) and derive riparian vegetation annual consumptive use (CU) in acre-feet (AF) for select riparian areas of the Little Colorado River watershed within the Navajo Nation, in northeastern Arizona, USA. This was accomplished by first estimating the riparian land cover area for trees and shrubs using a 2019 summer scene from National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) (1 m resolution), and then fusing the riparian delineation with Landsat-8 OLI (30-m) to estimate ETa for 2014-2020. We used indirect remote sensing methods based on gridded weather data, Daymet (1 km) and PRISM (4 km), and Landsat measurements of vegetation activity using the two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2). Estimates of potential ET were calculated using Blaney-Criddle. Riparian ETa was quantified using the Nagler ET(EVI2) approach. Using both vector and raster estimates of tree, shrub, and total riparian area, we produced the first CU measurements for this region. Our best estimate of annual CU is 36,983 AF with a range between 31,648-41,585 AF and refines earlier projections of 25,387-46,397 AF.

TI  - Automated Machine Learning Driven Stacked Ensemble Modeling for Forest Aboveground Biomass Prediction Using Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling and large-scale mapping of forest above-ground biomass AGB) is a complicated, challenging, and expensive task. There are considerable variations in forest characteristics that create functional disparity for different models and needs comprehensive evaluation. Moreover, the human-bias involved in the process of modeling and evaluation affects the generalization of models at larger scales. In this article, we present an automated-machine learning framework for modeling, evaluation, and stacking of multiple base models for AGB prediction. We incorporate a hyper-parameter optimization procedure for automatic extraction of targeted features from multitemporal Sentinel-2 data that minimizes human-bias in the proposed modeling pipeline. We integrate the two independent frameworks for automatic feature extraction and automatic model ensembling and evaluation. The results suggest that the extracted target-oriented features have an excessive contribution of red-edge and short-wave infrared spectrum. The feature importance scale indicates a dominant role of summer-based features as compared to other seasons. The automated ensembling and evaluation framework produced a stacked ensemble of base models that outperformed individual base models in accurately predicting forest AGB. The stacked ensemble model delivered the best scores of R-cv(2) = 0.71 and RMSE = 74.44 Mg ha(-1). The other base models delivered R-cv(2) and RMSE ranging between 0.38-0.66 and 81.27-109.44 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The model evaluation metrics indicated that the stacked ensemble model was more resistant to outliers and achieved a better generalization. Thus, the proposed study demonstrated an effective automated modeling pipeline for predicting AGB by minimizing human-bias and deployable over large and diverse forest areas.

TI  - Reducing Biases in Thermal Infrared Surface Radiance Calculations Over Global Oceans
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared (IR) environmental satellite data assimilation and remote sensing of the surface and lower troposphere depend on the accurate specification of the spectral surface emissivity within clear-sky forward calculations. Over ocean surfaces, accurate modeling of surface-leaving radiances over the sensor scanning swaths is complicated by a quasi-specular bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). Recent findings at the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA) have also revealed significant zonally varying systematic biases (approximate to 0.5| K) on a global scale over cold ocean waters; these are the results of temperature dependence in the thermal IR optical constants. This article proposes practical solutions to these problems by modeling thermal IR "effective emissivity" in a manner that accounts for both surface emission and quasispecular reflectance, along with temperature dependence, while meeting the latency and computational constraints of operational global data assimilation and retrieval systems. We overview the theoretical basis of the model and validate it against ship-based Marine Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (MAERI) spectra obtained from cold and warm water ocean campaigns.

TI  - Invasive <i>Aedes japonicus</i> Mosquitoes Dominate the <i>Aedes</i> Fauna Collected with Gravid Traps in Wooster, Northeastern Ohio, USA
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Aedes japonicus is an invasive mosquito in America and it is considered as a secondary vector of arboviruses. Little is known about the distribution and abundance of Ae. japonicus in many states of the United States of America. In this study, CDC light, BG-sentinel, and gravid traps were used to collect mosquitoes between June and October 2021, in Wooster, Northeastern Ohio, USA. Morphological identification unveiled that, Ae. japonicus mosquitoes were the most abundant mosquito species collected with gravid traps in Wooster in 2021, confirming its establishment in Ohio. A phylogenetic analysis of Ae. japonicus revealed 100% nucleotide similarity with those found in Iowa (USA), Canada and Belgium, suggesting multiple introductions. Its presence may increase the risk of future pathogens outbreaks in Wooster, Ohio. Future works should include the genetic diversity characterization of Ae. japonicus in Wooster. Aedes japonicus (Diptera: Culicidae), or the Asian rock pool mosquito, is an invasive mosquito in Europe and America. It was first detected outside of Asia in 1990 in Oceania. It has since expanded to North America and Europe in 1998 and 2000, respectively. Even though it is classified as a secondary vector of pathogens, it is competent to several arboviruses and filarial worms, and it is contributing to the transmission of La Crosse virus (LACV) and West Nile virus (WNV). In this study, CDC light, BG-sentinel, and gravid traps were used to collect mosquitoes between June and October 2021, in Wooster, Northeastern Ohio, USA. Morphological identification or/and Sanger sequencing were performed to identify the collected mosquitoes. Our results revealed that (adult) Ae. japonicus mosquitoes were the most abundant mosquito species collected with gravid traps in Wooster in 2021, confirming its establishment in Ohio. Molecular analyses of Ae. japonicus showed 100% nucleotide similarity with Ae. japonicus collected in Iowa (USA) and Canada, suggesting multiple introductions. Its presence may increase the risk of future arbovirus outbreaks in Wooster, Ohio. This study stresses the importance of actively monitoring the density and distribution of all members of the Ae. japonicus complex.

T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using Landsat satellite images, this study evaluated the morphological evolution of the Binahaan River, Palo from 2000-2020. It focuses on quantifying the morphological changes in terms of river planform parameters namely channel width, channel length, channel area, and sinuosity, as well as erosion and accretion rates. Multi-temporal satellite images were collected and analyzed to recog-nize the quinquennial and seasonal alterations. With the quantification of the spatial extent and rates of bank-line alterations by means of remote sensing, the purpose is to better understand the erosion and accretion processes of the Binahaan River from the perspective of its planform parameters. Throughout the study period, the river experienced significant morphological changes in planform; however, no consistent trend was found due to the dynamic nature of the river. The seasonal and quinquennial erosion and accretion rates of the river were also analyzed. It was found that the right bank line was more susceptible to erosion and accretion. Seasonally, the river was more prone to sediment accumulation which led to the narrowing of channel widths and decreasing channel area. In the quinquennial comparison during the dry seasons, the river was mostly dominated by erosion, while during wet seasons, the river was more prone to accretion. In terms of change in the area, whether by loss or gain of land, the river consistently displayed increasing change from 2000 to 2020. The results of this study could be utilized to develop an integrated strategy for its management and restore the fundamental processes that shape and maintain the river.

TI  - Productive Crop Field Detection: A New Dataset and Deep-Learning Benchmark Results
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In precision agriculture, detecting productive crop fields is an essential practice that allows the farmer to evaluate operating performance separately and compare different seed varieties, pesticides, and fertilizers. However, manually identifying productive fields is often time-consuming, costly, and subjective. Previous studies explore different methods to detect crop fields using advanced machine-learning (ML) algorithms to support the specialists' decisions, but they often lack good quality labeled data. In this context, we propose a high-quality dataset generated by machine operation combined with Sentinel-2 images tracked over time. As far as we know, it is the first one to overcome the lack of labeled samples by using this technique. In sequence, we apply a semisupervised classification of unlabeled data and state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised deep-learning (DL) methods to detect productive crop fields automatically. Finally, the results demonstrate high accuracy in positive unlabeled (PU) learning, which perfectly fits the problem where we have high confidence in the positive samples. Best performances have been found in Triplet Loss Siamese given the existence of an accurate dataset and contrastive learning considering situations where we do not have a comprehensive labeled dataset available.

TI  - <i>In vivo</i> prostate cancer research: Key interspecies prostate anatomical features for translation medicine
T2  - OPEN VETERINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is a prevalent malignancy affecting men worldwide. Animal models play a crucial role in studying PCa pathology and discovering novel approaches to prevent, detect and treat this disease. However, the challenge of translational medicine is the limited reproducibility and inadequate recapitulation of human conditions in animal models. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the macroscopic and microscopic anatomy of the prostate gland among distinct animal species is essential for better translating research findings to clinical practice. This review aims to compare and describe the macroscopic and microscopic anatomy of the prostate gland in humans, rats, and dogs, emphasizing the relevant features. Despite the anatomical differences between these species, rats are a valuable model to study human prostate diseases, once they share some features implicated in carcinogenesis in humans. Dogs, on the other hand, are considered the best model for studying PCa due to the development of spontaneous cancer with a higher incidence when compared with other animals and the development of bone metastases. Moreover, the lymphatic system and the sentinel lymph node role and mapping are similar in dogs and humans. However, it is important to recognize that no animal model can directly mimic all aspects of PCa as the human prostate is anatomically different from that of rats and dogs. Therefore, it is essential to analyze and understand the intra- and interspecies variability when translating research findings into clinical practice. This review highlights the importance of a thorough understanding of the anatomical differences between the prostate gland in humans, rats, and dogs when selecting the appropriate animal model for studying PCa.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Change Monitoring and Prediction of a UNESCO World Heritage Site: Kaziranga Eco-Sensitive Zone Using Cellular Automata-Markov Model
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kaziranga Eco-Sensitive Zone is located on the edge of the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot region. In 1985, the Kaziranga National Park (KNP) was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Nowadays, anthropogenic interference has created a significant negative impact on this national park. As a result, the area under natural habitat is gradually decreasing. The current study attempted to analyze the land use land cover (LULC) change in the Kaziranga Eco-Sensitive Zone using remote sensing data with CA-Markov models. Satellite remote sensing and the geographic information system (GIS) are widely used for monitoring, mapping, and change detection of LULC change dynamics. The changing rate was assessed using thirty years (1990-2020) of Landsat data. The study analyses the significant change in LULC, with the decrease in the waterbody, grassland and agricultural land, and the increase of sand or dry river beds, forest, and built-up areas. Between 1990 and 2020, waterbody, grassland, and agricultural land decreased by 18.4, 9.96, and 64.88%, respectively, while sand or dry river beds, forest, and built-up areas increased by 103.72, 6.96, and 89.03%, respectively. The result shows that the area covered with waterbodies, grassland, and agricultural land is mostly converted into built-up areas and sand or dry river bed areas. According to this study, by 2050, waterbodies, sand or dry river beds, and forests will decrease by 3.67, 3.91, and 7.11%, respectively; while grassland and agriculture will increase by up to 16.67% and 0.37%, respectively. The built-up areas are expected to slightly decrease during this period (up to 2.4%). The outcome of this study is expected to be useful for the long-term management of the Kaziranga Eco-Sensitive Zone.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Olive orchard intensification has transformed an originally drought-resilient tree crop into a competing water user in semi-arid regions. In our study, we used remote sensing to evaluate whether intensive olive plantations have increased between 2010 and 2020, contributing to the current risk of aquifer depletion in the Saiss plain in Morocco. We developed an unsupervised approach based on the principles of hierarchical clustering and used for each year of analysis two images (5 m pixel size) from the PlanetLabs archive. We first calculated area-based accuracy metrics for 2020 with reference data, reaching a user's accuracy of 0.95 and a producer's accuracy of 0.89. For 2010, we verified results among different plot size ranges using available 2010 Google Earth Imagery, reaching high accuracy among the 50 largest plots (correct classification rate, CCR, of 0.94 in 2010 and 0.92 in 2020) and lower accuracies among smaller plot sizes. This study allowed us to map super-intensive olive plantations, thereby addressing an important factor in the groundwater economy of many semi-arid regions. Besides the expected increase in plantation size and the emergence of new plantations, our study revealed that some plantations were also given up, despite the political framework encouraging the opposite.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of land-based ecological potential is a key management factor in achieving sustainable development and conserving soil and water resources. The purpose of this study is to use multi-time images of Sentinel-2 to determine the area of agricultural lands and evaluate their ecological potential in Bastam, Semnan Province, Iran. Therefore, in the first step, the most common agricultural lands (including apricot and grape orchards), field crops (including wheat and forage maize), and their phenological period were determined. Then, the information was classified using, namely support vector machine, maximum likelihood, and minimum distance. In the next step, soil, topography, and climate data were extracted according to expert opinions and the analysis of the basin's natural potential. The ecological evaluation models of the region were applied to homogeneous units, and after calculating the ecological potential index by the integrated ANP-WLC model, the ecological potential map was generated. The results of the land use classification showed that the support vector machine model and the minimum distance, respectively, had the best and worst performance with kappa coefficient of 0.82 and 0.61. The highest area of cultivated lands (3423 hectares) was estimated for wheat and the lowest (738 hectares) for forage maize. Moreover, the results of the ecological potential evaluation showed that 60% of apricot orchards, and 40.19% of the wheat fields, were in the class of good ecological potential. Overall, 2290 hectares were in the poor class, and 4030 hectares in the excellent class in terms of ecological potential.

A positivist worldview and a quantitative cross-sectional survey were used to collect data from 210 business school students who had completed postgraduate entrepreneurship courses at two public universities in the western region of Zimbabwe. The predictors of the hypothetical model explained 49 percent of the variance in respondents' intentions to pursue sustainable entrepreneurship. Only the attitude toward the behaviour variable had a statistically significant direct impact on sustainable entrepreneurial intention. Subjective norms had an indirect effect on sustainable entrepreneurial intention, which was entirely mediated by attitude toward behaviour. Individualistic values had no statistically significant moderating effect on the relationships between the predictors of intention and the intention to engage in sustainable entrepreneurship. The study's findings have implications for business schools' efforts to contribute to the goal of sustainable development. The study contributes to the development of the literature by evaluating the relevance of the theory of planned behaviour to sustainable entrepreneurship.

TI  - Band Reconstruction Using a Modified UNet for Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral (MS) remote sensing images are of great interest for various applications, yet, quite often, an MS product exhibits one or more noisy bands, strip lines, or even missing bands, which leads to decreased confidence in the information it contains. Meeting this challenge, this article proposes a UNet-based neural network architecture to reconstruct a spectral band. The worst case scenario is considered, that of a missing band, the reconstruction being performed based on the available bands. Besides the comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both the qualitative and quantitative analyses are fulfilled considering several metrics: root-mean-square error, structural similarity index, signal-to-reconstruction error, peak-signal-to-noise ratio, and spectral angle mapper. The experiments focus on Sentinel-2 open data within the Copernicus program. Various patterns of urban areas, agricultural regions, and regions from North Pole or Kyiv, Ukraine are included in our dataset to prove the efficiency of band reconstruction regardless of land-cover diversity.

AB  - The frequency of forest fires has increased significantly in recent years across the planet. Events of this nature motivate the development of automated methodologies aimed at mapping areas affected by fire. In this context, we propose a method capable of accurately mapping areas affected by fire using time series of remotely sensed multispectral images by statistical modeling and classification. In order to evaluate the introduced proposal, we carry out a case study on a region in Brazil with recurrent history of forest fires. Furthermore, images obtained by the Landsat-8 satellite are used in this case study. Comparisons with an alternative method are included in this analysis.

TI  - Windthrow characteristics and their regional association with rainfall, soil, and surface elevation in the Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Windthrows (trees uprooted and broken by winds) are common across the Amazon. They range in size from single trees to large gaps that lead to changes in forest dynamics, composition, structure, and carbon balance. Yet, the current understanding of the spatial variability of windthrows is limited. By integrating remote sensing data and geospatial analysis, we present the first study to examine the occurrence, area, and direction of windthrows and the control that environmental variables exert on them across the whole Amazon. Windthrows are more frequent and larger in the northwestern Amazon (Peru and Colombia), with the central Amazon (Brazil) being another hot spot of windthrows. The predominant direction of windthrows is westward. Rainfall, surface elevation, and soil characteristics explain the variability (20%-50%) of windthrows but their effects vary regionally. A better understanding of the spatial dynamics of windthrows will improve understanding of the functioning of Amazon forests.

TI  - Multispectral Crop Yield Prediction Using 3D-Convolutional Neural Networks and Attention Convolutional LSTM Approaches
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, national economies are highly affected by crop yield predictions. By early prediction, the market price can be predicted, importing, and exporting plan can be provided, social, and economic effects of waste products can be minimized, and a program can be presented for humanitarian food aid. In addition, agricultural fields are constantly growing to generate products required. The use of machine learning (ML) methods in this sector can lead to the efficient production and high-quality agricultural products. Traditional predictive machine models were unable to find nonlinear relationships between data. Recently, there has been a revolution in prediction systems via the advancement of ML, which can be used to achieve highly accurate decision-making networks. Thus far, many strategies have been used to evaluate agricultural products, such as DeepYield, CNN-LSTM, and ConvLSTM. However, preferable prediction accuracy is required. In this study, two architectures have been proposed. The first model includes 2D-CNN, skip connections, and LSTM-Attentions. The second model comprises 3D-CNN, skip connections, and ConvLSTM Attention. The Input data given from MODIS products such as Land-Cover, Surface-Temperature, and MODIS-Land-surface from 2003 to 2018 on the county level over 1800 counties, where soybean is mainly cultivated in the USA. The proposed methods have been compared with the most recent models. Then, the results showed that the second proposed method notably outperformed the other techniques. In case of MAE, the second proposed method, DeepYield, ConvLSTM, 3DCNN, and CNN-LSTM obtained 4.3, 6.003, 6.05, 6.3, and 7.002, respectively.

TI  - Ethno-religious Stereotypes and Attitudes towards Christians in Japan in the 16th-19th Centuries
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the conclusions of ethnic psychology about the nature of negative ethno-religious stereotypes, the authors aim to trace exactly how such stereotypes were used in the anti-Christian policy in Japan during the Edo period (1603-1868). From 1614 to 1873 Christianity in Japan was banned at the state level. The Tokugawa shogunate, which ruled Japan for most of this period, pursued a policy of discrimination and the eradication of Christianity, seeking to control the sphere of religion in Japanese society. To reveal this topic, the authors use different types of sources: anti-Christian works, state laws and propaganda materials. Anti-Christian texts of the period under review are used as the main sources. "Kirishitan Monogatari", an anonymous work written in 1639, contains much important information that demonstrates stereotypes about Japanese Christians. Also, the book of the former Christian turned anti-Christian propagandist Fabian Fukan (1565-1621) "Ha Dayusu" (1620) was used. It contains criticism of Western religion and justifies violent actions against Christians, sanctioned by the shogunate. Among the laws, the Decree "Bateren Tsuiho no Fumi" deserves special attention, which, unlike the laws that preceded it, finally banned Christianity throughout the country. In addition, the authors note the propaganda value of wooden notice boards kosatsu that were hung all over the country. Along with reminding about the state ban on Christianity, they often used terms that were caused by negative stereotypes in relation to Christians. It is a common belief among religious and cultural scholars in Japan that Christianity had little influence and remained a minority religion. According to R. Stark and W. Bainbridge, Christianity in Japan was considered an "other" doctrine. Based on the consideration of specific materials, the authors try to answer the question of whether the thesis about the "otherness" of Christianity in Japan can be considered sufficiently objective. Summing up the results of the study, the authors came to the conclusion that in relation to Japanese Christians in the 16th - 19th centuries, a negative ethno-religious stereotype was maintained at the official level, according to which they were considered people subjected to the religious influence of the "West", becoming a tool directed against the traditional foundations of Japanese society. However, they were not "other", defined by ethnic origin or nationality, social or economic status. Rather, they were "others" who adopted a certain worldview (religious), as well as a set of beliefs and values of other peoples. Thus, in general, one cannot deny the original "otherness" of Christianity for Japanese culture, but in a sense, its many years of contradictory influence can also be considered as a positive moment for the development of intercultural interaction.

M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with the personality of Cassiodorus, philosopher, theologian, statesman of the 6th century. Cassiodorus' works reflect the changes in his worldview, his interests in different periods of his life. The focus of the study is the most famous work of the Italian philosopher "Institutiones divinarum et saecularium litterarum". In this work he formulated his views on school education and the spiritual enlightenment of his fellow citizens. Cassiodorus attaches particular importance to reading as the only reliable way to gain knowledge. In the "Instructiones" he consistently holds the idea that the program of the Christian school needs a synthesis of theology and worldly sciences. Without losing interest in history as a science, in his mature years Cassiodorus strives to see the unity of human history as a process that is under the influence of the will of God.

AB  - The article analyzes the ontology model formulated by Friedrich Dessauer in the monograph Man and Space. The subject of analysis is, on the one hand, the method used by Dessauer to distinguish four worlds (physical, biological, mental, and spiritual), on the other hand, the method of solving the problem of the interaction of worlds, which constitutes the original theory of activity. The latter underlies his philosophy of technology, formulated in the monograph The Dispute about Technology. Dessauer is a classic of the philosophy of technology, both analyzed monographs are available in Russian translation. The purpose of the analysis carried out in the article in the historical and philosophical terms is to identify methodological parallels in the models of the philosophy of technology by Peter K. Engelmeier, the philosophy of science by Karl Popper and actually by Friedrich Dessauer; in ontological terms in identifying the correlation of ontology, real science, and metaphysics in Dessauer's model, in terms of the philosophy of technology in identifying the minimum necessary structure of technical action in a pluralistic ontology. The research method is semiotic modeling, which consists in expressing the worlds in the form of independent complexes of pragmatic, syntactic, and semantic rules, where the interaction of the worlds is considered as an independent semiosis. The results of the study are, firstly, in the explication of Dessauer's ontology by means of semiotics, and, secondly, in the ontological substantiation of the thesis that the structure of the interaction of the worlds, as it is fixed and used in the scientific and technical worldview, is the structure of technical activity. Understanding the structure of technical activity, in turn, sets an ontological model of scientific and technological progress, which makes it possible to formulate an expert assessment of the current state of affairs, as well as to create predictive scenarios for the development of the technosphere.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquake monitoring plays a key role in human life protection, especially in highly populated areas of the Earth. First indications have been found in SAMPEX and NOAA satellite data that particle fluxes of trapped electrons in the Van Allen belts can be correlated to seismic activity on the ground. Within the framework of the CSES mission, a systematic analysis of the electron flux, within the invariant phase space in the L-shell and equatorial pitch angle, has started with the goal to identify short-term variations of the flux (particle bursts) in conjunction with seismic activity. This analysis is based on the statistical evaluation of the flux measurements and built to be potentially implemented in an online monitoring system. The first milestone in that direction has been achieved, providing a stable background estimation. With the injection of artificial signals, the efficiency of the method was evaluated and found to be better than 95% for isolated (one per day) and short (similar to 3 min) signals with a significance >= 5 sigma above the background. The developed method is set up in a manner to be easily applicable to data from different instruments and satellites. This article presents the studied datasets of the low-energy HEPP instrument onboard the CSES-01 satellite and the electron telescopes of the MEPED detector onboard the NOAA POES-19 satellite, introduces the method for the background estimation, and discusses the first correlation studies of particle bursts with geomagnetic indices obtained within this framework.

TI  - Estimating the cost of illness of acute Japanese encephalitis and sequelae care in Vietnam and Laos: A cross-sectional study.
T2  - PLOS global public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a leading cause of acute encephalitis syndrome and resulting neurological disability in Asia and the Western Pacific. This study aims to estimate the cost of acute care, initial rehabilitation and sequelae care, in Vietnam and Laos.METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective study using a micro-costing approach from the health system and household perspectives. Out-of-pocket direct medical and non-medical costs, indirect costs, and family impact were reported by patients and/or caregivers. Hospitalization costs were extracted from hospital charts. Acute costs covered expenditures from pre-hospital to follow-up visits while sequelae care costs were estimated from expenditures in the last 90 days. All costs are in 2021 US dollars.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 242 patients in two major sentinel sites in the North and South of Vietnam and 65 patients in a central hospital in Vientiane, Laos, with laboratory-confirmed JE were recruited regardless of age, sex, and ethnicity. In Vietnam, the mean total cost was $3,371 per acute JE episode (median $2,071, standard error [SE] $464) while annual costs were $404 for initial sequelae care (median $0, SE $220) and $320 for long-term sequelae care (median $0, SE $108). In Laos, the mean hospitalization costs in acute stage were $2,005 (median $1,698, SE $279) and the mean annual costs were $2,317 (median $0, SE $2,233) for initial sequelae care and $89 (median $0, SE $57) for long-term sequelae care. In both countries, most patients did not seek care for their sequelae. Families perceived extreme impact from JE and 20% to 30% of households still had sustained debts years after acute JE.CONCLUSIONS: JE patients and families in Vietnam and Laos suffer extreme medical, economic, and social hardship. This has policy implications for improving JE prevention in these two JE-endemic countries.

AB  - The dike surrounding the coast of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) helps prevent saltwater intrusion and coastal erosion. In order to preserve these dikes, an area of protective forest is planted outside them, helping to maintain and strengthen them. Therefore, monitoring the change in the area of planted forest outside the dike will help to assess the stability of and possible threats to the coastal area and ecosystem. In this paper, using Sentinel remote sensing images, we pro-pose a new approach; applying the Random Forest technique to assess the changes in the planted forest outside the dike. The experimental results obtained on a typical coastal area of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta will help to clearly identify the threats and the evolution of the coastline through the changes in forest area outside the dike.

AB  - Urbanization is a primary driver that leads to the increase of urban heat, including air temperature and surface temperature. Recently, Hanoi city has been experienced a high urbanization rate, especially at the edge of the inner city. In this study, the surface temperature bands of Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 Collection 2 Level-2 were directly utilized to calculate LST for the study area at the two selected years 2005 and 2019. Furthermore, the spatial-temporal changes in Land Surface Temperature (LST) in the period 2005-2019 were analyzed and the relationships between Normalized Land Surface Temperature (NLST) and the two indices NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDBI (Normalized Difference Builtup Index) were clarified. The study results indicated a significant increase in the mean LST and the mean NLST between 2005 and 2019. In fact, the mean LST rose from 33.18 to 38.06 degrees C and the mean NLST rose from 0.38 to 0.43. Additionally, a negative correlations between NLST and NDVI were explored at correlation coefficients (R) of -0.69 and -0.77 in 2005 and 2019, respectively. In contrast, a positive relationships between NLST and NDBI were shown at R-value of 0.74 and 0.85. The outcomes revealed the importance of vegetation in urban cooling and forces authorities to implement urban green space planning seriously.

AB  - Surface characteristics are believed to be the primary factor causing spatial variation in land surface temperature (LST), especially in a large and rapidly growing city like Ho Chi Minh City. The study aims to estimate the spatial relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and impervious surface density (ISA) by using three statistical techniques: 1) Optimized hot spot analysis; 2) Global linear regression (OLS); and 3) Geographically weighted regression (GWR). LST and ISA were extracted from Landsat 8 OLI of 2020. According to the optimized hot spot analysis's findings, over 80% of the areas of high ISA values ( mean ISA: 0.86, SD: 0.13) overlap with areas of high LST values (mean LST: 36.2 degrees C, SD: 2.04 degrees C), with a correlation coefficient of r=0.775. Likewise, Moran's I index (I=0.82, Z=72, P<0.001) indicates that LST in Ho Chi Minh City has a significantly spatial dependence, so geographically weighted regression (GWR) and global linear (OLS) models need to be taken into account simultaneously. Coefficient of determination R-2 and AICc (Akaike information criterion corrected) were used to compare the models. R-2 increases from 0.78 to 0.87, whereas AICc decreases from 8047 to 7033 in OLS and GWR, respectively. GWR has a more substantial explanatory power for the association between LST and ISA and offers superior LST prediction accuracy compared to OLS. Potential urban heat island areas can be accurately detected by combining GWR and optimized hot spot analysis.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the changes of riverbanks of the Go Gia River in the Can Gio District for the period 2013-2021 using remote sensing and GIS. This study used multi-temporal Landsat satellite images, including nine Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images in the period 2013-2021 to classify the riverbanks for each time period and to calculate the change rates of river banks. Combination of AWEI (Automated Water Extraction Index) and thresholding method was used to extract the river bank. Results showed that the processes of erosion and accretion intertwined but most of the main riverbanks had erosion trend in the period 2013-2021. Evaluating the riverbank changes using multi-temporal remote sensing data may contributed an important reference to managing and protecting the riverbanks.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the variation of land surface temperature (LST) and its effect on the urban heat island (UHI) in relation to the urban planning processes of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) from the years 2010 to 2020. These changes have impacted the urban environmental conditions and the city development. The study used the time series of Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI acquired for the years 2010, 2015, and 2020, and used the algorithms for calculating the land surface temperature (LST), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) to investigate the relationships between these phenomena in the city planning processes. The results highlight the increase in land surface temperature was related to the dense of impervious surface area and the decrease of vegetation area. The UHI zones occurred in the areas with high LST and NDBI values, and low NDVI values (concentrated in the central districts and the planned areas) compared to the surrounding areas with lower LST and NDBI and higher NDVI. The recommend planning solutions for the new urban development areas should focus on increasing the amount green areas to combat the UHI phenomenon and environmental problems against the development.

TI  - DJSPNet: Deep Joint Statistical-Spatial Pooling Network for High-Resolution SAR Image Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The previous approaches based on statistical features or spatial features have achieved promising performance on pixel-wise high-resolution (HR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image classification, but these methods always cannot capture local spatial features and global statistical properties efficiently because of the complex spatial structural patterns and statistical nature in SAR patches. Inspired by this, we propose a deep joint statistical-spatial pooling network (DJSPNet), for HR SAR image classification, which combines a group second-order statistical feature learning (GSFL) block and an efficient feature-fusion style (EFS) into an end-to-end feature learning block. GSFL block is designed with a group second-order feature learning method in two steps, where the first step divides convolutional channels into several semantic groups. The second step collects second-order feature statistics by calculating pairwise feature interactions within each group. EFS models second-order attentional statistics between statistical characteristics and spatial features by polynomial kernel approximation and guides the discriminative feature activations in SAR patches. More specifically, both GSFL and EFS are stacked and plugged into the encoder stage of conventional U-Net for distinguishable feature learning. Experimental results suggest that the proposed DJSPNet gives better classification performance compared with related deep feature learning networks on a real TerraSAR-X dataset.

TI  - Low-Grade Ductal Carcinoma in situ Within a Fibroadenoma of the Breast: A Rare Case Report and Review of the Literature
T2  - ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Ductal carcinoma in situ within a breast fibroadenoma is a rare malignancy with an incidence of only 0.02-0.125%. Imaging of low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ within a breast fibroadenoma shows no specific presentation. Therefore, pathology and immunohistochemistry are required for definitive diagnosis. Surgery is currently considered to be an effective treatment. There is no uniform clinical standard for postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy. Case Summary: A 60-year-old female patient underwent excisional biopsy on October 19, 2022. Pathology and immunohistochem-istry confirmed the diagnosis of low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ within the fibroadenoma. Subsequently, breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation, and no cancer metastasis was observed in the sentinel lymph nodes or incisional margins. Conclusion: Low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ within a breast fibroadenoma is an extremely rare malignancy, and clinicians should be familiar with its clinicopathological features and treatment methods. Multidisciplinary joint treatment is recommended to maximize the benefits to patients.

AB  - Bathymetry studies are important to monitor the changes occurring in coastal topographies, to update navigation charts, and to understand the dynamics of the marine environment. Satellite-derived bathymetry enables rapid mapping of large coastal areas through measurement of optical penetration of the water column. In this study, bathymetry prediction is investigated using Pleiades multispectral sat-ellite data. This research work explores the possibility of using very-high-resolution multispectral satellite data with a deep learning U-Net-inspired neural network architecture to infer bathymetry estimates around Europa Island (22 degrees 20' S, 40 degrees 22' E), which is a coralline island in the Mozambique Channel. This study is among the first to provide an overview suitable for bathymetry mapping using a deep learning approach based on optical satellite data. An airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) dataset of 1 m resolution is used as ground truth to train the model. From experiments, the overall accuracy evaluation of the model shows a good relationship (R-2 = 0.99, standard error = 0.492) between the predicted and reference depth values that satisfy the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) S-57 Category of Zone of Confidence (CATZOC) levels A1, A2, B, and C (IHO, 2014). These pre-dicted bathymetry values could potentially be incorporated into electronic naviga-tional charts. The image reconstruction shows accurate results to estimate bathymetry in the shallow waters with mean absolute error not exceeding 1.5 m in that case. The U-Net-inspired deep learning technique exhibits promising outcomes to predict water depth from very-high-resolution satellite data to operate bathymetry mapping automatically over a wide area.

TI  - Rethinking BiSeNet: A Lightweight Network for Urban Water Extraction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban water runs through and plays an important role in urban development, and understanding the spatial changes of urban water bodies is significant. However, the rapid growth of remote sensing data caused by rapid urbanization poses a challenge to the efficiency of water extraction methods. In this article, a high-precision method with a lightweight structure for urban water extraction was proposed in terms of the dilemma between efficiency and accuracy. We designed a squeeze-and-excitation attention refined module (SE-ARM), squeeze-and-excitation feature fusion module (SE-FFM), and depth-wise atrous spatial pyramid pooling (DW-ASPP) based on BiSeNet to improve it in the water semantic segmentation application, which resulted in SE-BiSeNet. To validate the proposed model's effectiveness, we compared our SE-BiSeNet to other advanced water extraction methods on the Chengdu dataset in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The results showed that the proposed model performs well in both accuracy [0.96 intersection over union (IoU)] and efficiency (6.4 frame/s on a GTX 1060 card) with fewer parameters and calculations, which indicates an objective application potential.

TI  - The Influence of FY-4A High-Frequency LST Data on Data Assimilation in a Climate Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the Beijing Climate Center's land surface model BCC_AVIM2.0, an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm is developed to assimilate the land surface temperature (LST) product of the first satellite of Fengyun-4 series meteorological satellites of China to study the influence of LST data with different time frequencies on the surface temperature data assimilations. The MODIS daytime and nighttime LST products derived from Terra and Aqua satellites are used as independent validation data to test the assimilation results. The results show that diurnal variation information in the FY-4A LST data has significant effect on the assimilation results. When the time frequencies of the assimilated FY-4A LST data are sufficient, the assimilation scheme can effectively reduce the errors and the assimilation results reflect more reasonable spatial and temporal distributions. The assimilation experiments with a 3 h time frequency show less bias as well as RMSEs and higher temporal correlations than that of the model simulations at both daytime and nighttime periods. As the temporal frequency of assimilated LST observations decreases, the assimilation effects gradually deteriorate. When diurnal variation information is not considered at all in the assimilation, the assimilation with 24 h time frequency showed the largest errors and smallest time correlations in all experiments. The results demonstrate the potential of assimilating high-frequency FY-4A LST data to improve the performance of the BCC_AVIM2.0 land surface model. Furthermore, this study indicates that the diurnal variation information is a necessary factor needed to be considered when assimilating the FY-4A LST.

TI  - A combined sea and sea-ice surface temperature climate dataset of the Arctic, 1982-2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface temperature is one of the main parameters for assessing climate change. Temperature change is most pronounced in the Arctic, and therefore, it is crucial to accurately estimate sea and sea ice surface temperatures in this region. The availability of in situ observations is limited in the Arctic, thus, increasing the need for satellite observations to estimate surface temperatures. We present the first Arctic (>58 & DEG;N) gap-free climate dataset covering the surface temperatures of the ocean, sea ice and the marginal ice zone from 1 January 1982 to 31 May 2021 based on observations from infrared satellite sensors. The underlying algorithm combines the multi satellite observations and performs a statistical optimal interpolation to obtain daily gap-free fields, with a spatial resolution of 0.05 & DEG; in latitude and longitude. In situ observations have been used to derive consistent validation statistics over the ocean and sea ice. Comparison of the derived sea surface temperatures against in situ measurements from drifting buoys, moored buoys and Argo floats shows mean differences of 0.01 & DEG;C, 0.04 & DEG;C and 0.04 & DEG;C and standard deviations of 0.54 & DEG;C, 0.56 & DEG;C and 0.51 & DEG;C, respectively. Over sea ice, the derived ice surface temperatures have been compared with KT-19 measurements from IceBridge flights, showing a mean difference of 1.52 & DEG;C and standard deviation of 3.12 & DEG;C, and with air temperatures from the North Pole (NP) ice drifting stations as well as ECMWF distributed buoys and CRREL buoys, with mean differences of-2.35 & DEG;C,-3.21 & DEG;C and -2.87 & DEG;C and standard deviations of 3.12 & DEG;C, 3.34 & DEG;C and 3.36 & DEG;C, respectively. The combination of sea and sea-ice surface temperature provides a consistent dataset for climate analysis, which is crucial for studying climate change and trends in the Arctic. The combined sea and sea-ice surface temperature of the Arctic has risen with about 4.5 & DEG;C over the period 1982-2021, with a peak warming of around 10 & DEG;C in the northeastern Barents Sea.

AB  - Remote sensing plays an important role in characterizing the land surface by extensively concerning its spatial resolution. Most of the time, spectral and temporal resolution becomes a limitation, which now can be overcome via unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a remote sensing platform. The study utilizes the google earth engine cloud-based platform to prepare the classified maps from Sentinel 2 and UAV datasets using the Random Forest algorithm. The canopy cover was estimated using UAV data and divided into 4 classes: very dense forest, moderately dense forest, open forest and scrub forest. The majority (39%) areas were under scrub forest. Furthermore, the land use land cover was prepared using UAV data and showed superior results with 95.5% overall accuracy compared with 86.5% of Sentinel 2. Lastly, the tree count of the area was estimated using high-resolution data. The predicted number of trees was 3052, with an accuracy of 82%. The tree count algorithm works better in plantation and even canopy-size trees. Thus, this methodology ultimately helps to achieve the sustainable use of resources concerning their availability, demand and exploitation in the study area. The estimated results can help policymakers, government officials, and local people halt desertification and better sustainable forest management.

TI  - Modeling SAR Observables by Combining a Crop-Growth Model With Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, our aim is to estimate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observables, such as backscatter in VV and VH polarizations, as well as the VH/VV ratio, cross ratio, and interferometric coherence in VV, from agricultural fields. In this study, we use the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) crop-growth simulation model to simulate parcel-level phenological and growth parameters for over 1500 parcels of silage maize in the Netherlands. The crop model was calibrated using field data, including silage maize phenological phases, leaf area index, and above-ground dry biomass (AGB). The simulations incorporate fine-resolution gridded precipitation data and soil parameters to model the interaction between soil-plant-atmosphere and genotype in DSSAT. The crop variables produced by DSSAT are then used as inputs to a support vector regression model. This model is trained to simulate SAR observables in 2017, 2018, and 2019, and its performance is evaluated using independent fields in each of these years. The results show a close fit between modeled and observed SAR C-band observables. The importance of vegetation variables in the estimation of SAR observables is assessed. The AGB showed significant importance in the estimation of backscatter. This study demonstrates the potential value of combining crop-growth simulation models and machine learning to simulate SAR observables. For example, the SVR model developed here could be used as an observation operator in an assimilation context to constrain vegetation and soil water dynamics in a crop-growth model.

TI  - IMPROVEMENT OF THE ALGORITHM FOR INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSTICS OF BREAST CANCER METASTASIS USING SENTINEL LYMPH NODE STAINING
T2  - WORLD OF MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphatic metastasis is one of the most important causes of local BC recurrence and an unfavourable prognosis factor. With the beginning of application in the surgical practice of staining sentinel lymph nodes using modern dyes (Patent Blue, ICG), the approach to determining the extent of surgical intervention has changed radically Performing the staining of sentinel lymph nodes in breast tumours allows for reducing the trauma of surgical intervention as much as possible (due to the refusal of axillary lymph node dissection), as a result of which the number of postoperative complications is minimised. The purpose of the study was to improve the algorithm for intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer. Between 2016 and 2021, 200 patients with T1-T3N0M0 breast cancer were operated on at the Odesa Regional Clinical Hospital using two dyes: Patent Blue and ICG. The proposed algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer allows most cases to abandon traumatic operations in favour of organ-preserving operations with biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes.

TI  - The role and place of transanal endoscopic resections in rectal cancer
T2  - ZAPOROZHYE MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the work is to improve the algorithm of intraoperative diagnosis of rectal cancer metastasis in order to optimize surgical intervention and reduce the number of intraoperative and postoperative complications. Materials and methods. 184 operated patients with rectal cancer (RC) were divided into 2 groups: group 1 - patients with stage I RC (T1-2N0M0), and group 2 - stage II RC (T3N0M0), who underwent intraoperative detection and examination of sentinel lymph nodes. The volume and surgical approach depended on the stage and the presence of metastases (MTS). The average period of postoperative observation was 12-60 months, taking into account early (purulent-septic complications, bleeding, intestinal perforation) and late (recurrent rectal cancer) complications. Results. The patients of group 1 had no MTS lesions of the sentinel lymph nodes, the surgical intervention was limited to transanal microsurgery due to this fact. Among the complications were the following: bleeding - 2.2 %; intraoperative perforation of the in-testinal wall - 5.6 %. No purulent-septic cases, no recurrences of rectal cancer were detected. In group 2, 36 (38.3 %) out of 94 patients had MTS detected intraoperatively in the sentinel lymph nodes which required a low anterior rectal resection with total mesorectumectomy. Among the complications was bleeding - 6.3 %. No intraoperative perfo-rations of the intestinal wall and no purulent-septic complications were detected. Recurrence of rectal cancer was detected in 12 (12.8 %) patients. Conclusions. Performing transanal endoscopic resections in patients with stage I RC and especially stage II RC is possible only under the conditions of mandatory intraoperative staining and urgent histological examination of the sentinel lymph nodes. The extent of the surgical intervention is determined on the operating table based on urgent histological examination results. When MTS lesions of the mesorectal sentinel lymph nodes are detected, the operation should be continued with mandatory mesorectumectomy.

TI  - POPULAR EXPRESSIONS IN ILYA ILF AND EVGENII PETROV'S DILOGY ("THE TWELVE CHAIRS" AND "THE GOLDEN CALF"): AN EXPLANATORY DICTIONARY
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Book Review
AB  - The research paper presents a scientific and critical view on the modern lexicographic tradition of compiling experimental dictionaries; in particular, it analyzes the book by V. M. Mokienko and K. P. Sidorenko "Popular Expressions of Ilya Ilf and Evgenii Petrov's Dilogy ("The Twelve Chairs" and "The Golden Calf")". The authors of this publication have collected and commented on a set of stable expressions, quotations, literary images, and aphoristic expressions used in the texts of the famous novels. The urgency of this source of material can be attributed to the high citation index of the dilogy texts and the active use of the authored intertext in modern journalism and in the Internet space of the 21(st) century. It is stated that Mokienko and Sidorenko have made a successful attempt to compile a dictionary of the popular phrases in the heritage of the great Soviet satirists. The review notes that using the heuristic potential of the descriptive method, the scholars have singled out and analyzed about one thousand original text units of varying degrees of use, expressiveness, structure and functional status. As a merit of the book, it is indicated that the dictionary contains article-by-article comments of historical, cultural and linguistic nature and references to real facts that allow the reader to use artistic allusions as elements of real communication. The material of the dictionary confirms the authors' thesis that the texts by Ilf and Petrov have not yet lost their urgency and originality in the use of linguistic means. Their reproduction in modern discourse is a vivid sign of blogging culture, based on paradoxes, subtle humor and erudition. The article presents a dispute with the authors of the dictionary about the criteria for the selection of popular expressions and the ways of commenting on them. The examples taken from journalistic texts, fiction, and scientific literature of recent years indicate that the large flow of quotations and their intertext derivatives can be explained by an internal powerful associative potential that perfectly fits into the linguistic worldview of the Russian-speaking person of the 21(st) century.

TI  - Deep-Learning-Based Retrieval of an Orange Band Sensitive to Cyanobacteria for Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of an orange band (similar to 620 nm) in the imagery captured by Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2 restricts the detection and quantification of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in inland waters. A recent study suggested the retrieval of orange remote sensing reflectance, R-rs (620), by assuming green, red, and panchromatic (Pan) bands of Landsat-8 as predictors through a linear model. However, this method is not applicable to Sentinel-2 imagery lacking a Pan band. Moreover, the Pan-based method does not account for the nonlinear relationships among the R-rs data at different wavelengths. We propose a deep-learning model called Deep OrAnge Band LEarning Network (DOABLE-Net) that leverages a large training set of R-rs data from radiative transfer simulations and in situ measurements. The proposed DOABLE-Net is structured as five fully connected layers and implemented either with or without the Pan band as an input feature, which only the latter applies to Sentinel-2. DOABLE-Net provided more accurate and robust retrievals than the Pan-based method on a wide range of independent validation datasets. The performance of DOABLE-Net on Landsat-8/9 data was minimally impacted by including the Pan band. The results from Sentinel-2 data analysis also confirmed that the DOABLE-Net provides promising results without using a Pan band.

TI  - Detection of Antarctic Surface Meltwater Using Sentinel-2 Remote Sensing Images via U-Net With Attention Blocks: A Case Study Over the Amery Ice Shelf
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface meltwater critically impacts the Antarctic mass balance and global sea level rise. Quantifying the extent of surface meltwater in Antarctica on a large scale is a challenging task. Traditional methods, such as thresholding, have many limitations. We used a deep learning method, the U-Net with attention blocks, to automatically extract surface meltwater from Sentinel-2 images. We inserted attention mechanism blocks into U-Net to assign different weights to all pixels and channels to utilize the high resolution and multiple channels of Sentinel-2 images. The model was used to map surface water bodies in Sentinel-2 images, and the average accuracy reached 0.9969 on the test dataset. In East Antarctica, the Amery ice shelf (AIS) exhibits the largest surface meltwater area. Studying surface meltwater dynamics on the AIS is useful for understanding the East Antarctic mass balance and demonstrating the model performance. We analyzed the classification results for surface water bodies on the AIS from January 2017 to 2022. Spatially, 96% of surface water bodies are concentrated inland of the AIS from 70(?) S to 73(?) S and account for 93% of the region 20 km from the coastline of the AIS. Temporally, the water body area varies considerably in different years, with a maximum in 2017 (932.54 km(2)) and a minimum in 2021 (58.34 km(2)). The spatial distribution of surface water bodies on the AIS is controlled by the firn air content (FAC), katabatic winds, bare rocks, and blue ice. The interannual variability is associated with complex climate factors, including temperature, surface net solar radiation, snowfall, and snowmelt, among which temperature and snowfall show a strong correlation.

TI  - Spatio-temporal characteristic of terrestrial ecosystem services and their trade offs and synergies in China from 2000 to 2018 based on a process model.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Through pursuit of rapid economic development. China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty science the " reform and opening up". However. the patterns of human development that have dominated over the past decades have resulted in dangerous depletion of natural capital and uneven delivery of essential ecosystem services. To improve the ecological environment and improve people's well.being. the Chinese government has implemented a series of ecological protection projects since 2000.. meanwhile. China has experienced drastic environmental changes. Chinese terrestrial ecosystem services have been significantly altered. A comprehensive understanding of the spatio.temporal patterns of ecosystem services and their trade.offs and synergies have importantly theoretical and practical significance for ecosystem management and sustainable development. Therefore. a newly developed process.based model ( CEVSA.ES) integrating remote sensing data was used to simulate key ecosystem services ( i. e.. net primary productivity. carbon sequestration. water retention. and soil retention) in the Chinese terrestrial ecosystem. Compared to the traditional terrestrial biosphere models. the main innovation of the CEVSA. ES model was the consideration of soil erosion processes and their impact on carbon cycling. The CEVSA.ES model also improved the carbon. water cycle algorithms. We analyzed the spatio.temporal characteristic of ecosystem services and their relationships based on the simulation results of CEVSA.ES model. The results showed that: (1) net primary productivity. carbon sequestration. water retention. and soil retention of the Chinese terrestrial ecosystem in 2018 were 3.68 Pg C/ a. 0.43 Pg C/a. 1015.71 km3/ a. and 208.18 Gt/ a. respectively. The ecosystem services in the eastern monsoon region were remarkably higher than those in the northwest region and Qinghai. Tibet Plateau. Especially. the subtropical.tropical monsoonal region dominated the national ecosystem services. (2) The net primary productivity. carbon sequestration. water retention. and soil retention all showed increasing trends in China from 2000 to 2018. Among them. the net primary productivity. carbon sequestration. water retention showed significant trends. with increase rates were 42.80 Tg C/ a ( P< 0.01). 13.42 Tg C/ a ( P<0.01). and 11.90 km3/a ( P< 0.05). respectively. For different climatic regions. the tropical.subtropical monsoon region dominated the increasing trend of net primary productivity and carbon sequestration. water retention showed no significant increasing trend in all climatic regions. soil conservation only showed a significant increasing trend in the temperate continental region. ( 3) There were synergic relationships among different ecosystem services in China from 2000 to 2018. Productivity was the basis for many ecosystem functions and processes. therefore. there are significant synergic relationships between net primary productivity and other ecosystem services. which laid the foundation for synergies between ecosystem services. Spatially. the areas with synergistic relationship between the two ecosystem services accounted for more than 60% of the total area of the country. where mainly distributed in northern China and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The results could enhance the understanding of changes in ecosystem services and provide references for ecosystem management. Key Words: ecosystem services. trade.offs and synergies. process.based model. CEVSA

TI  - Communication for Social Changemaking: A "New Spirit" in Media and Communication for Development and Social Change?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In pockets of media and communication for development and social change (MCDSC) a distinct set of practices around a worldview emphasizing optimism, chic, creativity, boldness, and "changemaking" is emerging. This trend is in stark contrast with the momentum of our current academic debates exploring the role of communication in the decolonization of MCDSC. This article aims to bring greater critical attention to what I term communication for social changemaking. Through an analysis of selected cases from a sample of program texts spanning 10 years, communication for social changemaking is found to rest on an underlying "spirit" that justifies the employment of capitalist mechanisms for social purposes and a common good. This article argues that there is an urgent need to critically interrupt the assimilation of global capitalist values in MCDSC practice where they undermine social justice goals, and also calls for research to explore how practitioners are both adapting and resisting these discourses.

TI  - The Beginnings of Pessimism in Flaubert's L'<i>Education sentimentale</i>
T2  - ARS & HUMANITAS: JOURNAL OF ARTS AND HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines, from a socio-literary perspective, the origins of pessimism as it takes shape in Flaubert's L'Education sentimentale (1869). It turns out that the pessimistic worldview that we trace in the protagonist Frederic Moreau is closely linked to his attitude towards the consumer society that surrounds him. We first examine the notion of the literary field as elaborated by Pierre Bourdieu in Les Regles de l'art (1992), and then shed light on the protagonist's attitude towards consumerism with the help of Lucien Goldmann's sociology of the novel, in which the development of this literary genre is determined, in socio-literary terms, by the relationship between mediating and mediated value (valeur mediatrice and valeur mediatisee), which is reflected in the novelistic hero labelled a 'problematic individual' (Goldmann 1964). By the second half of the 19th century, this relationship had already completely tilted in favour of the mediating, exchange value of commodities, which overshadowed their use value. We further follow the way in which widespread mercantilism is transforming the role of money, which plays a key role in the emancipation of the literary field and its positioning within the discourse of bourgeois progressivism. Through an analysis of the position of the hero Frederic Moreau in the literary field, it becomes clear that in the society as it is reflected in the novel, not only material goods are commodified, but also the protagonist's desire and the emotions associated with it, with love increasingly assuming the role of symbolic capital and status. Such social relations push the hero into pessimism, of which his velleites (desires without a real will of fulfilment) are a symptom, and place him in a line of anti-heroes which, with the gradual disintegration of the subject, continues with the nihilism of Huysmans' Folantin and the absurdity of Sartre's Roquentin.

TI  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data applications for tropical peatlands monitoring activities: An overview
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for remote sensing (RS) applications brings a new prospect that enables continuous and cloud-free tropical peatlands monitoring ac-tivities. This paper comprises an overview of studies implementing SAR data for tropical peat -lands monitoring activities that summarize the typically discussed topics, commonly utilized SAR data types, and frequently applied methods based on articles published from 2010 to the first se-mester of 2022. Overall, the focus of the studies frequently discussed the following topics: peat mapping, above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation on peatlands, and peat subsidence monitor-ing. The most commonly utilized frequency band of SAR data for the analysis is the L-band, and if the study applied a multi-frequency analysis, the C-and L-band combination is typically selected. Moreover, in terms of polarization, a multi-polarization analysis is more employed than a single -polarization analysis, where the dual-polarization SAR data are mainly utilized. Furthermore, the typically applied methods included: classification schemes (unsupervised, supervised, and ma-chine learning), regression analysis, and interferometric SAR (InSAR) analysis. Finally, SAR data applications, combined with field data, act as a viable solution to be used along with the current techniques for supporting the RS-based tropical peatlands monitoring activities toward the sus-tainable management of tropical peatlands.

TI  - Land subsidence due to natural gas extraction in the Thrace basin (NW Turkey) and its influence on the North Anatolian fault under the Marmara Sea
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We map surface deformation in the Thrace region of Turkey using the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis of the SAR data acquired between 2014 and 2020 on ascending and descending orbits reveals large-scale subsidence (similar to 110 x 60 km) with rates reaching up to 10 +/- 1.5 mm/yr. We relate this deformation to natural gas reservoir operations, such as gas exploitation and extraction activities that have been taking place in the region for decades, an inference being supported by the strong correlation between the InSAR time series and the variation in natural gas production during the same time period in the Thrace region reported by the Energy Market Regulation Authority of Turkey. Assuming that the observed subsidence is caused by compaction of sediments in the natural gas reservoirs, we construct a triangulated surface enveloping roughly at the bottom of the gas extraction wells and use it to invert the amount of negative opening (hence volume loss) on triangular elements that are assumed to be buried in an elastic and homogeneous medium. Coulomb stress changes caused by this volume change on the North Anatolian Fault at the Sea of Marmara are found to be insignificant (less than 10-5 Mega-Pascal) to perturb the state of the stress around the Marmara seismic gap. Yet, the large-scale subsidence revealed in this study needs to be taken into consideration when assessing hazards for the infrastructures, settlements, and other engineering structures, particularly in case of a large earthquake in the Marmara Seismic Gap.

TI  - Development of the triangle method for drought studies based on remote sensing images: A review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Mapping and monitoring drought supports climate change adaptation of resilient ecosystems. The temporal and spatial scale aspects of drought can be efficiently mapped with remote sensing imagery. So far, remote sensing data for drought mapping has focused on the relationship between the vegetation index and surface temperature with various limitations. The interplay between surface temperature and vegetation index (Ts/VI) is well-known in drought research and related studies, such as the triangle method. In 2002, Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) was introduced to model this interplay. Various scholars have explored Ts/VI interaction to determine dry and wet edges and to develop models based on triangle method concepts to monitor drought. However, drought information from Ts/VI identification is not sufficient to justify meteorological, agricultural, or hydrological drought. To address this issue, the TDVI model has been compared with various single indices (VHI, VCI, VDI, TCI, SPI) to reveal their respective advantages and disadvantages. This article reviews several studies that draw on Ts/VI interaction to ascertain dry and wet edges and develop drought identification models with other dryness indicators, such as soil moisture, precipitation, and vegetation change. In general, dry and wet edges are determined using three methods: linear, parabolic, and quadratic, which share a relatively moderate relationship with soil moisture in the field. Most developed models target the determination of dry and wet edges (VTCI, iTVDI, MTVDI) and the addition of potential indicators that may be related to Ts/VI, such as TVMDI, TVMPDI, TVPDI, and TVSDI. Elevation, a manifestation of regional physiographic characteristics, is combined with the Ts/VI concept to create three-dimensional visualizations of the interaction and constantly generate related indicators.

TI  - Multispectral Remote Sensing to Delineate the Distribution Area of Scandium-Bearing Minerals in Bauxite Mining Sites, West Kalimantan Province, Indonesia
T2  - RUDARSKO-GEOLOSKO-NAFTNI ZBORNIK
M3  - Article
AB  - The rising demand for scandium led to massive exploration activities for its discovery from mining by-products. There-fore, this study attempts to delineate the distribution of scandium-bearing minerals in the surrounding bauxite mining area, Tayan District, West Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. Preliminary studies were conducted by applying optical sen-sors to discriminate the types of minerals, such as kaolinite, gibbsite, goethite, and quartz. The spectral information aids the reconnaissance study by providing data on specific rocks and minerals using the short-wave infrared (SWIR), pro-cessed into a series of bands with spectral ranges from 0.35 to 2.5 inm. The data was then compared with the structural lineament from the ALOS PALSAR imagery to infer the prospective area with the structural pattern. The integrated band math minerals and geochemical data taken from X-ray fluorescence and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry suggest that the Sc-bearing minerals were disseminated predominantly on the bauxite laterite profile from pyroxene di-orite and diorite parent rock weathering. The spectral range for goethite as the Sc-bearing minerals is from 0.43 to 1.03, with the main absorption features from 2.0 to. 2.4 . Furthermore, goethite is mainly concentrated at the top bauxite ho-rizon associated with the structurally related hill. The ore-bearing minerals also occupied the tailing pond and some beneficiation areas in relatively minor proportion. This study is undoubtedly valuable for the practical need to support mineral exploration through remote predictive mapping.

TI  - Estimation of Albacore Tuna Potential Fishing Grounds in the Southeastern Indian Ocean
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - To maintain sustainable fisheries, albacore tuna is one of the commercial fish species whose management is regulated globally by the Regional Fisheries Management Organizations. Generally, sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (SSC) are used to determine fish suitability based on the catch data. In this research, we attempt to identify optimal habitats for albacore tuna in the southeastern Indian Ocean by analyzing in situ data based on onboard observers on tuna long line vessels from 2006-2019 and optimum interpolation sea surface temperature from NOAA-Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer and sea surface chlorophyll-a from Aqua MODIS satellites. The albacore tuna's habitat suitability index was examined using the generalized additive model. The results suggested that albacore tuna inhabited waters with an SST range of 15-26 degrees C and SSC concentration of 0.075-0.125 mg/m3. In the Indian Ocean, most albacore tunas were captured at higher latitudes of 20 degrees-30 degrees S.

TI  - Impact of Land Cover Changing on Wetland Surface Temperature Based on Multitemporal Remote Sensing Data
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) have been studied in recent years. Urban/rural planning, temperature analysis, and environmental monitoring can benefit from examining these variations. Land surface temperature (LST) has a great potential to act as a global indicator of the status of wetlands and changes in their hydrological and evapotranspiration regimes, which are often linked to land use and cover changes. Using remote sensing data, several studies have examined LULC changes on LST. This multi-temporal analysis used images from Landsat during 2005 to 2020. This study compares surface biophysical properties to sub-pixel heat changes. This result shows that LULC classes have different LST. Expansion of Oil Palm plantations decreases LST, while bare land and impervious surface increases it. The LST declined 3 degrees C (0.115 degrees C each year) over 20 years in the research area. This research provides information demonstrating how plantation growth from deforestation raises the surface temperature. Meanwhile, plantation from shrub and bareland decrease the surface temperature. The development of LST trend maps and time series charts on an operational basis give wetland managers with a fast and dependable single indicator of the effect of land processes on water and energy flows, allowing them to better managing their wetlands. Continuous monitoring of LULC dynamics is needed to design sustainable land use regulations for environmental preservation and regional economic development.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th International Conference on Machine Vision (ICMV)
CL  - Rome, ITALY
AB  - Deep learning models for computer vision in remote sensing such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has benefitted acceleration from the usage of multiple CPUs and GPUs. There are several ways to make the training stage more effective in terms of utilizing multiple cores at the same time by processing different image mini-batches with a duplicated model called Distributed Data Parallelization (DDP) and computing the parameters in a lower precision floating-point number called Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). We would like to investigate the impact of DDP and AMP training modes on the overall utilization and memory consumption of CPU and GPU, as well as the accuracy of a CNN model. The study is performed on the EuroSAT dataset, a Sentinel-2-based benchmark satellite image dataset for image classification of land covers. We compare training using 1 CPU, using DDP, and using both DDP and AMP over 100 epochs using ResNet-18 architecture. The hardware that we used are Intel Xeon Silver 4116 CPU with 24 cores and an NVIDIA v100 GPU. We find that although parallelization of CPUs or DDP takes less time to train on the images, it can take 50 MB more memory than using only a single CPU. The combination of DDP and AMP can release memory up to 160 MB and reduce computation time by 20 seconds. The test accuracy is slightly higher for both DDP and DDP-AMP at 90.61% and 90.77% respectively than without DDP and AMP at 89.84%. Hence, training using Distributed Data Parallelization (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) has more benefits in terms of lower GPU memory consumption, faster training execution time, faster convergence towards solutions, and finally, higher accuracy.

T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewThis article presents a critical review of the current literature to provide a brief update on the contemporary advances in diagnosing and managing N1 penile cancer.Recent findingsPenile squamous cell carcinoma (pSCC) has evolved from being an orphan field for cancer innovation. Advances in the understanding tumour biology have enabled sophisticated diagnostics and predictive modelling to better characterize inguinal disease. Minimally invasive inguinal lymph node dissection is emerging as a technique that reduces morbidity while maintaining oncological safety. Furthermore, robust clinical trials are underway ,which will provide level one evidence to guide treatment decisions. Exciting advances in the field of immune-oncology offer promise as adjuvant therapies. International collaboration and centralisation of care will be essential to driving translational research and equitable evidence-based care.Improving outcomes for men with pSCC remains a global challenge. Radical inguinal lymph node dissection remains the gold standard for diagnosing and curing N1 disease. Although many promising developments are on the horizon, high-level evidence is required to guide therapy.

TI  - Using sentinel nodes to evaluate changing connectivity in a protected area network.
T2  - PeerJ
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - It has been recognized that well-connected networks of protected areas are needed to halt the continued loss of global biodiversity. The recently signed Kunming-Montreal biodiversity agreement commits countries to protecting 30% of terrestrial lands in well-connected networks of protected areas by 2030. To meet these ambitious targets, land-use planners and conservation practitioners will require tools to identify areas important for connectivity and track future changes. In this study we present methods using circuit theoretic models with a subset of sentinel park nodes to evaluate connectivity for a protected areas network. We assigned a lower cost to natural areas within protected areas, under the assumption that animal movement within parks should be less costly given the regulation of activities. We found that by using mean pairwise effective resistance (MPER) as an indicator of overall network connectivity, we were able to detect changes in a parks network in response to simulated land-use changes. As expected, MPER increased with the addition of high-cost developments and decreased with the addition of new, low-cost protected areas. We tested our sentinel node method by evaluating connectivity for the protected area network in the province of Ontario, Canada. We also calculated a node isolation index, which highlighted differences in protected area connectivity between the north and the south of the province. Our method can help provide protected areas ecologists and planners with baseline estimates of connectivity for a given protected area network and an indicator that can be used to track changes in connectivity in the future.

AB  - Following the 2019 Ridgecrest (California) earthquake sequence, the Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) association deployed and coordinated a reconnaissance effort that included teams funded by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US Geological Survey (USGS), the California Geological Survey (CGS), and the US Navy to document ground failure that had occurred at China Lake, Searles Lake, and surrounding areas. At Searles Lake, the teams found locations with ejecta and locations without surface manifestation, although the reconnaissance was relatively rapid, and most areas around the lake were not observed. Accordingly, two other data sources have been considered to develop a more complete spatial representation of ground failure: (1) damage proxy maps (DPMs) based on the analysis of multi-epoch synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data; and (2) optical (visible and near-infrared) satellite images. The Searles Lake lakebed lacks vegetation and is relatively level in elevation, making it an ideal location for using the remote sensing data. We begin by training a machine learning algorithm using observations from a small area to detect the presence of ejecta from the optical satellite images. Subsequent testing of the algorithm using observations from a broader area showed reasonably good results, but with larger rates of misidentification than in the training data. The algorithm in combination with the direct observations are used to generate post-event maps of surface manifestation at the same resolution as the satellite images, which are being used to validate the DPMs to facilitate future applications for rapid post-event ground failure detection and loss estimation.

TI  - ON THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
T2  - IUS HUMANI-REVISTA DE DERECHO
M3  - Article
AB  - The Universal Declaration of Human Rights took place very shortly after the end of the Second World War and therefore emerged in a context that we associate with the dawn of the socalled Cold War. Almost seventy-five years after that date, the changes, often disruptive, have come on the back of what is known as the Digital Revolution, also called the Third Industrial Revolution or the Scientific and Technological Revolution, which includes the all-encompassing phenomenon of Globalization. The universalization of human rights may collide with other relativistic visions, such as interculturality or multiculturalism, for example. The commonly asserted characteristics of human rights, i.e., that they are objective, absolute, and unalienable, may not be conclusive. The note of diversity disseminated by bodies such as UNESCO makes this clear: the celebration of the World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development, organized by UNESCO every 21 May, highlights, in this sense, not only the richness of the world's cultures but also the essential role of intercultural dialogue in achieving peace and sustainable development without detracting from its economic value. In this context, how can we reconcile universality and diversity? And without abandoning the tolerance-dignity binomial, let us continue to ask ourselves whether the universality that is being proclaimed is intended to impose a markedly Western worldview.

TI  - Cropland expansion in Ecuador between 2000 and 2016.
T2  - PloS one
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We describe changes in the cropland distribution for physiographic and bioregions of continental Ecuador between 2000 and 2016 using Landsat satellite data and government statistics. The cloudy conditions in Ecuador are a major constraint to satellite data analysis. We developed a two-stage cloud filtering algorithm to create cloud-free multi-temporal Landsat composites that were used in a Random Forest model to identify cropland. The overall accuracy of the model was 78% for the Coast region, 86% for the Andes, and 98% for the Amazon region. Cropland density was highest in the coastal lowlands and in the Andes between 2500 and 4400 m. During this period, cropland expansion was most pronounced in the Paramo, Choco Tropical Rainforests, and Western Montane bioregions. There was no cropland expansion detected in the Eastern Foothill forests bioregion. The satellite data analysis further showed a small contraction of cropland (4%) in the Coast physiographic region, and cropland expansion in the Andes region (15%), especially above 3500m, and in the Amazon region (57%) between 2000 and 2016. The government data showed a similar contraction for the Coast (7%) but, in contrast with the satellite data, they showed a large agricultural contraction in the Andes (39%) and Amazon (50%). While the satellite data may be better at estimating relative change (trends), the government data may provide more accurate absolute numbers in some regions, especially the Amazon because separating pasture and tree crops from forest with satellite data is challenging. These discrepancies illustrate the need for careful evaluation and comparison of data from different sources when analyzing land use change.

TI  - Serological and Molecular evidence of pathogenic<i> Leptospira</i> species in cattle from slaughterhouses in Veracruz State, Mexico
T2  - REVISTA CIENTIFICA-FACULTAD DE CIENCIAS VETERINARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cattle raising is the most important livestock activity in Mexico, highlighting the fact that the Country is eight place worldwide in the production of bovine meat. However, cattle can be affected by leptospirosis (a bacterial disease caused by 17 species of spirochetes of the genus Leptospira), which cause reproductive problems that translate into great economic losses. Additionally, these zoonotic agents can cause a rapidly evolving febrile condition in humans, which can be solved after the first week of symptoms or could progress to develop a severe late-phase manifestations. Despite the great impact of these agents on the economy and Public Health, epidemiological surveillance against the infectious disease that cause is not present in municipal slaughterhouses (MS). Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify, using serological and molecular methods, the circulating Leptospira species in three MS in Veracruz State. The frequency of anti-Leptospira antibodies was 67.5%. Additionally, five sequences were recovered that were 99% similar to L. interrogans. This work represents the first national effort for the evaluation of MS as sentinel units, that allow establishing the diversity of species of the genus Leptospira that circulate in cattle and establishing intervention measures for workers risk mitigation, who come into contact with the fluids and organs of infected animals.

TI  - Preparing for the Next Influenza Season: Monitoring the Emergence and Spread of Antiviral Resistance
T2  - INFECTION AND DRUG RESISTANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The relaxation of pandemic restrictions in 2022 has led to a reemergence of respiratory virus circulation worldwide and anticipation of substantial influenza waves for the 2022/2023 Northern Hemisphere winter. Therefore, the antiviral susceptibility profiles of human influenza viruses circulating in Germany were characterized.Methods: Between October 2019 (week 40/2019) and March 2022 (week 12/2022), nasal swabs from untreated patients with acute respiratory symptoms were collected in the national German influenza surveillance system. A total of 598 influenza viruses were isolated and analyzed for susceptibility to oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir, using a neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay. In addition, next-generation sequencing was applied to assess molecular markers of resistance to NA, cap-dependent endonuclease (PA) and M2 ion channel inhibitors (NAI, PAI, M2I) in 367 primary clinical samples. Furthermore, a genotyping assay based on RT-PCR and pyrosequencing to rapidly assess the molecular resistance marker PA-I38X in PA genes was designed and established.Results: While NAI resistance in the strict sense, defined by a > 10-fold (influenza A) or >5-fold (influenza B) increase of NAI IC50, was not detected, a subtype A(H1N1)pdm09 isolate displayed 2.3-to 7.5-fold IC50 increase for all three NAI. This isolate carried the NA-S247N substitution, which is known to enhance NAI resistance induced by NA-H275Y. All sequenced influenza A viruses carried the M2-S31N substitution, which confers resistance to M2I. Of note, one A(H3N2) virus displayed the PA-I38M substitution, which is associated with reduced susceptibility to the PAI baloxavir marboxil. Pyrosequencing analysis confirmed these findings in the original clinical specimen and in cultured virus isolate, suggesting sufficient replicative fitness of this virus mutant.Conclusion: Over the last three influenza seasons, the vast majority of influenza viruses in this national-level sentinel were susceptible to NAIs and PAIs. These findings support the use of antivirals in the upcoming influenza season.

TI  - Design of a Dual-Polarization All-Metal Vivaldi Array Antenna Using a Metal 3D Printing Method for High-Power Jamming Systems
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an all-metal Vivaldi array antenna with a wide-angle impedance matching (WAIM) layer for high-power jamming systems. To reduce fabrication complexity and time, the proposed array antenna is manufactured using a metal 3D printing method. The Vivaldi unit cell, composed of a radiating flare part and an inner cavity, is extended into an 8 x 8 array with a +/- 45 degrees slant configuration. To further enhance the beam steering angle, the WAIM layer is placed on top of the proposed array antenna. The performances of the proposed array antenna, such as its active reflection coefficients (ARCs), gains, and array radiation patterns, are investigated in a full anechoic chamber. At a steering angle of (theta(0) = 45 degrees, phi(0) = 25), the measured and simulated average ARCs of the center element (Port 36) with the WAIM layer are -13.2 dB and -18.5 dB, respectively. At 4 GHz, the measured and simulated boresight gains of the proposed array antenna are 19 dBi and 20.6 dBi, respectively. In addition, the measured and simulated boresight gains for the (theta(0) = 45 degrees, phi(0) = 0 degrees) steering angle in the zx-plane are 18 dBi and 21 dBi, respectively. In the zy-plane, boresight gains for the (theta(0) = 45 degrees, phi(0) = 0 degrees) steering angle are 19.3 dBi by measurement and 19.1 dBi by simulation. These results demonstrate that the proposed array antenna is suitable for high-power jamming systems because stable boresight gains are observed even at wide steering angles without unwanted grating lobes.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 29th International Conference on MultiMedia Modeling (MMM)
CL  - Bergen, NORWAY
AB  - Deep learning methods are widely used in the domain of change detection in remote sensing images. While datasets of that kind are abundant, annotated images, specific for the task at hand, are still scarce. Neural networks trained with Self supervised learning aim to harness large volumes of unlabeled satellite high resolution images to help in finding better solutions for the change detection problem. In this paper we experiment with this approach by presenting 4 different change detection methodologies. We propose a fusion method that under specific parameters can provide better results. We evaluate our results using two openly available datasets with Sentinel-2 satellite images, S2MTCP and OSCD, and we investigate the impact of using 2 different Sentinel 2 band combinations on our final predictions. Finally we conclude by summarizing the benefits of this approach as well as we propose future areas of interest that could be of value in enhancing the change detection task's outcomes.

TI  - Monitoring of millimeter-scale deformations in Tallinn using repeated leveling and PS-InSAR analysis of Sentinel-1 data
T2  - ADVANCES IN GEODESY AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate millimeter-scale deformations in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, by using repeated leveling data and the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of Sentinel-1 satellite mission. The persistent scattered interferometric SAR (PS-InSAR) analysis of images from ascending and descending orbits from June 2016 to November 2021 resulted the line-of-sight (LOS) displacement velocities in the Tallinn city center. Velocity solutions were estimated for the full period of time, but also for shorter peri-ods to monitor deformation changes in yearly basis. The gridded LOS velocity models were used for the decomposition of east-west and vertical velocities. Additionally, the uncertainty of 2D velocity solutions was estimated by following the propagation of uncertainty. The 3D velocity of permanent GNSS station "MUS2" in Tallinn was used to unify the reference of all PS-InSAR velocity solutions. The results of the latest leveling in Tallinn city center in 2007/2008 and 2019 showed rather small subsidence rates which were in agreement with InSAR long-term solution. However, the short-term InSAR velocity solutions revealed larger subsidence of city center with a rate about -10 mm/yr in 2016-2017, and the uplift around 5 mm/yr in 2018-2019 with relatively stable periods in 2017-2018 and 2019-2021. The inclusion of groundwater level observation data and the geological mapping information into the analysis revealed possible spatiotemporal correlation between the InSAR results and the groundwater level variations over the deep valleys buried under quaternary sediments.

TI  - ABSTRACT-AN IMPROVED MAPPING OF BURNED AREAS IN ALTO MINHO (NORTHWESTERN PORTUGAL) BETWEEN 2001 AND 2020
T2  - FINISTERRA-REVISTA PORTUGUESA DE GEOGRAFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Alto Minho is a region of northern Portugal in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, which is one of the regions in Europe where fires are more frequent. The historical mapping of burned areas has been fundamental to characterize the fire regime and to determine wildfire prevention policies and urban planning measures. Over the last decades, several studies have been published seeking to characterize the impact of fire on the territory, its frequency and recurrence, based on the official cartography, provided by the Instituto de Conservacao da Natureza e das Florestas - ICNF. In this study, a detailed and rigorous cartography of the areas affected by fires in the Alto Minho area in the last two decades (2001 to 2020) was developed. These areas were determined based on the analysis of 400 images from the Landsat 5 (TM), Land -sat 7 (ETM+), Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager - OLI) and Sentinel-2 (Multispectral Instrument - MSI) satellites, whose perimeters resulted from manual digitizing supported by historical series of orthophotos. A total of 12 692 fire perimeters were digitalized corres-ponding to 235 060 hectares of burned area in the Alto Minho region. These results substan-tially differ from the official cartographic information, in terms of cartographic accuracy, number of fire perimeters (3873) and burned area (179 283 hectares).

TI  - Erosion of four Brazilian coastal deltas: how dam construction is changing the natural pattern of coastal sedimentary systems
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoir-building on rivers is still "the Brazilian energy culture", such that many other dams are being constructed and planned, with many other rivers potentially suffering the same impact in their sediment flux. In this study, we evaluated the impacts of reservoir-building on the erosion of the Sao Francisco, Jequitinhonha, Doce, and Paraiba do Sul river deltas. A time series of Landsat images from 1973 to 2020 was analyzed, with three key highlighted moments (1973, 1997 and 2020) that summarize the erosion processes on these deltas. In addition to the images, continuous river water discharge, sediment discharge and basin rainfall data were analyzed between 1940 and 2020, providing river parameters over a period exceeding that of the satellite data. The findings suggest that coastal erosion has progressed in the four deltas, with higher estimated losses in the Sao Francisco and Paraiba do Sul over the 47 years of available satellite images. However, despite minimal overall estimated gains, the Jequitinhonha and Doce experienced high erosion at their river mouths, as in the other two rivers, compensated by accretion in distal coastal areas. These results can be explained by reductions in river flux and consequent sediment transport capacity due to reservoirs.

TI  - Building Height Reconstruction Based on Propagator and Generalized Maximum Entropy-TomoSAR
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR) technique is becoming an increasingly hot research topic in the 3-D reconstruction of the structure of urban buildings. The robustness of the many advanced nonparametric spectral estimation methods in use is based on a high number of observations. This letter aims to evaluate the ability of the five nonparametric estimator techniques, including propagator, generalized maximum entropy (GME), minimum norm (MN), singular value decomposition (SVD), and Capon in the separation of scattering contributions with a small number of SAR images. The performance comparison of the employed algorithms is carried out on the simulated and real datasets. The study results show that the novel high-resolution propagator and GME estimators, respectively, based on the partitioning and extrapolation of the covariance matrix, can discriminate the number of scatterers in one azimuth-range resolution and satisfactorily prevent the appearance of undesirable sidelobes. The experimental results on real SAR images acquired by the TerraSAR-X satellite show the proposed propagator spectral estimation can significantly improve the 3-D building reconstruction in the urban environment. Also, the estimated height of the scatters using the propagator technique is similar to the data obtained from ground observations.

TI  - Remote Sensing in Field Crop Monitoring: A Comprehensive Review of Sensor Systems, Data Analyses and Recent Advances
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The key elements that underpin food security require the adaptation of agricultural systems to support productivity increases while minimizing inputs and the adverse effects of climate change. The advances in precision agriculture over the past few years have substantially enhanced the efficiency of applying spatially variable agronomic inputs for irrigation, such as fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and water, and we can attribute them to the increasing number of innovations that utilize new technologies that are capable of monitoring field crops for varying spatial and temporal changes. Remote sensing technology is the primary driver of success in precision agriculture, along with other technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), robotic systems, weather forecasting technology, and global positioning systems (GPSs). More specifically, multispectral imaging (MSI) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) have made the monitoring of the field crop health to aid decision making and the application of spatially and temporally variable agronomic inputs possible. Furthermore, the fusion of remotely sensed multisource data-for instance, HSI and LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data fusion-has even made it possible to monitor the changes in different parts of an individual plant. To the best of our knowledge, in most reviews on this topic, the authors focus on specific methods and/or technologies, with few or no comprehensive reviews that expose researchers, and especially students, to the vast possible range of remote sensing technologies used in agriculture. In this article, we describe/evaluate the remote sensing (RS) technologies for field crop monitoring using spectral imaging, and we provide a thorough and discipline-specific starting point for researchers of different levels by supplying sufficient details and references. We also high light strengths and drawbacks of each technology, which will help readers select the most appropriate method for their intended uses.

AB  - This is a replication dataset for the manuscript titled: "" submitted to Wellcome Open Research. Coastal Kenya has experienced repeated outbreaks of DENV and CHIKV, and cases of microcephaly have also been reported. Despite the Arboviral burden, there is lack of systematic entomological surveillance. This study collected Aedes aegypti from different sites in coastal Kenya and characterized the viruses circulating in these mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were collected using BG-Sentinel traps, and pools comprised of female Aedes aegypti only generated. The resultant mosquito pools were then screened for presence of arboviruses using RT-PCR and then sequenced using a meta genomics approach to identify other viruses circulating in them. The mosquito collection dataset highlights the geographical location names and their respective geographical position coordinates (GPS) coordinates whereas the RT-PCR dataset describes arbovirus presence or absence findings. The mosquito collection dataset was key in generating a map showing sampling sites, while the RT-PCR dataset informed the mosquito pools to prioritise for sequencing.

TI  - Socially Engaged Protest Arts: Metaphors of Subtlety and Aggressiveness in Select Arts of Ganiyu Jimoh and EB Mike Asukwo
T2  - AGATHOS-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficacy, messages and aesthetic value in a socially-engaged art depend on a number of variables such as the artist's creative vision, skill, inclination, worldview, emotional disposition, and agenda. Similarly, the audience/beholders' meaning-making and contextualization trajectories are in many ways attributable to their interpretive competence which are enabled by the variables listed for the artist. In this study, our focus is to provide a clear description of what 'socially -engaged art' and a 'protest art' denote, and how the designated arts of EB Mike Asukwo and Ganiyu Jimoh fall within each interpretation. In addition, this study seeks to deepen understanding of the dimensions of creative application of 'subtlety' and 'aggressiveness' as artistic metaphors in select protest cartoons by Asukwo and Jimoh. This study utilizes interpretive analysis to provide plausible insight into the embedding of metaphors in a cartoon in conjunction with applicable communication theories of art, to elucidate the kind of information the beholders can draw. In the end, this paper provides logical collocation behind the classification of the designated cartoons by Asukwo and Jimoh as 'socially -engaged cartoons' and 'protest cartoons', and how some variables influence the shades of meaning and message both artists infuse in the selected works.

T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Complexity sets the subject perspective of many modern works in various fields of knowledge: from biology, ecology and programming, to theology and medicine. This paper offers an understanding of the basic problems of the formation of a discourse about the complex, identifying the features of the conceptualization of complexity in domestic and foreign philosophy. Domestic and foreign studies of complexity come to the conclusion that complexity is poorly amenable to conceptual representation. Complexity can be understood as an epiphenomenon, a kind of worldview, a meta-principle, an aggregate, a problem requiring a solution. "Growth points" of ideas about complexity, which can be described as a kind of model of its conceptualization, have been found. Metaphysical, analytical, systemic, synergetic, network, socio-cultural, anthropocultural models of conceptualization of complexity can be distinguished. Such typologization is complementary; it reflects some features in the explication of complexity, which takes place within the framework of modern research. Domestic and foreign thinkers pose similar questions about the nature of complexity. Both in domestic and foreign studies, the polysemanticism of the phenomenon of complexity is noted, similar strategies of explication of complexity are outlined, its types and forms of representation are distinguished. Both domestic and foreign traditions of complexity research pay special attention to the systemic characteristics of complexity, its heuristic value for understanding socio-cultural transformations is noted. The heuristic value of postmodernism and structuralism in understanding complex systems of very different nature is noted. Domestic studies of complexity pay more attention to the ontologization of this phenomenon, its metaphysical features, while foreign studies more often pay attention to the problems of integrating complexity into scientific research.

TI  - Analysis-ready satellite data mosaics from Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - Today's enormous amounts of freely available high-resolution satellite imagery provide the de-mand for effective preprocessing methods. One such preprocessing method needed in many appli-cations utilizing optical satellite imagery from the Landsat and Sentinel-2 archives is mosaicking. Merging hundreds of single scenes into a single satellite data mosaic before conducting analysis such as land cover classification, change detection, or modelling is often a prerequisite. Main-taining the original data structure and preserving metadata for further modelling or classification would be advantageous for many applications. Furthermore, in other applications, e.g., connected to land cover classification creating the mosaic for a specific period matching the phenological state of the phenomena in nature would be beneficial. In addition, supporting in-house and com-puting centers not directly connected to a specific cloud provider could be a requirement for some institutions or companies. In the current work, we present a method called Geomosaic that meets these criteria and produces analysis-ready satellite data mosaics from Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery.center dot The method described produces analysis-ready satellite data mosaics.center dot The satellite data mosaics contain pixel metadata usable for further analysis.center dot The algorithm is available as an open-source tool coded in Python and can be used on multiple platforms.

TI  - Sandy beach area estimation through open access satellite information: A calibration for the coast of Montevideo, Uruguay
T2  - Boletin de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeras
M3  - Article
AB  - Sandy beaches provide a variety of ecosystem services that support human well-being at coastal areas. These ecosystems are highly dynamic and primarily defined by the interaction between waves, tides and wind regimes. High variability makes beaches vulnerable to physical modifications and climate change, jeopardizing ecosystems functions. This has resulted in accelerated erosion rates and ecological degradation with widespread socioeconomic implications. Coastal dynamic analysis is a data demanding process that requires long term monitoring programs; this study applies an open access methodology to the Landsat collection in order to estimate beach area. This informative variable can help elucidate coastal dynamics, ecosystem attributes and touristic potential. Sand (through Random forest classification) and vegetation (through a threshold of the normalized difference vegetation index) were considered as components of the beach ecosystem. The method was calibrated for the Montevideo coast by testing results against independent estimations of beach area, the area of 20 beaches of the Montevideo coast was estimated for a 35 years' period. This methodology can be applied anywhere at a very low operational cost, potentially multiplying the available information and allowing better management on the pressing matters of coastal dynamics and sandy beach use.

TI  - PERFORMANCE OF RAINFALL AND SOIL MOISTURE SATELLITE PRODUCTS ON A SMALL CATCHMENT IN CENTRAL ITALY
T2  - ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable rainfall and soil moisture data is crucial to investigate hydrogeological processes at the catchment scale (runoff, soil erosion, infiltration, etc.). The present study aims to evaluate the performance of several high-resolution satellite products (IMERG GPM, SM2RAIN, Copernicus Sentinel-1 SSM1km, and SMAP L2_SM_SP) that can support hydrological studies in areas with a lack of ground-based data. The analysis was carried out in a small low permeability catchment in Central Italy (Tatarena basin), equipped with three rain gauge stations. The basin is scarcely anthropized and can be considered representative of many catchments with different soil cover, from forest to farming. The satellite rainfall products were analysed using probability plots, the double mass method, statistical tests and three categorical scores. Satellite soil moisture data were tested with the Hydrological Consistency Index, aiming to verify the consistency between soil moisture satellite data and precipitation. The results show that the IMERG GPM rainfall dataset performs better than SM2RAIN at different time scales. Despite some uncertainties, the Copernicus Sentinel-1 SSM1km proved to be the best-performing soil moisture satellite dataset. Results may be useful for using satellite data to understand runoff processes in poorly instrumented basins.

TI  - A Scalable Earth Observation Service to Map Land Cover in Geomorphological Complex Areas beyond the Dynamic World: An Application in Aosta Valley (NW Italy)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation services guarantee continuous land cover mapping and are becoming of great interest worldwide. The Google Earth Engine Dynamic World represents a planetary example. This work aims to develop a land cover mapping service in geomorphological complex areas in the Aosta Valley in NW Italy, according to the newest European EAGLE legend starting in the year 2020. Sentinel-2 data were processed in the Google Earth Engine, particularly the summer yearly median composite for each band and their standard deviation with multispectral indexes, which were used to perform a k-nearest neighbor classification. To better map some classes, a minimum distance classification involving NDVI and NDRE yearly filtered and regularized stacks were computed to map the agronomical classes. Furthermore, SAR Sentinel-1 SLC data were processed in the SNAP to map urban and water surfaces to improve optical classification. Additionally, deep learning and GIS updated datasets involving urban components were adopted beginning with an aerial orthophoto. GNSS ground truth data were used to define the training and the validation sets. In order to test the effectiveness of the implemented service and its methodology, the overall accuracy was compared to other approaches. A mixed hierarchical approach represented the best solution to effectively map geomorphological complex areas to overcome the remote sensing limitations. In conclusion, this service may help in the implementation of European and local policies concerning land cover surveys both at high spatial and temporal resolutions, empowering the technological transfer in alpine realities.

TI  - A Possible Land Cover EAGLE Approach to Overcome Remote Sensing Limitations in the Alps Based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2: The Case of Aosta Valley (NW Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover (LC) maps are crucial to environmental modeling and define sustainable management and planning policies. The development of a land cover mapping continuous service according to the new EAGLE legend criteria has become of great interest to the public sector. In this work, a tentative approach to map land cover overcoming remote sensing (RS) limitations in the mountains according to the newest EAGLE guidelines was proposed. In order to reach this goal, the methodology has been developed in Aosta Valley, NW of Italy, due to its higher degree of geomorphological complexity. Copernicus Sentinel-1 and 2 data were adopted, exploiting the maximum potentialities and limits of both, and processed in Google Earth Engine and SNAP. Due to SAR geometrical distortions, these data were used only to refine the mapping of urban and water surfaces, while for other classes, composite and timeseries filtered and regularized stack from Sentinel-2 were used. GNSS ground truth data were adopted, with training and validation sets. Results showed that K-Nearest-Neighbor and Minimum Distance classification permit maximizing the accuracy and reducing errors. Therefore, a mixed hierarchical approach seems to be the best solution to create LC in mountain areas and strengthen local environmental modeling concerning land cover mapping.

T2  - PHYSIO-GEO
M3  - Article
AB  - The study area, with its extensive wetlands, belongs to the Ramsar site 1018, which was inscribed in 2000 and was classified as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2020. The reconstruction of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the land cover will enable the analysis of changes over time and the prediction of future changes in a perspective of sustainable conservation initiatives. Landsat images from 1990, 2005 and 2020 were subjected to supervised classification using remote sensing and GIS techniques. The resulting data were combined to establish transition matrices to assess the conversion rates of the different land use classes. Future land use changes up to 2035 were simulated using the Land Change Modeler.The results obtained indicate that in 1990, 70.9% of the site was covered by spontaneous vegetation formations (shrub and tree savannahs, dense and gallery forests, swamp formations). Their share fell to 61.6% in 2005 and to 53.6% in 2020, which represents a loss of 24.4% in relative terms over a 30- year period.The scenario developed for the future shows that spontaneous formations will still be slightly dominant (52.2% of the total area), while the largest areas will remain equally occupied by swamp formations and by fields and fallow land (24.4%). However, this information must be taken with caution.Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)

AB  - Meteorological satellites are widely used for collecting information about the atmosphere. Due to the indirect relation between satellite data and measurements of meteorological parameters, mathematical models, especially those based on artificial intelligence, have been developed for meteorological modeling. Indeed, in recent years, machine learning has enabled fundamental advances in the modeling of random systems. In this context, we will show the contribution of techniques based on artificial intelligence in the estimation of precipitation. Based on the expertise of our research laboratories in this field, the objective of this paper is to present our recent results and developments using machine learning, such as ANN, SVM, and RF. For the classification and estimation of rainfall intensities, satellite images were used for the implementation of these techniques. The training and validation was carried out by comparing the satellite images to the corresponding radar images. The results of these artificial intelligence-based techniques indicate very interesting performance.

TI  - Machine Learning Algorithms for Satellite Image Classification Using Google Earth Engine and Landsat Satellite Data: Morocco Case Study
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation data have proven to be a valuable resource of quantitative information that is more consistent in time and space than traditional land-based surveys. Remote sensing plays a vital role in collecting data in many aspects of life, whether scientific, economic, or political. Land cover information is very important in supporting urban planning and decision-making and provides many opportunities for mapping and monitoring urban areas. Multiple data sources exist, including satellite data of different resolutions ranging from very high to medium resolution and aerial and drone image acquisitions. Today, accurate land cover information is in high demand. Using satellite imagery and remote sensing techniques for planning and development is becoming a common study conducted by many researchers to find practical solutions to the many problems affecting our planet. The recovery, management, and analysis of these large amounts of satellite imagery pose considerable challenges. The classification of satellite images is a very popular and complex topic. In classification studies over the last decade, researchers have been frequently studying only those three machine learning algorithms RF, CART, and SVM, applied in cities or countries except Morocco which poses a great lack of information on the land use of Morocco. To solve these challenges, six machine learning algorithms were applied and compared to each other based on several evaluation metrics, and then, to avoid the problems of data download and storage space, we used Google Earth Engine, a geospatial processing platform that operates in the cloud. It provides free access to substantial satellite data and free computations to monitor, visualize, and analyze environmental features at the petabyte scale. In this paper, we used Landsat 8 satellite data to perform a land cover classification of Morocco, applying machine learning algorithms, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. This paper proposes an experimental study of six supervised machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Minimum Distance (MD), Decision Tree (DT) and Gradient Tree (GTB), to classify the water areas, built-up areas, cultivated areas, sandy areas, barren areas and forest areas on the Moroccan territory to deduce at the end the best-performing classifier which has higher accuracy. The classification results are displayed using a set of accuracy indicators, including overall accuracy (OA), Kappa, user accuracy (UA), and producer accuracy (PA). We obtained the best accuracy of 0.93 for the minimum distance (MD) algorithm, but the worst result is 0.74 for the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. To improve these results, we added different indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference accumulation index (NDBI), bare soil index (BSI), and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI). In general, the addition of these indices improves accuracy. When comparing these classifiers before and after the addition of these indices, Minimum Distance yields nearly 93% better accuracy. Therefore, we conclude that it was the best-performing classifier among the other classifiers that can quickly produce more accurate land cover maps, especially for hard-to-reach areas.

T2  - Chronic stress (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Cognitive appraisals play a fundamental role in mental health outcomes following exposure to trauma. Appraisals influence emotional reactions, coping responses, and adaptation to stress and represent a modifiable factor that can serve as a central focus for intervention. Most studies have primarily focused on the role of dysfunctional cognitions in the persistence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this study, we extend research in this area by investigating the role of problem-solving appraisal, an adaptive cognitive strategy, in the association between stress and PTSD.Methods: A total of 322 participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale, the problem-solving inventory (PSI), and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. Descriptive statistics were generated, and intercorrelations and mediation analysis were performed.Results: Problem-solving confidence and personal control partially mediated the relationship between stress and PTSD. However, contrary to existing research, the approach-avoidance style, which is a subscale of the PSI, did not mediate the relationship between these variables.Conclusion: Interventions for PTSD should incorporate a complementary focus on developing and increasing adaptive cognitions pertaining to personal control and confidence in problem-solving abilities. This could potentially form part of a broader process of rebuilding the individual's cognitive worldview following exposure to trauma.

AB  - To match the ever increasing nutrition needs of growing population and dwindling agricultural labour force, agriculture sector has been progressively adapting farming practices with major technological interventions. Discrimination of different types of crops is a common requirement for mechanized crop management which includes tasks such as identifying pests, predicting crop yield etc. High resolution remote sensing data has been extensively used for various agricultural applications. Supervised classification has been the method of choice for crop discrimination in high resolution multispectral imagery. Considering the increasing complexity of agricultural lands wherein the co-occurrence of a host of crops and other urban landscape features is a common scenario evolved, classification of high resolution multispectral imagery using traditional supervised approaches is fraught with ambiguities and may lead to site-specific. We have explored the potential of high resolution multispectral satellite imagery (CARTOSAT-2D) for classifying horticultural crops under a complex landscape composition (rice, sugarcane, coconut, arecanut, forest, fallow land, urban, and water body) in Shivmogga region of Karnataka. Based on the selective ground truth data augmentation from implementing two traditional machine learning algorithms, we have adopted two popular deep learning (DL) network architectures: CNN based U-net and Seg net for the regional level classification of crops under complex agricultural settings. Validation of the results with independent ground truth data indicates fairly good accuracy of about 89 percent from the DL methods implemented. However, the accuracy of the results from the Random Forest algorithm is also competitive (about 80 percent) indicating the continued relevance of traditional ML models to crop classification at regional level.

TI  - Use of Remotely Sensed Data for the Evaluation of Inter-Row Cover Intensity in Vineyards
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on vegetation cover and soil management is used in hydrological and soil erosion modeling, but in most cases, reference values are used solely based on land use classification without considering the actual spatial and temporal variation adopted at the field scale. This work focused on the adoption of satellite optical data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 (S2) mission to evaluate both spatial and temporal variations of vineyard ground cover. First, on a wider scale, fields were mapped by photointerpretation, and a cluster analysis was carried out. Results suggest that vineyards can be classified according to different inter-row soil management, with the best results obtained using NDVI and NDWI. A pilot area in the municipality of Carpeneto, in the wine-growing area of Alto Monferrato, was also analyzed due to the availability of reference data on inter-row vegetation cover from experimental plots. Those are set on sloping areas and present different inter-row soil managements (conventional tillage-CT, and permanent grass cover-GC). Time series of different vegetation indices (VIs) have been obtained, and both S2 native bands and the derived VIs were evaluated to assess their capability of describing the vineyard's inter-row coverage growth trends at plot level for the agrarian year 2017-2018. Results suggest that a seasonality effect may be involved in the choice of the most suitable band or index that better describes soil coverage development at a given moment of the year. Further studies on open-source remotely sensed (RS) data could provide specific inputs for applications in erosion risk management and crop modeling.

TI  - Using Artificial Neural Networks to Couple Satellite C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry and Alpine3D Numerical Model for the Estimation of Snow Cover Extent, Height, and Density
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a new approach for the estimation of snow extent, height, and density in complex orography regions, which combines differential interferometric synthetic-aperture-radar (DInSAR) data and snowpack numerical model data through artificial neural networks (ANNs). The estimation method, subdivided into classification and estimation, is based on two ANNs trained by a DInSAR response model coupled with Alpine3D snow cover numerical model outputs. Auxiliary satellite training data from satellite visible-infrared MODIS imager as well as digital elevation and land cover models are used to discriminate wet and dry snow areas. For snow cover classification the ANN-based estimation methodology is combined with fuzzy-logic and compared with a consolidated decision threshold approach using C-band SAR backscattering information. For snow height (SH) and density estimation, the proposed methodology is compared with an analytical inverse method and two model-based statistical techniques (linear regression and maximum likelihood). The validation is carried out in Central Apennines, a mountainous area in Italy with an extension of about 104 km(2) and peaks up to 2912 m, using in situ data collected between December 2018 and February 2019. Results show that the ANN-based technique has a snow cover area classification accuracy of more than 80% when compared MODIS maps. Estimation bias and root mean square error are equal to about 0.5 cm and 20 cm for SH and to 5 kg/m(3) and 80 kg/m(3) for snow density. As expected, worse results are associated with low DInSAR coherence between two repeat passes and snow melting periods.

M3  - Review
AB  - The outer planets of our Solar System display a myriad of interesting cloud features, of different colors and sizes. The differences between the types of observed clouds suggest a complex interplay between the dynamics and chemistry at play in these atmospheres. Particularly, the stark difference between the banded structures of Jupiter and Saturn vs. the sporadic clouds on the ice giants highlights the varieties in dynamic, chemical and thermal processes that shape these atmospheres. Since the early explorations of these planets by spacecrafts, such as Voyager and Voyager 2, there are many outstanding questions about the long-term stability of the observed features. One hypothesis is that the internal heat generated during the formation of these planets is transported to the upper atmosphere through latent heat release from convecting clouds (i.e., moist convection). In this review, we present evidence of moist convective activity in the gas giant atmospheres of our Solar System from remote sensing data, both from ground- and space-based observations. We detail the processes that drive moist convective activity, both in terms of the dynamics as well as the microphysical processes that shape the resulting clouds. Finally, we also discuss the effects of moist convection on shaping the large-scale dynamics (such as jet structures on these planets).

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: After a period of theoretical investigation and practical implementation in the realm of political and ideological education, an optimal educational system has been established. The primary objective of political and ideological education in higher education institutions is to facilitate the cultivation of a constructive worldview and the reinforcement of students' spiritual underpinnings. However, there is a noticeable disparity in the attention given to mental health awareness (MHE), as fewer courses are dedicated to this aspect. Extensive research has been conducted; however, it has been conducted in a manner that neglects the interdependence of the variables under investigation and the significance of their collaborative functioning. Proposed: The integration paradigm of political and ideological education and mental health education is addressed by the introduction of a Bayesian optimisation with bidirectional long-term memory (BO-BLSTM). The BO-BLSTM model suggested in this study aims to specifically target the recognition and classification of a wide range of political sentiments. Methods: This study proposes the utilisation of a Bayesian optimisation with bidirectional long-term memory (BO-BLSTM) within the framework of integrating political and ideological education with mental health education. The objective of the BO-BLSTM model is to discern the diverse categories of political sentiments that are present. Conclusion: The application of the Bayesian Optimisation (BO) technique allows for the optimisation of hyperparameters in the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) model. Through comprehensive experimentation, it has been established that the BO-BLSTM model exhibits superior performance compared to existing approaches.(c) 2023 Ani Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Semisupervised Cross Domain Teacher-Student Mutual Training for Damaged Building Detection
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of damaged buildings is a form of object detection and is essential for disaster emergency response efforts. In recent years, deep learning has been widely used in object detection, with successful target detection models such as Faster-Rcnn and You Only Look Once (YOLO) being proposed. However, training deep learning models usually requires a large amount of labeled data. Due to the high threshold for aerial remote sensing data collection, labeled aerial data of collapsed buildings is very sparse. In addition, the limited area of damage in a single scene leads to insufficient feature diversity, which can easily lead to model overfitting. These issues restrict the development of deep learning in emergency response applications. To solve these problems, we propose a paradigm named cross-domain teacher-student mutual training. By using the Cycle-GAN-generated style transfer data through teacher network, pseudolabels are generated to train the student network. Then, the student network slowly updates the parameters of the teacher network to indirectly learn the generalization information of the satellite data domain. Networks trained in this way can achieve good results in detecting collapsed houses in aviation and satellite data. We tested the results on our self-built dataset, DB-ARSD, which includes bounding box labeling of the damaged buildings, and found that our method outperforms other object detection methods in both collapsed house prediction accuracy and domain transfer generalization performance.

TI  - Geological Mapping via Convolutional Neural Network Based on Remote Sensing and Geochemical Survey Data in Vegetation Coverage Areas
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological mapping in vegetation coverage areas is a challenging task. In this article, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed for geological mapping in a vegetation coverage area based on remote sensing images and geochemical survey data. The Gram-Schmidt fusion technology was first applied to fuse Sentinel-2A and ASTER remote sensing images to enhance the spatial resolution and enrich spectral information of remote sensing data. The fused remote sensing images were then organically integrated with geochemical survey data according to the correlations between the geochemical element contents and spectral reflectance of the objects. A case study of mapping six lithologic units in Jilinbaolige, Inner Mongolia, China was implemented using a CNN model based on the fused data. The classification map obtained an overall accuracy of 83.0%, which exhibited a better performance in contrast to random forest model. The results showed that CNNs can take full advantage of the spatial features of fused data and solve the problems of the "salt and pepper phenomenon" against the shallow machine learning algorithms, and the fusion of remote sensing and geochemical data can provide rich diagnostic information for geological mapping.

TI  - Application of remote sensing techniques to deal with scale aspects of GRACE data to quantify groundwater levels
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater has become an indispensable source of irrigation and drinking water. Industrial dependence on groundwater has also increased drastically. This has led to the rapid exploitation of groundwater. There is accelerating concern about the depletion of groundwater water levels and the deterioration of groundwater quality due to geogenic and anthropogenic causes. The availability of groundwater data is a huge concern, as it requires both time and capital. GRACE satellite project has become a very important tool for groundwater data access. The latest version of GRACE data provides terrestrial water storage, which is the sum of surface and groundwater. The present study details the method to access GRACE satellite data and prepare a spatial map for analysis. It also discusses how to handle data at different resolutions to quantify meaningful correlations. Further, groundwater data is correlated with nitrate data (both are at different grid resolutions) to throw light on the relationship between the important anthropogenic contaminant (nitrate) and groundwater levels. This provides insights into the linkage of quantity with quality. In brief, the important contributions of the paper are:& BULL; To provide the methodology to access GRCAE data and prepare spatial maps.& BULL; To handle the variables at different grid resolutions.& BULL; To correlate two GIS maps at different spatial resolutions. quality and quantity are significantly compromised [5] . Climate change has further triggered an increase in hydroclimatic extremes frequency [2,4] . The major issue regarding groundwater research is the accessibility of the data. Data collection requires an investment of time and capital. The government agencies in India like CGWB (Central Ground Water Board) and CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) collect the data at the district level but the sampling frequency is less (3 times a year). They conduct pre-monsoon and post-monsoon sampling. The present GRACE mission provides continuous data (0.5m x 0.5m scale). Data is at the monthly scale and have a good temporal resolution. With the rapid advancement in the field of remote sensing and increasing availability of satellite data in the open domain, researchers are correlating quantity with quality. The present work demonstrates the methods to access GRACE data (available for download in NetCDF file format) and convert it into GIS files (vector and raster) and the convenient excel format. In brief, the important contributions of the paper are:& BULL; To provide the methodology to access GRCAE data and prepare spatial maps & BULL; To handle the variables at different grid resolutions.& BULL; To correlate two GIS maps at different spatial resolutions.

TI  - Prediction and monitoring of LULC shift using cellular automata-artificial neural network in Jumar watershed of Ranchi District, Jharkhand
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Jumar watershed of Ranchi district is agrarian in nature. The unplanned and exponentially growing urban sprawl has become one of the probable threats in achieving sustainable development goals (SDG-15). The purpose of this research study is to monitor the urban sprawl in Jumar watershed within three decades i.e. from the year 1990 to 2021. Land use land cover (LULC) change has been monitored using satellite data from LANDSAT (4, 5 and 8). Various indices are calculated like normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalised difference built-up index (NDBI), normalised difference water index (NDWI) and built-up index (BUI) to monitor LULC change in the area. For prediction of urban sprawl, cellular automata and artificial neural network (CA-ANN) with GIS application technique is used. The model is validated by using Kappa coefficient. The prediction results showed increase in built-up area by 8.23 sq. km in the next decade. The built-up and barren land together increase up to 42.85 sq. km by 2030 and 34.61 sq. km in 2021. The NDVI for 3-decade period showed significant decrease in the healthy vegetation and increase in sparse vegetation. The NDBI showed a slight increase in urban area but massive increase in uncultivated and barren land. NDWI showed a decrease in area of the surface water. The LULC studies showed a major shift from healthy vegetation to agriculture and then to barren land. To assess the impact of urbanisation on water quality, water samples are taken seasonally from J1 to J11 sampling locations and are analysed as per APHA procedure. The sites are classified as urban, semi urban and rural area as per their location. The water quality index (WQI) varied between 42.14 to 61.42 during pre-monsoon, 62.20 to 68.7995 during monsoon and 43.48 to 60.12 during post-monsoon. The quality of water is found poor in all seasons at all sampling sites. The water is found highly turbid and alkaline throughout the year. Overall, it can be concluded that the water needs to be pre-treated for drinking purposes throughout the year.

TI  - Multiwater Index Synergistic Monitoring of Typical Wetland Water Bodies in the Arid Regions of West-Central Ningxia over 30 Years
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Shapotou National Nature Reserve in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is a typical arid region in China. There is an exceptionally serious problem of surface water resource conservation, and dynamic monitoring of surface water with the help of water indices can help to elucidate its change patterns and impact mechanisms. Here, we analysed the characteristics of interannual variation in surface water area in the study area from 1992-2021. The correlation coefficients of the surface water area in the previous year and the contemporaneous water bodies of the Yellow River with the total surface water area (TSWA) were calculated. The results show the following: (1) In terms of the classification accuracy of the two methods, water indices and support vector machine classification, water indices are more suitable for water body extraction in the study area. In particular, the three water indices, NDWI, MNDWI and AWEIsh, were more effective, with average overall accuracies of 90.38%, 90.33% and 90.36% over the 30-year period, respectively. (2) From the TSWA extraction results from the last 30 years, the TSWA showed an increasing trend with an increase of 368.28 hm(2). Among the areas, Tenggeli Lake contributed the most to the increase in TSWA. (3) The highest correlation between the TSWA and the previous year's TSWA was 0.89, indicating that the better way to protect the water body is to maintain water surface stability year-round. The surface water area of the Yellow River and TSWA also showed a strong correlation, indicating that the rational use of Yellow River water is also an important direction for the future conservation of water resources in the study area.

TI  - Epic Toponyms as Carriers of a Linguocultural Code
T2  - EURASIAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the cultural meaning of names denoting places such as mountains, water objects, and settlements. The study drew evidence from a famous Kazakh epos, Kozy Korpesh - Bayan Sulu, to provide insight into how epic toponyms contribute to the explication of culture. The study addressed the motives and methods of the linguistic and anthropological interpretation of toponyms, paying special attention to explicitly encoded cultural values. The study adopted a qualitative research approach based on a combination of secondary approaches - linguoculturological, intensive topology and holistic etymology involving linguistic etymology, folk etymology, and perceptual etymology. The data was collected in the form of connotations and denotations which each epic toponym represented in the poem. The findings show that, based on their etymological origin, epic toponyms belonged to two major groups: one, toponyms named after certain features of the landscape; and second, toponyms named after certain events in the epos. The former toponyms are transparent and reveal the perception and attitude of the Turkic peoples to the location through denotation, while the latter are based on legends and reflect the household and everyday routine specific to the Turkic peoples through connotation. As a result of complex etymological analysis, some toponyms are shown in both the denotative and connotative aspects. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that epic toponyms serve as an essential source of cognition of the worldview and national culture. Through the use of the complex methodology of analysis, the study contributes to the development of anthropological studies in toponymy and helps to establish links between Turkic languages and cultures.(c) 2023 EJAL & the Authors.

AB  - Image registration is a fundamental process in the processing and analysis of remote sensing imagery. Given the enormous increase in the availability and variety of modern remote sensors, automated registration of satellite images has become an important pre-processing task. A wide range of registration techniques has been developed for various types of applications and data. The three main stages involved in image registration are the generation of matching points, estimation of mapping functions, and resampling. The classic robust estimator, random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm has been the method of choice to accomplish this task. However, the speed of convergence of RANSAC depends on a number of factors like percentage of inliers, complexity of the transformation model etc. and there have been a few improved versions of RANSAC in literature. The ability to deduce an accurate transformation model in the presence of outliers is crucial to achieve accurate image registration results. This paper presents a new robust estimator, ProLoSAC, which performs filtering of matching points to estimate the mapping function accurately while maintaining the speed of RANSAC algorithm for image registration. We have applied the proposed algorithm for the automatic registration of multi-sensor multi-resolution remote sensing images namely, Resoucesat-1 AWIFS, GeoEye-1, Landsat-8, Pleiades-1A and AISA hyperspectral images. The validation of results carried out using various error metrics indicates that the proposed algorithm is superior to the existing approach for satellite image registration.

M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier comprises distinct features (snow, ice, and debris cover) and their identification and classification using satellite imagery is still a challenging task. Classification of different glacier features (zones) using remote sensing data is useful for numerous environmental and societal applications. The purpose of this study is to develop the fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) deep neural networks classification approach for the extraction of different features of the alpine glaciers. The developed approach was tested and classification results were compared with the support vector machines-based classification over the part of two glaciers: Siachen glacier and Bara Shigri glacier. The overall accuracy (OA) of GF-DNN classification is relatively high (91.17% for Siachen and 89% for Bara Shigri) with a good kappa coefficient (0.88 for Siachen and 0.85 for Bara Shigri) as compared to SVM for both the selected glaciers. An improvement of more than 10% is achieved in the OA of GF-DNN classification as compared to SVM for both the glaciers. The obtained classified results and accuracy demonstrates the potential of deep neural networks-based glacier features classification approach for glaciated terrain features.

AB  - Objective. To explore the use of birth care in a Sentinel Unit. Materials and methods. We interviewed eight health providers and 12 female users of health services to explore the main reasons to use birth care in a Sentinel Unit. Results. Findings indicate that the reasons for which health providers do not attend births were fear of legal claims by users, lack of institutional support if complications arise, lack of training, not feeling confident in obstetric care, and the lack of necessary supplies. Female users mentioned the perception of a lack of trained physicians and a lack of necessary materials and medicines. Conclusions. Despite the strengthening of the infrastructure and human resources, as well as a 24/365 model attention and the increase of health personnel in the sentinel units, there are still significant barriers in certain units to achieve compliance with coverage of quality obstetric care focused on the needs of women.

AB  - The intention of this work is to show a simple and efficient way to compute the deforestation area using Landsat 8 satellite images. It considers only its best band and segmentation based on thresholding. The described approach is simple to be used in public available images of this type (http://www.dgi.inpe.br/catalogo/), can be easy implemented in any computed language or downloaded in this public repository: https://github.com/rmparanhos/analise-imagens. Maybe the most complex aspect on processing this type of imaging is due to the great numbers of pixels and band (or channel) that compose each mosaic and each real area to be studied. The presented material can be useful due the difficulty of finding benchmarks to allow comparison among results.

A total 336 questionnaires for elementary school students and 92 questionnaires for pre-service elementary teachers were collected. The data was analyzed using the SPSS statistical program.Results The results of this study are as follows. First, there was no statistically significant difference in the average values of the ecological worldview of elementary school students and pre-service elementary teachers.However, the average value of elementary school students in two sub-factors was higher than the average value of pre-service teachers. Second, as a result of analyzing the ecological worldview by background variables of elementary school students, there was no significant difference in average values according to grade level. However, the average values of some of the sub-factors showed significant differences according to gender. Third, as a result of analyzing the ecological worldview by background variables of pre-service elementary teachers, there was no significant difference in average values according to grade level. But there was a significant difference in the overall average value of ecological worldview and some of its sub-factors according to gender.Conclusions The conclusions of this study are as follows. First, an individual's ecological beliefs may be independent of age. Therefore, instructors should consider these characteristics when designing education related to ecological worldview. Second, children and adults may have different processes for constructing an ecological worldview. Thus, pre-service teachers and teachers must understand children’s ecological worldview. Third, the ecological worldview of elementary school students and pre-service teachers differ according to gender. Therefore, efforts are needed to clarify the cause from various aspects.

AB  - In Australia, a financial year (or fiscal year) is the period from 1 July to 30 June of the following calendar year. As such, many databases need to represent and validate financial years efficiently. While the use of integer years with a convention that they represent the year ending is common, it may lead to ambiguity with calendar years. On the other hand, string representations may be too inefficient and do not easily admit arithmetic operations. This package tries to make validation of financial years quicker while retaining clarity. Copyright: GPL-2

AB  - Water acts as a most required thing in human life as well as for any living thing. Also, it is preferred requirement for achieving the targets of growth and development of a country or a region. Considering the limitations on exploration of water, may be surface or groundwater, it is obvious to identify and manage the available water resources with proper planning and efficiency. Present study is aimed to trace the new water resources using geo-spatial technique. Various thematic layers have been used in this study for conducting multi-criteria analysis in GIS environment and these themes were digitized from satellite data. By integrating thematic maps multi-criteria overlay analysis, based on knowledge based assigned weightage and ranked influence factors, is conducted in GIS environment. The results, obtained using geo-spatial technique, are validated with field data. It is observed that the results obtained by geo-spatial technique are in good agreement with the field observations data collected from observation wells. Groundwater prospect zones map has been generated with prospect zones classified as good, moderate and poor in accordance with their respective groundwater potential. It is concluded that the geo-spatial technique is very efficient, time and cost effective for exploration of water resources.
