TI  - Characteristics of particle fluxes in the Prydz Bay polynya, Eastern Antarctica
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The settling of particulate carbon in seawater is a key component of the ocean carbon cycle. We deployed a set of sediment trap in the polynya of Prydz Bay from December 2010 to December 2011 to investigate the seasonal variations in particle fluxes. There was a clear seasonal variation in the particle fluxes, with maximum and minimum fluxes recorded during the summer and winter, respectively. The average total flux over the sampling period was 193.58 mg m(-2) d(-1), and the average fluxes of organic carbon (C-org), inorganic carbon (C-inorg), and biogenic silica (Si-bio) were 721.78, 28.67, and 2382.80 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Si-bio was the main contributor to the total mass flux, and strongly correlated with C-org. The high Si-bio/C-org molar ratios (>1) suggest that C-org was transported to deep sea in association with Si-bio. By comparing remote sensing data of sea ice and chlorophyll in the upper water column, we found that the dynamics of carbon fluxes were closely related to changes in sea ice. Algae in sea ice may have a key role in biological pump processes in early summer. Apart from the ice algae bloom period, variations in carbon fluxes generally corresponded with phytoplankton blooms in the upper water. The ballast effect controlled the particle settling velocity and the efficiency of the biological pump. Sea ice rafts initiated the first particle export event and enhanced the particle settling efficiency during melting period. As diatoms might become less dominant in the ice-free area, sea ice loss may cause the efficiency of the biological pump efficiency to decrease over the long term.

TI  - Controversies in relation to neck management in N0 early oral tongue cancer
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The standard local treatment for early-stage tongue cancer with no clinical lymph node metastases is partial glossectomy. The frequency of occult lymph node metastasis is 20-30%. Thus, whether prophylactic neck dissection with glossectomy or glossectomy alone should be performed has been a controversial issue since the 1980s. Both treatments have advantages and disadvantages; however, especially in cases involving prophylactic neck dissection, surgical invasion and complications including the cosmetic disadvantage caused by neck skin incision, accessory nerve paralysis or facial nerve (mandibular marginal branch) paralysis, stiffness of the shoulder or neck and a feeling of neck tightness have been considered issues that could be solved by providing less-invasive treatment to the 70-80% of patients without occult lymph node metastasis. A more accurate preoperative diagnosis and strict follow-up are required to provide minimally invasive treatment while ensuring the therapeutic effect. It is also necessary to narrow down the target based on the risk-benefit balance. The depth of invasion should be considered in cases involving oral cavity malignancies. This was also taken into account in recent revisions of eighth edition of the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors and it is an important factor for N0 neck management. This review article summarizes previous and recent reports on neck management, focusing on the risk-benefit and future perspectives of the diagnosis and treatment of early-stage oral tongue cancer. This effort is an attempt to establish treatment from the patient's point of view, with the patient's quality of life taken into account.

TI  - IDENTIFICATION OF SUITABLE LOCATION FOR EXPANSION OF FISH AGGREGATING DEVICES (FADs) FOR FISHERMEN ON PACITAN OPEN SEA, INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pacitan Regency is located on the southern coast of East Java Province, Indonesia. The coastal area of Pacitan consists of a bay and open sea. Fishermen often catch fish with destructive fishing methods. FADs is a tool to increase fisheries production which is placed in a definite location. The purposes of this study were to find out the suitable area to expand FADs, to recognize the characteristics of fishermen, and to find out the benefits and readiness of Pacitan fishermen in using FADs. Fisheries production data was collected using interview techniques for fishermen and boats owners. The method for obtaining suitable location of FADs by using Geographical Information System (GIS) and remote sensing techniques. Parameters of temperature, pH, salinity, current and turbidity using Landsat 8 Image. While for chlorophyll-a by using NOAA imagery. Depth was obtained from the bathymetric map. The results showed that about 70% of sea in front of Pacitan coast is suitable for FADs expansion. In fact, only 10% of local Pacitan fishermen use Deep Sea FADs, and 10% use Shallow Sea FADs. Most FADs users in Pacitan are migrants. Development of Shallow Sea FADs is more profitable for local fishermen, because they can carry out one day fishing, low costs and reduce destructive fishing.

TI  - Simulating Current and Future River-Flows in the Karakoram and Himalayan Regions of Pakistan Using Snowmelt-Runoff Model and RCP Scenarios
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Upper Indus Basin (UIB) supplies more than 70% flow to the downstream agricultural areas during summer due to the melting of snow and glacial ice. The estimation of the stream flow under future climatic projections is a pre-requisite to manage water resources properly. This study focused on the simulation of snowmelt-runoff using Snowmelt-Runoff Model (SRM) under the current and future Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) climate scenarios in the two main tributaries of the UIB namely the Astore and the Hunza River basins. Remote sensing data from Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) along with in-situ hydro-climatic data was used as input to the SRM. Basin-wide and zone-wise approaches were used in the SRM. For the zone-wise approach, basin areas were sliced into five elevation zones and the mean temperature for the zones with no weather stations was estimated using a lapse rate value of -0.48 degrees C to -0.76 degrees C/100 m in both studied basins. Zonal snow cover was estimated for each zone by reclassifying the MODIS snow maps according to the zonal boundaries. SRM was calibrated over 2000-2001 and validated over the 2002-2004 data period. The results implied that the SRM simulated the river flow efficiently with Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient of 0.90 (0.86) and 0.86 (0.86) for the basin-wide (zone-wise) approach in the Astore and Hunza River Basins, respectively, over the entire simulation period. Mean annual discharge was projected to increase by 11-58% and 14-90% in the Astore and Hunza River Basins, respectively, under all the RCP mid- and late-21st-century scenarios. Mean summer discharge was projected to increase between 10-60% under all the RCP scenarios of mid- and late-21st century in the Astore and Hunza basins. This study suggests that the water resources of Pakistan should be managed properly to lessen the damage to human lives, agriculture, and economy posed by expected future floods as indicated by the climatic projections.

TI  - IDENTIFYING ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS HOTSPOTS AREAS USING GIS IN ETHIOPIA: A CASE STUDY OF HOSANNA TOWN
T2  - TRANSPORT AND TELECOMMUNICATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to increasing human population and the number of vehicles, road traffic accident has significant influence on human life and economic development. In the present study, road traffic accident data of three years (2015-2017) were obtained from Hosanna Town Traffic Police Department, and Hosanna Town Transport Authority in Ethiopia. The Global Position System was used to know X, Y coordinates of the accident locations. Global Position System point data and accident data were added to road network data using the 'Joins and relates' function in ArcGIS. The results of the study showed a total of 241 Road traffic accidents (RTAs) were occurred in the town from which about 208 victims occurred on people and 33 damaged properties. Based on severity and frequencies of RTAs top nine hot spot areas were identified which requires high attention to protect people and property from damage and loss. Thus, the government and other concerned stakeholders should provide public education and awareness creation to reduce risk of fatalities and property damage due to RTAs in Hosanna town.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Subpixel Geographical Evolution Mapping
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, spatiotemporal subpixel mapping (SSM) approaches have been extensively developed to deal with the mixed-pixel problem by incorporating fine spatial resolution images with the same field of view from different acquisition times. This is an alternative to the conventional subpixel mapping (SPM) method, which is based on only monotemporal images. SSM has become one of the state-of-the-art SPM approaches, and has been widely applied in urban management and ecological monitoring. However, in the traditional SSM methods, the spatial correlation within the multitemporal images is insufficiently exploited and is ignored in the spatiotemporal model construction. In addition, the contribution of the land covers' spatial distribution in the multitemporal images is incompletely considered, and the geographic variation during the time interval is ignored, which underutilizes the spatiotemporal information. In this paper, an SSM algorithm based on a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and evolutionary algorithm theory, called spatiotemporal subpixel geographical evolution mapping (STGEM), is proposed for multitemporal remote sensing images. The proposed algorithm considers the spatiotemporal dependence not only between the current subpixel and the corresponding fine pixel, but also with the neighboring fine distribution patterns within the fine image. Moreover, the potential temporal information of the geospatial variation is fully realized by considering not only the time interval between the bitemporal images, but also the ratio of changed area between them, based on the GWR model. Two synthetic-image experiments with bitemporal Landsat 8 images and bitemporal QuickBird images were carried out to validate the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, a real-image experiment using a bitemporal pair of Gaofen-2 images and a Landsat 8 image was also undertaken. A comparison was made with several traditional SPM methods, as well as the state-of-the-art SSM approaches, and the experimental results confirmed the superiority of the proposed STGEM algorithm. The proposed STGEM achieves a fine spatial and temporal resolution thematic map, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and has great potential for fine-scale and frequent time-series observation and monitoring.

TI  - The two-echelon multi-trip vehicle routing problem with dynamic satellites for crop harvesting and transportation
T2  - APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The harvesting and transportation system involves a harvest scheduling and a transportation plan. The grain, harvested by combine-harvesters, is then transported by transporters from disperse farmlands to the depot. The spot where combine-harvesters transfer wheat to transporters is dynamic because the location of these spots correspond with combine-harvesters' work. In this paper, the harvesting and transportation problem is considered as a two-echelon multi-trip vehicle routing problem with a dynamic satellite (2E-MTVRPDS) because the combine-harvester is used multiple times in the planning horizon and the transporter is used multiple times in a work day. The mixed integer linear programming model is proposed based on the features of the problem. This work presents an optimum solution with a heuristic algorithm. The dynamic satellite is transferred as the static case in the heuristic. The computational experiments are constructed to test the performances of the proposed algorithm. Five instances with different sizes are adopted to test the stability of the algorithm. The calculation deviation of testing instances is acceptable. On one hand, the optimal effectiveness can be achieved when the number of instances is less than 200. With the increase in the number of instances, the optimal efficiency declines. On the other hand, the optimal solution appears to have a time window of 0.2 h in all instances with different sizes. This study provides a decision model for agricultural production to implement optimal harvesting operations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - High-quality three-dimensional displacement fields from new-generation SAR imagery: application to the 2017 Ezgeleh, Iran, earthquake
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the three-dimensional (3D) displacement fields associated with a variety of geological phenomena has been widely performed by exploiting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, as the result is important for providing insight into the formation mechanisms and potential risks of geological hazards. New-generation SAR sensors, namely ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1, can capture surface deformation with a high coherence in wide-swath mode, thereby providing outstanding across-track displacement accuracies; however, this improvement partially sacrifices the azimuth resolution, which affects the retrieval of 3D surface deformation fields. To explore the feasibility of generating 3D deformation maps with new SAR imagery, we collect two pairs of ALOS-2 ScanSAR and four pairs of Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) images for the 12 November 2017 Ezgeleh earthquake. Furthermore, the differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR), pixel offset tracking (POT), multiple-aperture InSAR (MAI), and burst-overlap interferometry (BOI) methods are used to measure the across- and along-track displacements. Compared with the POT and MAI methods, the integration of DInSAR and BOI measurements provides high-quality 3D deformation maps with an accuracy of 4cm, which is four times and two times better than the accuracies of the POT and MAI methods integrated with DInSAR, respectively. In addition, a significant north-south displacement of 0.76m is found in our 3D deformation results that was underestimated in the slip distribution model constrained with seismic waveforms or InSAR measurements. Our 3D deformation map of the 2017 Ezgeleh earthquake indicates a southwestward horizontal motion and an upward motion without any corresponding surface rupture that effectively match the behavior of a blind rupture along a northeast-dipping reverse fault. We conclude that combining BOI with DInSAR would provide a better 3D deformation field and should be applied to study future earthquakes.

TI  - Reflectance variation in boreal landscape during the snow melting period using airborne imaging spectroscopy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We aim a better understanding of the effect of spring-time snow melt on the remotely sensed scene reflectance by using an extensive amount of optical spectral data obtained from an airborne hyperspectral campaign in Northern Finland. We investigate the behaviour of thin snow reflectance for different land cover types, such as open areas, boreal forests and treeless fells. Our results not only confirm the generally known fact that the reflectance of a melting thin snow layer is considerably lower than that of a thick snow layer, but we also present analyses of the reflectance variation over different land covers and in boreal forests as a function of canopy coverage. According to common knowledge, the highly variating reflectance spectra of partially transparent, most likely also contaminated thin snow pack weakens the performance of snow detection algorithms, in particular in the mapping of Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) during the end of the melting period. The obtained results directly support further development of the SCAmod algorithm for FSC retrieval, and can be likewise applied to develop other algorithms for optical satellite data (e.g. spectral unmixing methods), and to perform accuracy assessments for snow detection algorithms.A useful part of this work is the investigation of the competence of Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) in snow detection in late spring, since it is widely used in snow mapping. We conclude, based on the spectral data analysis, that the NDSI-based snow mapping is more accurate in open areas than in forests. However, at the very end of the snow melting period the behavior of the NDSI becomes more unstable and unpredictable in non-forests with shallow snow, increasing the inaccuracy also in non-forested areas. For instance in peatbogs covered by melting snow layer (snow depth < 30 cm) the mean NDSI-0.6 was observed, having coefficient of variation as high as 70%, whereas for deeper snow packs the mean NDSI shows positive values.

TI  - The influence of breast cancer subtypes on axillary ultrasound accuracy: A retrospective single center analysis of 583 women
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Axillary ultrasound staging (AUS) is an important tool to guide clinical decisions in breast cancer therapy, especially regarding axillary surgery but also radiation therapy. It is unknown whether biological subtypes influence axillary staging using ultrasound (AUS).Method: This is a retrospective single center analysis. All patients with breast cancer, a preoperative axillary ultrasound and a complete surgical axillary staging were included between 1999 and 2014, except patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The results of the AUS were compared with final pathological results. Biological subtypes were identified by immunohistochemistry.Results: 583 women were included in the study. Sensitivity, Specificity, positive and negative predictive value for AUS were 39%, 96%, 91% and 83%. While sensitivity was significantly lower in Luminal A and B patients (25.0%; 39.8%) as compared to non Luminal breast cancer patients (TN 68.8%; Her2+ 71.4%; p = 0.0032), there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to specificity, PPV and NPV.Conclusion: Solely regarding sensitivity of AUS, our study could show significant differences between biological subtypes of breast cancer with lower sensitivity in Luminal patients. While PPV was excellent, standing for a low overtreatment rate using AUS for clinical decision making, sensitivity was poor overall, comparable to the results of other studies.

TI  - Nature versus Nurture: A Comparison of Russian Law Graduates Destined for State Service and for Private Practice
T2  - LAW & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the mind-set of Russian law students on the cusp of graduation. Drawing on a 2016 survey, the analysis finds that, despite having taken different paths to their degrees, the respondents share a confidence in the Russian courts that distinguishes them from Russians without legal education. Within the sample, a natural division is evident between those who plan to go into state service and those who plan to go into private practice. Aspiring state lawyers are more likely to support the policies of the Putin regime, even when they preference politics over the letter of the law. This strongly suggests that the tendency of judges and state lawyers within the criminal justice system to work as a team to ensure convictions is not solely the result of workplace incentives, as had previously been assumed, but is an element of a worldview that these lawyers share that predates their legal education. Aspiring private lawyers, by contrast, are consistently more skeptical of the state. To the extent that they are later coopted by the state, as studies of criminal defense lawyers suggest, such behavior would likely be the result of a desire to endear themselves to investigators and prosecutors in order to ensure further appointments to represent indigent clients.

TI  - A combined, totally magnetic technique with a magnetic marker for non-palpable tumour localization and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for sentinel lymph node detection in breast cancer surgery
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Surgery for non-palpable breast cancer may often be a challenging procedure. Recently, a magnetic seed (Magseed (R)) used for tumour localization has been developed. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) for sentinel lymph node (SN) detection is a novel tracer that may be injected up to four weeks preoperatively. This study is the first combining the magnetic seed and SPIO.Material and methods: Patients planned for breast conserving surgery and SN-biopsy (SNB) were recruited from two units in Sweden. Patients underwent lesion localization with Magseed (R) and SPIO injection (MagtracerM) by the breast radiologist in the preoperative period. Feasibility of successful lesion localization and excision together with a successful SNB detection was evaluated. Seed migration, number of SNs, specimen volume and calculated resection ratio (CRR) were reported.A survey of the physicians' experience was conducted.Results: Localization was performed at a median of three days before surgery (range 0-25). All 32 patients underwent microscopically radical resection with a CRR of 1.49. No seed migration was noticed. SNB was successful in all patients. A median of two SNs was retrieved. Radiologists and surgeons reported the procedure easy to learn and outperformed guidewire localization in terms of localization and excision time. They thought the technique facilitated planning localization and surgery.Conclusions: The combined magnetic technique provided accuracy in tumour localization and SN detection without excess tissue excision and with promising results for flexibility in delivery of care. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO similar to The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Role of Completion Lymph Node Dissection for Sentinel Lymph Node-Positive Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose and MethodsCompletion lymph node dissection (CLND) for sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive melanoma patients has been guideline-concordant standard of care since adoption of lymphatic mapping and SLN biopsy for the management of clinically node-negative melanoma patients more than 20years ago. However, a trend for omission of CLND has been observed over the past decade, and we now have randomized, controlled clinical trial data to help guide treatment recommendations. Publication of these data prompted an American Society of Clinical OncologySociety of Surgical Oncology 2018 clinical practice guideline update for these patients.Results and ConclusionsSystematic review of current evidence supports a selective, individualized approach to CLND for SLN-positive melanoma. For low-risk, low-volume micrometastatic disease, SLN biopsy may be both diagnostic and therapeutic, and close clinical follow-up with imaging or CLND are reasonable options for appropriately selected patients. For higher-risk patients, omission of CLND requires careful consideration of risks versus benefits, relevant histopathology, and individualized patient discussion. This should address patient comorbidities and life expectancy, the predicted likelihood of additional positive nodes, availability of imaging surveillance, likelihood of adherence to imaging and clinical follow-up, consequences of regional recurrence, and the prognostic value of complete nodal staging and its impact on adjuvant therapy recommendations or clinical trial participation. Data on long-term outcomes, cost, and patient-reported quality of life measures are not yet available.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for early stage tongue cancer-a 14-year single-centre experience
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was performed to report the usage of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in clinical stage I or II tongue cancer patients with cNO necks seen over a 14-year period. Data were collected prospectively, and a retrospective analysis was performed of 41 patients with early stage oral squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and a cN0 neck. Sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive patients underwent elective neck dissection, whereas SLN-negative patients were kept under careful observation. Seven of the 41 (17%) patients enrolled in the study were found to have occult metastases. The patients were followed up for a mean duration of 92 months (range 60-144 months). The neck recurrence rate for SLN-positive patients was 0% and for SLN-negative patients was 3%. The authors recommend the routine use of SLNB in patients with early stage oral squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and a cN0 neck. Furthermore, special focus should be placed on isolated tumour cells, as their presence is of high clinical relevance.

TI  - Segmentation for Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA): A review of algorithms and challenges from remote sensing perspective
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Image segmentation is a critical and important step in (GEographic) Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA or OBIA). The final feature extraction and classification in OBIA is highly dependent on the quality of image segmentation. Segmentation has been used in remote sensing image processing since the advent of the Landsat-1 satellite. However, after the launch of the high-resolution IKONOS satellite in 1999, the paradigm of image analysis moved from pixel-based to object-based. As a result, the purpose of segmentation has been changed from helping pixel labeling to object identification. Although several articles have reviewed segmentation algorithms, it is unclear if some segmentation algorithms are generally more suited for (GE)OBIA than others. This article has conducted an extensive state-of-the-art survey on OBIA techniques, discussed different segmentation techniques and their applicability to OBIA. Conceptual details of those techniques are explained along with the strengths and weaknesses. The available tools and software packages for segmentation are also summarized. The key challenge in image segmentation is to select optimal parameters and algorithms that can general image objects matching with the meaningful geographic objects. Recent research indicates an apparent movement towards the improvement of segmentation algorithms, aiming at more accurate, automated, and computationally efficient techniques.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics of albedo across European boreal forests: Analysis of MODIS albedo and structural metrics from airborne LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainties in estimation of albedo-related radiative forcing cause ambiguity in evaluation of net climate effects of forests and forest management. Numerous studies have reported local relations between forest structure and albedo in the boreal zone. However, more research is needed to establish these relations for geographically extensive areas, and to examine seasonal courses of albedo to understand the effects of forest structure on mean annual shortwave energy balance. Remote sensing is a viable option for accomplishing these goals, but there are many challenges related to e.g. long periods of cloud cover and low solar elevations in high latitudes. We used the new MODIS Collection 6 (MCD43A3) daily albedo product, and analyzed MODIS albedo dependence on airborne LiDAR-based forest structure in 22 study sites in Estonia, Finland, Sweden, and Russia (57 degrees-69 degrees N, 12 degrees-57 degrees E). Wall-to-wall LiDAR data allowed us to take into account the effective spatial resolution of MODIS, which notably improved correlations between albedo and forest structure. Use of the best quality backup algorithm (magnitude inversion) together with main algorithm results in the MODIS albedo product did not reduce the correlations compared to using main algorithm only. We quantified the effects of landscape-level forest structure (forest height, canopy cover, fraction of young forest) and fraction of broadleaved deciduous forest on mean annual albedo. We showed that because the forest structure-albedo relations are the strongest in snow-covered periods, and because the snow-covered period is longest in the north, the effect of forest structure on mean annual albedo increases towards the north. On the other hand, the effect of broadleaved fraction did not show such latitudinal trend. Our results indicate that even within a single climatic zone the optimal forest management solution to mitigate climate change depends on geographic location.

TI  - An Operational Precipitable Water Vapor Retrieval Algorithm for Fengyun-2F/VLSSR Using a Modified Three-Band Physical Split-Window Method
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visible and Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR) onboard the Fengyun-2 (FY-2) satellite can provide valuable thermal infrared observations to help create a precipitable water vapor (PWV) product with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The current FY-2/VISSR PWV product in operation is produced by using a traditional two-band physical split-window (PSW) method, which produces low quality results under dry atmospheric conditions. Based on the sensitivity characteristics of FY-2F/VISSR water vapor channel and two split-window channels to atmospheric water vapor, this study developed a new, robust operational PWV retrieval algorithm for FY-2F to improve the operational precision of the current PWV product. The algorithm uses a modified three-band PSW method, which adds a scale for the water vapor channel in the improved three-band PSW method. Integrated PWV products from the radiosonde data in 2016 are used here to validate the precision of the PWV retrieved by the modified three-band and traditional two-band PSW methods. The mean bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient of the PWV retrieved by the modified three-band PSW method are 0.28 mm, 4.53 mm, and 0.969, respectively. The accuracy is much better than the PWV retrieved by the two-band method, whose mean bias, RMSE, and correlation coefficient are 12.67 mm, 29.35 mm, and 0.23. Especially, in mid- or high-latitude regions, the RMSE of the PWV is improved from 10 to 2 mm by changing the inversion in the two-band method to the modified three-band PSW method. Furthermore, the modified three-band PSW results show a better consistency with the radiosonde PWV at any zonal belt and season than the two-band PSW results. This new algorithm could significantly improve the quality of the current FY-2F/VISSR PWV product, especially at sites where the actual PWV are lower than 15 mm.

TI  - Spatial Resolution Enhancement of Satellite Microwave Radiometer Data with Deep Residual Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite microwave radiometer data is affected by many degradation factors during the imaging process, such as the sampling interval, antenna pattern and scan mode, etc., leading to spatial resolution reduction. In this paper, a deep residual convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to solve these degradation problems by learning the end-to-end mapping between low-and high-resolution images. Unlike traditional methods that handle each degradation factor separately, our network jointly learns both the sampling interval limitation and the comprehensive degeneration factors, including the antenna pattern, receiver sensitivity and scan mode, during the training process. Moreover, due to the powerful mapping capability of the deep residual CNN, our method achieves better resolution enhancement results both quantitatively and qualitatively than the methods in literature. The microwave radiation imager (MWRI) data from the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) satellite has been used to demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the method.

TI  - A branch and price algorithm for EOS constellation imaging and downloading integrated scheduling problem
T2  - COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation satellite (EOS) constellation imaging and downloading integrated scheduling (EOSCIDIS) is a challenging optimization problem with several engineering applications. Given a large number of imaging requests and a constellation consisting of a group of EOSs, a workable schedule must be developed for each EOS to allow for imaging and downloading in the most efficient manner given a certain scheduling horizon. No studies have proposed exact algorithms for the EOSCIDIS problem, although it has considerable potential for applications. In this paper, we developed a branch and price (B&P) algorithm for the EOSCIDIS problem. First, we decomposed the problem by extracting the sub-structure of the problem, and the decomposition resulted in a master problem and multiple pricing problems. Solving the linear relaxed master problem with column generation (CG) method provides a very tight upper bounds for the primal problem. We then embedded the CG process into a branch and bound (B&B) framework to find optimal integer solutions. In order to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, we developed a heuristic utilizing the generated columns to construct feasible integer solutions to prune B&P tree branches earlier. We tested the B&P algorithm on highly-simulated instances that are constructed according to the Chinese Gaofen-1 satellite and 3 types of random instances which correspond to short, medium and long term scheduling respectively. Both results show that our method could find high-quality solutions with optimality gap less than 10% for most instances using reasonable computational costs . (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Incorporating satellite-derived data with annual and monthly land use regression models for estimating spatial distribution of air pollution
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of annual and monthly land use regression (LUR) models for estimating the spatial distribution of NO2 and PM2.5 in Taiwan. Samples were collected at 73 air quality monitoring sites in 2015. Data transformation coupled with extracting principle components and satellite-derived data were integrated with LUR modeling and applied to increase PM2.5 model performance. Results indicated that NO2 exhibited more robust model performance compared with PM2.5. Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) R-2 of NO2 annual model was 0.76 and ranged from 0.56 to 0.81 for monthly models. The LOOCV R-2 of PM2.5 annual model was improved from 0.13 to 0.56 by applying principle component analysis and adding satellite data (i.e., percentage of sunshine coverage and aerosol optical depth). These approaches also improved the performance of PM2.5 monthly models. The median LOOCV R-2 increased from 0.12 to 0.49.

TI  - Land use/cover change in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China: Reconciling the land use conflicts between development and protection
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Development and protection are both vital human demands in ecologically vulnerable areas. An estimation of the land use/cover changes and their ecological responses could help to understand the regional ecosystem dynamics under various human demands and provide the scientific basis for managing and regulating ecosystems. In this paper, we analysed the spatial-temporal variations in land use/cover types and systematically quantified the relationships between these changes and environmental variables in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. Our results revealed that forestland coverage increased linearly to 53.48%, and that of construction land increased exponentially from 0.25% to 2.75% during 1990-2015. The land use/cover changes exhibited two distinct transformation phases: before and after impoundment. The mutual transformations among vegetation types were significant before 2000, while the forest, water and construction land coverages increased continuously by occupying cropland after 2000. The land use/cover changes were significantly correlated with environmental variables and were sensitive to three topographic variables namely, elevation, surface-height fluctuation and slope. The vegetation dynamics were easily affected by the complex and rugged topography. Moreover, the responses of land use/cover changes varied among topographic variables. The two parameters estimated in the multiple linear regression, elevation and slope, were - 0.164 and - 0.268 for forestland change, -0.391 and 0.378 for water area change, and -0.068 and -0.061 for construction land change. Forest cover was so larger in the regions of higher elevation and steeper slope that afforestation occurred in the regions of moderate elevation and slope. Urbanization and impoundment mainly occurred in the regions of lower elevation, and the regions of steeper slope were more easily submerged, while urbanization mainly occurred in the regions of gentler slope. Therefore, the land use/cover changes due to ecological protection and economic development responded to the interactions among environmental variables and was targeted to different regions to reconcile the land use conflicts, providing a reference for ecosystem management in ecologically vulnerable areas.

TI  - Automatic extraction of urban impervious surfaces based on deep learning and multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The conventional methods of urban impervious surfaces extraction mainly use the shallow-layer machine learning algorithms based on the medium- or low-resolution remote sensing images, and always provide low accuracy and poor automation level because the potential of multi-source remote sensing data are not fully utilized and the low-level features are not effectively organized. In order to address this problem, a novel method (AEIDLMRS) is proposed to automatically extract impervious surfaces based on deep learning and multi-source remote sensing data. First, the multi-source remote sensing data consisting of LIDAR points cloud data, Landsat8 images and Pleiades-1A images are preprocessed, re-sampled and registered, and then the combined features of spectral, elevation and intensity from the multi-source data are denoised using the minimum noise fraction (MNF) method to generate some representative MNF features. A small number of reliable labelled samples are automatically extracted using the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering method based on the MNF features. Secondly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract the representative features of the neighborhood windows of each pixel in the fused Pleiades-1A image through multi-layer convolution and pooling operations. Finally, the combined features of MNF features and CNN features are pre-learned via the deep belief network (DBN). The DBN parameters are globally optimized jointly using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier on the top level and the small set of labelled samples extracted via FCM, and the urban impervious surfaces are distinguished from others based on the trained ELM classifier and morphological operations. Experiments are performed to compare the proposed method with other three related methods in three different experimental regions respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that AEIDLMRS has better accuracy and automation level than the others under relatively good efficiency, and it is more suitable for the extraction of complex urban impervious surfaces.

TI  - Three Decades of Sea-Ice Variability in Jiaozhou Bay Revealed by Landsat Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used Landsat images and meteorological data to examine the spatiotemporal distribution and variability of sea ice in Jiaozhou Bay (JZB) between 1986 and 2016. The results show that JZB is not always covered by sea ice in winter, but in some extreme cases, sea ice has covered more than one-third of the sea area of the bay. Sea ice in JZB has generally formed between January 1 and February 5, primarily along the coast, and gradually expanding to the central area of the bay. Both meteorological and artificial factors have played important roles in modulating the sea ice distribution. We found sea ice coverage to have been strongly correlated with the accumulated freezing-degree days nine days before the occurrence of sea ice (R-2 = 0.767). North-northwest surface winds have dominated the freezing period of sea water in the JZB, and wind speed has exerted a more significant influence on the formation of sea ice when the sea ice coverage has been generally small. Additionally, artificial factors began to affect the expansion of sea ice in JZB since 2007. The construction of the Jiao-Zhou-Bay Bridge (JZBB) is believed to have retarded water flow and reduced the tidal prism, thereby leading to the formation of an ice bridge along the JZBB, which effectively prevents the southward expansion of sea ice.

TI  - Foundations ofChristian thought and practice: a model for replacingOld andNew Testament surveys with an innovative approach to teaching religion in 21st century colleges and universities
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Institutions of faith can no longer assume students of faith, and institutions of faith can no longer assume that a survey of the Old and New Testaments in today's college curriculum will provide the necessary elements to develop, sustain, and nurture biblical literacy in students. Nor can it be assumed that this antiquated model will equip today's students with a framework or worldview that values the relevance of religious and biblical studies. This new course (Foundations model) we propose would not attempt to compete with the content coverage of the Old and New Testament survey courses, but rather we would introduce a new concept of teaching religion, which would be thematically-based and require students to learn to articulate a Christian worldview in an intelligent and thoughtful manner. This Christian worldview would be developed throughout the course and based on assumptions, themes, and ways of thinking (issues of hermeneutics) introduced throughout the course. A descriptive recounting of the Foundations model will provide an example of what it means, or rather looks like, to effect religious education and spiritual development in the lives of students at a Christian liberal arts college or university. The Foundations model incorporates six key elements which are as follows: 1. Thematic Organization (not book-by-book survey content) 2. Specialized Workbook Focused on Themes for the Course 3. Weekly Critiques 4. The Final Worldview Paper 5. Integration of the Latest Technology 6. The Role of the Instructor and Peer Mentors.

TI  - Suitable Site Selection for Rainwater Harvesting and Storage Case Study Using Dohuk Governorate
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Middle East is an inherently dry zone. It has experienced severe drought for the last seven years, and climate change has made the situation worse. The Dohuk governorate has been suffering from an appalling water crisis. One possible way of relieving this water crisis is by properly harvesting the rainwater. Rainwater harvesting is a widely used method of storing rainwater in the countries presenting with drought characteristics. Several pieces of research have derived and developed different criteria and techniques to select suitable sites for harvesting rainwater. The main aim of this research was to identify and select suitable sites for the potential erection of dams, as well as to derive a model builder in ArcMap 10.4.1. The model combined several parameters, such as slope, runoff potential, land cover/use, stream order, soil quality, and hydrology to determine the suitability of the site for harvesting rainwater. To compute the land use/cover categories, the study depended on Landsat image data from 2018. Supervised classification was applied using the ENVI 5 software, while the slope mapping and drainage order were extracted using a digital elevation model. Inverse distance weighting (IDW) was used for the spatial interpolation of the rain data. The results demonstrated that suitable areas for water harvesting, are located in the middle and northern part of the research area, and in intensively cultivated zones. The main soil texture in these suitable sites was loam, while the rainfall rate amounted to 750 to 900 mm. This research shows that 15% and 13% of the area studied can be categorized as having excellent and good suitability for water harvesting, respectively. Furthermore, 21% and 27% of the area studied were of moderate and poor suitability, while the remaining 24% were not suitable at all.

TI  - Mining Deformation Life Cycle in the Light of InSAR and Deformation Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 constellation provides an effective new radar instrument with a short revisit time of six days for the monitoring of intensive mining surface deformations. Our goal is to investigate in detail and to bring new comprehension of the mine life cycle. The dynamics of mining, especially in the case of horizontally evolving longwall technology, exhibit rapid surface changes. We use the classical approach of differential radar interferometry (DInSAR) with short temporal baselines (six days), which results in deformation maps with a low decorrelation between the satellite images. For the same time intervals, we compare the radar results with prediction models based on the Knothe-Budryk theory for mining subsidence. The validation of the results with ground levelling measurements reveals a high level of resemblance of the DInSAR subsidence maps (-0.04 m bias with respect to the levelling). On the other hand, aside from the explicable exaggeration, the location of the subsidence trough needs improvement in the forecasted deformations (0.2 km shift in location, a deformation velocity four times higher than in DInSAR). In addition, a time lag between DInSAR (compatible with extraction) and prediction is revealed. The model improvement can be achieved by including the DInSAR results in the elaboration of the model parameters.

TI  - A comparison of area-based forest attributes derived from airborne laser scanner, small-format and medium-format digital aerial photography
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest inventory operations have greatly benefitted from remotely sensed data particularly airborne laser scanning (ALS) which has become a popular technology choice for large-area forest inventories. For remote regions, for fragmented estates or for single stand-level inventories ALS may be unsuitable because of the high cost of data acquisition. Point cloud data generated from digital aerial photography (DAP) is emerging as a cost-effective alternative to ALS. In this study we compared area-based forest inventory attributes derived from point cloud datasets sourced from AIS, small-format and medium-format digital aerial photography (SFP and MFP). Non-parametric modelling approach, namely RandomForest, was employed to model forest structural attributes at both plot- and stand-levels. The results were evaluated using field data collected at 105 inventory plots. At plot-level, the maximum difference among relative RMSEs of basal area (B-top), top height stocking (N) and total stem volume (TSV) of the three datasets was 2.46%, 0.55%, 13.29% and 2.53%, respectively. At stand-level, the maximum difference among relative RMSEs of BA, H-top, N and TSV of the three datasets was 3.86%, 1.25%, 7.85% and 6.04%, respectively. This study demonstrates the robustness of DAP across different sensors, and thus informs forest managers planning data acquisition solutions to best suit their operational needs.

TI  - HIV coinfection among persons diagnosed with hepatitis B in England in 2008-2014
T2  - HIV MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The aim of the study was to estimate HIV prevalence among persons with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in England and to examine associated risk factors. Methods Persons aged >= 15 years with an HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) test reported to Public Health England (PHE) sentinel surveillance during 2008-2014 were linked to the PHE national HIV/AIDS database. Coinfection was defined as an HIV diagnosis prior to, or within 6 months following, a positive HBsAg test. Results During 2008-2014, 2 149 933 persons were tested for HBsAg and 3.9% (1129 of 28 789) of HBsAg-positive persons were HIV positive. The probable route of HIV infection was heterosexual exposure for 95.3% of female patients and 32.3% of male patients, with 61.5% of male patients reporting sex between men. Among African-born coinfected persons, 84% probably acquired HIV there. Predictors of HIV positivity included older age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.1] and being of black ethnicity (aOR 15.5 for males; aOR 16.4 for females) or being male and of white ethnicity (aOR 8.2) compared with being female and of white ethnicity. HIV coinfection was more likely when HBV was diagnosed in sexual health (aOR 55.0), specialist liver (aOR 6.7), emergency department (aOR 5.3) and renal services (aOR 2.8) compared with general practice. Most (60.4%; 682 of 1129) coinfected persons were diagnosed with HIV infection > 6 months before HBV diagnosis. Conclusions Persons testing positive for HBsAg had a low HIV infection rate and fell largely into two groups: those of black ethnicity with probable Africa-acquired infections and white men who have sex with men (MSM) with probable UK-acquired infections. Findings reinforce existing recommendations to sustain and improve both HBV testing of migrants from HBV-prevalent countries and vaccination among HIV-positive MSM. Findings also support blood-borne virus testing in sexual health services and emergency departments.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoke as the one of weather hazard that contains large pollutant and affect the major live aspects: health, tourism, transportation and climate. Due to its regular appearance in Maritime Continent Indonesian area South East Asia, it is important to assess the satellite remote sensing Himawari_8 data to detect smoke and model the horizontal visibility as the smoke proxy. Using RGB (red, green, blue) combination, maximum likelihood and backward selection of multiple regression were used to detect and to develop the horizontal visibility model. RGB aerosol and RGB day natural color visually sees only the thick smoke with horizontal visibility observe below 1600m. The best horizontal visibility model [with significant level 95% (probability<0.05)] was develop from combination of band 3 (0.64 mu m); band 7 (3.9 mu m); and band 14 (11.2 mu m) with root means square error value is about 404m and correlation value is about 0.69.

T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Time-series datasets of Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built Index (NDBI) and other climatic factors are of significance due to their application in tracking climate change in cities. In this paper, new data processing methods are presented using the application of Google Earth Engine (GEE) and GIS. Different variables including LST (both daytime and nighttime), NDVI, NDBI, rainfall, wind speed, evapotranspiration, and surface soil moisture were computed for 18 years from 2000 to 2018 with of use of GEE platform. The study areas cover 20 top global cities which were mentioned in the global cities index report in 2018 [1]. The data sources used on GEE are: MODIS Terra LST and Emissivity 8-Day Global 1km; MODIS Terra Vegetation Indices 16-Day Global 1km; MODIS Terra Surface Reflectance 8-Day Global 500 m; TRMM Monthly Precipitation Estimate data; Terra Monthly Climate; MODIS Terra Net Evapotranspiration 8-Day Global 500 m; and NASA-USDA SMAP Global Soil Moisture Data. Also, to gather information regarding the global cities, United Nations (UN) population dataset, cities elevation and the A.T.Kerney report [1] was used. A short description of GEE functions to retrieve variables is provided. The dataset can be used to investigate the spatial-temporal relationships between LST, vegetation and built-up areas, as well as to provide the global perspective of climate and population change in various cities around the world.

TI  - Application of A Simple Landsat-MODIS Fusion Model to Estimate Evapotranspiration over A Heterogeneous Sparse Vegetation Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple Landsat-MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) fusion model was used to generate 30-m resolution evapotranspiration (ET) maps for the 2010 growing season over a heterogeneous sparse vegetation, agricultural region using the METRIC (mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration) algorithm. The fusion model performance was evaluated, and experiments were undertaken to investigate the frequency for updating Landsat-MODIS data into the fusion model during the growing season, to maintain model accuracy and reduce computation. Initial evaluation of the fusion model resulted in high bias stemming from the landscape heterogeneity and small landholdings. To reduce the bias, the fusion model was modified to be applicable pixel-wise (i.e., implementing specific pixels for generating outputs), and an NDVI-based (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) coefficient was added to capture crop phenology. A good agreement that resulted from the comparison of the fused and non-fused maps with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.15 mm day(-1) with coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.83 indicated successful implementation of the modifications. Additionally, the fusion model performance was evaluated against in-situ observation at the pixel level as well as the watershed level to estimate seasonal ET for the growing season. The default METRIC model (Landsat only) yielded relative error (RE) of 31% and RMSE of 2.44 mm day(-1), while using the modified fusion model improved the accuracy resulting in RE of 3.5% with RMSE of 0.37 mm day(-1). Considering different data frequency update, the optimal fusion experiment (RMSE of 0.61 mm day(-1), and RE of 6.5%) required the consideration of the crop phenology and weekly updates in the early growing stage and harvest time, and bi-weekly for the rest of the season. The resulting fusion model for ET output is planned to be a part of ET mapping and irrigation scheduling systems.

TI  - The prognostic value of sentinel lymph nodes on distant metastasis-free survival in patients with high-risk squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common cutaneous cancer worldwide. Several tumour characteristics are considered to pose an elevated risk for systemic spread of carcinoma cells ('high-risk' features). Early detection of subclinical metastases could permit early treatment and improve overall survival. To detect occult metastases and evaluate risk of future distant metastases, diagnostic extirpation of the sentinel lymph node (SLNE) is routinely performed in cutaneous melanoma and can be offered in high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (hrcSCC). However, the clinical utility of SLNE in patients with hrcSCC remains unknown.Material and methods: An ambidirectional cohort study with prospective patient recruitment was performed. Between July 2008 and April 2017, of 139 eligible patients, SLNE was performed in 114 cases (25 patients refused). Median follow-up was 23.7 months.Results: We analysed the characteristics of 114 patients with hrcSCC who underwent SLNE. Eighty-nine patients (78.1%) were men, and 25 patients (21.9%) were women (median age 72.2 years). In multivariable analyses, histopathological detection of ulceration (hazard ratio, HR 2.9 [95% confidence interval, CI 0.7-12.2]), perineural growth (HR 3.0 [95% CI 0.6-14.6]) and clinically occult SLN metastases (HR 10.7 [95% CI 1.9-60.6]) were strongly associated with future occurrence of distant metastases. A positive predictive value of 50% was noted for patients where SLN metastasis was detected to develop distant metastases. However, distant metastases also occurred in seven patients when histopathological SLN evaluation had shown no evidence of metastases.Conclusions: Our data suggest SLNE is not a reliable diagnostic approach to evaluate the risk of future systemic carcinoma spread and development of distant metastases in patients with hrcSCC.

TI  - A Satellite-based Remote Sensing Technique for Surface Water Quality Estimation
T2  - ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY & APPLIED SCIENCE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing provides a synoptic view of the earth surface that can provide spatial and temporal trends necessary for comprehensive water quality (WQ) monitoring and assessment. This study explores the applicability of Landsat 8 and regression analysis in developing models for estimating WQ parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), biological oxygen demand (BOD), turbidity, and conductivity. The input image was radiometrically-calibrated using fast line-of-sight atmospheric analysis (FLAASH) and then atmospherically corrected to obtain surface reflectance (SR) bands using FLAASH and dark object subtraction (DOS) for comparison. SR bands derived using FLAASH and DOS, water indices, band ratio, and principal component analysis (PCA) images were utilized as input data. Feature vectors were then collected from the input bands and subsequently regressed together with the WQ data. Forward regression results yielded significant high R-2 values for all WQ parameters except TSS and conductivity which had only 60.1% and 67.7% respectively. Results also showed that the regression models of pH, BOD, TSS, DO, and conductivity are highly significant to SR bands derived using DOS. Furthermore, the results of this study showed the promising potential of using RS-based WQ models in performing periodic WQ monitoring and assessment.

TI  - Comparison of Multi-Resolution Optical Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Radar Sentinel-1 Data for Automatic Lineament Extraction: A Case Study of Alichur Area, SE Pamir
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lineament mapping, which is an important part of any structural geological investigation, is made more efficient and easier by the availability of optical as well as radar remote sensing data, such as Landsat and Sentinel with medium and high spatial resolutions. However, the results from these multi-resolution data vary due to their difference in spatial resolution and sensitivity to soil occupation. The accuracy and quality of extracted lineaments depend strongly on the spatial resolution of the imagery. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the optical Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A, and radar Sentinel-1A satellite data for automatic lineament extraction. The framework of automatic approach includes defining the optimal parameters for automatic lineament extraction with a combination of edge detection and line-linking algorithms and determining suitable bands from optical data suited for lineament mapping in the study area. For the result validation, the extracted lineaments are compared against the manually obtained lineaments through the application of directional filtering and edge enhancement as well as to the lineaments digitized from the existing geological maps of the study area. In addition, a digital elevation model (DEM) has been utilized for an accuracy assessment followed by the field verification. The obtained results show that the best correlation between automatically extracted lineaments, manual interpretation, and the preexisting lineament map is achieved from the radar Sentinel-1A images. The tests indicate that the radar data used in this study, with 5872 and 5865 lineaments extracted from VH and VV polarizations respectively, is more efficient for structural lineament mapping than the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A optical imagery, from which 2338 and 4745 lineaments were extracted respectively.

T2  - ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY & APPLIED SCIENCE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - City design plays a major role in the way of life of its inhabitants. The growth of urban centers requires careful schemes to ascertain that the quality of life is not adversely influenced. The rate of motorization is increasing in Hyderabad, Pakistan due to inaccessible public transportation. An efficient public transportation system performs a critical part in sustaining and improving urban welfare by providing access to daily necessities. The basic aim of this study is to discuss the impacts of inaccessible public transportation on urban population, the environmental effect of recent urban transport designs, and the expansion in traffic congestion. Landsat images were used to highlight the existing public transportation routes and dynamic and more realistic travel distances and times were measured. Data were collected from local households and further frequency analysis was done through SPSS. The outcome of this research may assist the evolution of a sustainable and accessible transportation system for the urban population.

AB  - Developing growth curve for forest and environmental management is a crucial activity in forestry planning This paper describes a proposed techniquefor developing a growth curve based on the SPOT 6 satellite imageries. The most critical step in developing a model is on pre-processing the images, particularly during performing the radiometric correction such as reducing the thin cloud The pre-processing includes geometric correction, radiometric correction with image regression, and index calculation, while the processing technique include training area selection, growth curve development, and selection. The study found that the image regression offerea' good correction to the haze-distorted digital numbet: The corrected digitalnumberwassuccessfullyimplementedto evaluate the most accurate growth-curvefor predicting mangrove. Ofthefour growth curve models, i.e., Standard classical, Richards, Gompertz, and Weibull models, it was foundthat the Richards is the most accurate model in predicting the mean annual increment and current annual increment. The study concluded that the growth curve model developed using high-resolution satellite image provides comparable accuracy compared to the terrestrial method The model derived using remote sensing has about 9.16% standard of error better than those froth terrestrial data with 15. 4156% standard of error:

TI  - Seeing the wood for the trees: A new way to view the human intestinal microbiome and its connection with non-communicable disease
T2  - MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
M3  - Article
AB  - Our paper briefly reviews the connection of the intestinal microbiome to the rise in non-communicable conditions related to atopic disease, obesity and mental health. We consider that the microbiome is best treated as if it were a single entity and have borrowed the terms semiochemical, allomone and kairomone (5) to describe interspecies relationship between the microbiome and ourselves (Fig. 1). We use the term dysbiosis to describe the breakdown of these relationships leading to disease (Fig. 2). As a result of this analysis we tentatively suggest that components of the microbiome assess microbial antigens in our food and pass this information back to our immune system via as yet undescribed chemical messengers: kairomones. We call these hypothetical microbial agents Sentinel Cells. Our suggestion is that atopic disease arises partly as a result of consuming processed food that has insufficient antigens to activate this kairomone feedback mechanism, which atrophies as a result. We note that this is potentially similar to the Old Friends concept of Rook and his co-workers (16). We suggest that obesity is a consequence of dysbiosis-induced waning of the output of allomone-like psychotropic compounds (including the known microbial metabolites dopamine and serotonin) leading to the weakening of the gut-brain axis and a negative effect on mental health. Although dysbiosis can occur in other ways, including antibiotic use and sterile caesarian section, we believe that all these problems can be overcome to provide a future free of these non-communicable diseases.

TI  - Early Season Mapping of Sugarcane by Applying Machine Learning Algorithms to Sentinel-1A/2 Time Series Data: A Case Study in Zhanjiang City, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 90% of the sugar production in China comes from sugarcane, which is widely grown in South China. Optical image time series have proven to be efficient for sugarcane mapping. There are, however, two limitations associated with previous research: one is that the critical observations during the sugarcane growing season are limited due to frequent cloudy weather in South China; the other is that the classification method requires imagery time series covering the entire growing season, which reduces the time efficiency. The Sentinel-1A (S1A) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data featuring relatively high spatial-temporal resolution provides an ideal data source for all-weather observations. In this study, we attempted to develop a method for the early season mapping of sugarcane. First, we proposed a framework consisting of two procedures: initial sugarcane mapping using the S1A SAR imagery time series, followed by non-vegetation removal using Sentinel-2 optical imagery. Second, we tested the framework using an incremental classification strategy based on S1A imagery covering the entire 2017-2018 sugarcane season. The study area was in Suixi and Leizhou counties of Zhanjiang city, China. Results indicated that an acceptable accuracy, in terms of Kappa coefficient, can be achieved to a level above 0.902 using time series three months before sugarcane harvest. In general, sugarcane mapping utilizing the combination of VH + VV as well as VH polarization alone outperformed mapping using VV alone. Although the XGBoost classifier with VH + VV polarization achieved a maximum accuracy that was slightly lower than the random forest (RF) classifier, the XGBoost shows promising performance in that it was more robust to overfitting with noisy VV time series and the computation speed was 7.7 times faster than RF classifier. The total sugarcane areas in Suixi and Leizhou for the 2017-2018 harvest year estimated by this study were approximately 598.95 km(2) and 497.65 km(2), respectively. The relative accuracy of the total sugarcane mapping area was approximately 86.3%.

TI  - Effects of afforestation on soil and ambient air temperature in a pair of catchments on the Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate models and satellite remote sensing have been used to determine the effects of afforestation on soil temperature at regional and global scales. However, the coarse spatial resolution of both methods have made them insensitive to local topography, which is a controlling factor of the surface energy budget, especially in areas with complex topography. While typically applied only locally at representative sites, long-term field measurements can shed light on the role of topography on soil temperature after afforestation and provide direct evidence to verify and calibrate the results from modeling and satellite observation. In this study, a pair of neighboring catchments (one afforested and the other with natural regrowth of grasses) on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) was selected to assess the effects of afforestation on soil and ambient air temperature at different slope positions with an entire year of continuous measurements collected every 10 min. The results showed that the uphill slope in both catchments experienced higher soil and air temperatures than the downhill gully, where less solar radiation was received at the ground surface due to canopy interception and topographic shading. For example, the annual average soil (10-100 cm depth) and air temperature in the uphill slope in the forestland catchment was 1.09 and 1.22 degrees C higher than in the downhill gully, respectively. The effects of topography on soil and air temperature varied at different times of the year, and these effects interacted with the growth status of vegetation. In winter and spring, topography significantly affected soil and air temperature due to varied solar radiation received at different slope positions. By contrast, in summer, the effect of vegetation increased along with higher evapotranspiration and more solar radiation interception by the canopy, especially in the forestland catchment, which showed cooler soils than the other catchment during both the days and nights at all investigated slope positions. However, compared with the grassland catchment, the uphill slope of the forestland catchment had cooler air temperatures during the day, but warmer temperatures at night. We have concluded that both topography and afforestation influence the spatial variation and temporal dynamics of soil and air temperature, and they thereby the surface energy balance of the CLP. More local studies are warranted in order to continue to calibrate regional models and remote sensing data.

TI  - Assessing the shoreline trend changes in Southern tip of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in shoreline trend was examined for 21 stations between Manuvai (in the west) and Vijayapathi (in the east), along the southern tip of India. Multispectral satellite data of Landsat MSS (9th Feb, 1973), Landsat TM 5 (4th Sep 2001) and Landsat ETM+ (21st Jan 2006) were used to assess the temporal dynamics of shoreline trend present in the region. The images were pretreated by radiometric calibration in order to avoid the temporal deviation of spatial and spectral information. The exact shorelines were estimated by two steps of image processing techniques: Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is used to classify the land and sea water by and Sobal edge detection techniques are used to extract boundary line between land and water body. The rate of changes between the period 1973 and 2006 has shown that, the average shoreline rate is accelerated in the study area at 1.78m/year. However, unusual shoreline changes ranging from 3.60m/year to 15.60m/year has been observed between the period 2001 and 2006 due to the impact of Tsunami. The station-wise shoreline data endorsed that Chinna muttom to Visvanarayanapuram and Lipuram are under continuous depositional process whereas other stations are under erosional process. This result shows that littoral sediment movement, with respect to the wave climate and anthropogenic activities are the predominant factors that affect the shoreline trend and sediment drift prevailing in the coast.

TI  - Lymphedema Incidence After Axillary Lymph Node Dissection <i>Quantifying the Impact of Radiation and the Lymphatic Microsurgical Preventive Healing Approach</i>
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary surgery and radiotherapy are important aspects of breast cancer treatment associated with development of lymphedema. Studies demonstrate that Lymphatic Microsurgical Preventive Healing Approach (LYMPHA) may greatly reduce the incidence of lymphedema in high-risk groups. The objective of this study is to summarize the evidence relating lymphedema incidence to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), regional lymph node radiation (RLNR) therapy, and LYMPHA.Methods: We performed a literature search to identify studies involving breast cancer patients undergoing ALND with or without RLNR. Our primary outcome was the development of lymphedema. We analyzed the effect of LYMPHA on lymphedema incidence. We chose the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects meta-analytic model owing to the clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity of studies.Results: Our search strategy yielded 1476 articles. After screening, 19 studies were included. Data were extracted from 3035 patients, 711 of whom had lymphedema. The lymphedema rate was significantly higher when RLNR was administered with ALND compared with ALND alone (P < 0.001). The pooled cumulative incidence of lymphedema was 14.1% in patients undergoing ALND versus 2.1% in those undergoing LYMPHA and ALND (P = 0.029). The pooled cumulative incidence of lymphedema was 33.4% in those undergoing ALND and RLNR versus 10.3% in those undergoing ALND, RLNR, and LYMPHA (P = 0.004).Conclusion: Axillary lymph node dissection and RLNR are important interventions to obtain regional control for many patients but were found to constitute an increased risk of development of lymphedema. Our findings support that LYMPHA, a preventive surgical technique, may reduce the risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema in high-risk patients.

TI  - Technical note: development of an indirect calorimetry system to determine heat production in individual lactating sows
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to determine total heat production (THP) in individual sows and litters can be logistically difficult and often requires the use of multiple animals to generate data on a per room basis. Furthermore, these systems may be costly to construct, precluding their use by many researchers. Therefore, the objective was to develop a low-cost indirect calorimetry system to determine THP in individual lactating sows and litters. Six indirect calorimeters were constructed to house 1 sow and litter in a crate throughout farrowing and a 21-d lactation period. Farrowing crates were placed within a high-density polyethylene pan filled with water and then a polyvinyl chloride frame was constructed around the crate. The frame provided a structure to hold the inlet and outlet air pipes, feed and water inlets, air circulation fans, and a polyethylene plastic sheet that was secured at the bottom of the frame and submerged under water to maintain an air tight seal. Chamber accuracies for O-2 and CO2 were evaluated by ethanol combustion. One week pre-farrowing, 6 pregnant multiparous sows (parity 2.9 +/- 0.9; 218.3 +/- 38.6 kg BW) were housed individually in each farrowing crate and the calorimeters were maintained at thermoneutral conditions (20.9 +/- 2.6 degrees C and 43.7 +/- 18.6% relative humidity) throughout lactation. On lactation day 4, 8, 14, and 18, indirect calorimetry was performed on all sows and their litters, as well as 2 piglets from a sentinel litter to determine THP and the respiratory quotient (RQ). Sentinel piglet data were used to estimate THP and RQ for the sows independent of the litter. Sow + litter THP (kcal/h) increased (P = 0.01; 16.6%) on day 8 compared to day 4 and was greater (27.3%) on day 14 and day 18 compared to day 4 and day 8. Sow THP was greater (P = 0.01) on day 8 (401.19 +/- 17.15 kcal/h) and day 14 (430.79 +/- 12.42 kcal/h) compared to day 4 (346.16 +/- 16.62 kcal/h), and was greater on day 14 compared to day 8, and on day 18 (386.16 +/- 20.02 kcal/h) compared to day 14. No sow + litter RQ differences (P = 0.21; 1.02 +/- 0.04) were detected by day of lactation. However, sow RQ was reduced (P = 0.01) on day 14 (0.98 +/- 0.02) compared to day 4 (1.03 +/- 0.03), day 8 (1.02 +/- 0.02), and day 18 (1.04 +/- 0.03). In summary, this cost-effective system (total cost: $1,892 USD) can allow researchers to accurately evaluate THP in individual lactating sows and their litters.

TI  - Optimizing and comparing gap-filling techniques using simulated NDVI time series from remotely sensed global data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series usually suffer from remaining cloud presence, even after data pre-processing. To address this issue, numerous gap-filling (or reconstruction) techniques have been developed in the literature, although their comparison has mainly been local to regional, with only two global studies to date, and has led to sometimes contradictory results. This study builds on these different comparisons, by testing different parameterizations for five NDVI temporal profile reconstruction techniques, namely HANTS (Harmonic Analysis of Time Series), IDR (iterative Interpolation for Data Reconstruction), Savitzky-Golay, Asymmetric Gaussian and Double Logistic, and then comparing them as generally parameterized, and then with the best of the tested parameterizations. These comparisons show that the HANTS reconstruction technique provides lower errors in cloud prone areas, while the IDR method works best with shorter cloud covers. However, the remaining errors in cloud prone areas are still high, and there is room for new reconstruction techniques. Although these results are only applicable to the range of the tested parameterizations, these latter have been chosen within widely used configurations, and should provide interested users with a better understanding of the different methods and the best parameterization for their needs, as well as an estimate of the expected error in the reconstruction of NDVI time series.

TI  - Northern Hemisphere Extratropical Turbulent Heat Fluxes in ASRv2 and Global Reanalyses
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale objectively analyzed gridded products and satellite estimates of sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes over the extratropical Northern Hemisphere are compared to those derived from the regional Arctic System Reanalysis version 2 (ASRv2) and a selection of current-generation global reanalyses. Differences in H and LE among the reanalyses are strongly linked to the wind speed magnitudes and vegetation cover. Specifically, ASRv2 wind speeds match closely with observations over the northern oceans, leading to an improved representation of H compared to the global reanalyses. Comparison of evaporative fraction shows that the global reanalyses are characterized by a similar H and LE partitioning from April through September, and therefore exhibit weak intraseasonal variability. However, the higher horizontal resolution and weekly modification of the vegetation cover based on satellite data in ASRv2 provides an improved snow-albedo feedback related to changes in the leaf area index. Hence, ASRv2 better captures the small-scale processes associated with day-to-day vegetation feedbacks with particular improvements to the H over land. All of the reanalyses provide realistic dominant hemispheric patterns of H and LE and the locations of maximum and minimum fluxes, but they differ greatly with respect to magnitude. This is especially true for LE over oceanic regions. Therefore, uncertainties in heat fluxes remain that may be alleviated in reanalyses through improved representation of physical processes and enhanced assimilation of observations.

TI  - A multi-sensor and multi-temporal remote sensing approach to detect land cover change dynamics in heterogeneous urban landscapes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With global changes such as climate change and urbanization, land cover is prone to changing rapidly in cities around the globe. Urban management and planning is challenged with development pressure to house increasing numbers of people. Most up-to date continuous land use and land cover change data are needed to make informed decisions on where to develop new residential areas while ensuring sufficient open and green spaces for a sustainable urban development. Optical remote sensing data provide important information to detect changes in heterogeneous urban landscapes over long time periods in contrast to conventional approaches such as cadastral and construction data.However, data from individual sensors may fail to provide useful images in the required temporal density, which is particularly the case in mid-latitudes due to relatively abundant cloud coverage. Furthermore, the data of a single sensor may be unavailable for an extended period of time or to the public at no cost. In this paper, we present an integrated, standardized approach that aims at combining remote sensing data in a high resolution that are provided by different sensors, are publicly available for a long-term period of more than ten years (2005-2017) and provide a high temporal resolution if combined. This multi-sensor and multi-temporal approach detects urban land cover changes within the highly dynamic city of Leipzig, Germany as a case. Landsat, Sentinel and RapidEye data are combined in a robust and normalized procedure to offset the variation and disturbances of different sensor characteristics. To apply the approach for detecting land cover changes, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is calculated and transferred into a classified NDVI (Classified Vegetation Cover-CVC). Small scale vegetation development in heterogeneous complex areas of a European compact city are highlighted. Results of this procedure show successfully that the presented approach is applicable with divers sensors' combinations for a longer time period and thus, provides an option for urban planning to update their land use and land cover information timely and on a small scale when using publicly available no cost data.

TI  - Unsupervised extraction of epidemic syndromes from participatory influenza surveillance self-reported symptoms
T2  - PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal influenza surveillance is usually carried out by sentinel general practitioners (GPs) who compile weekly reports based on the number of influenza-like illness (ILI) clinical cases observed among visited patients. This traditional practice for surveillance generally presents several issues, such as a delay of one week or more in releasing reports, population biases in the health-seeking behaviour, and the lack of a common definition of ILI case. On the other hand, the availability of novel data streams has recently led to the emergence of non-traditional approaches for disease surveillance that can alleviate these issues. In Europe, a participatory web-based surveillance system called Influenzanet represents a powerful tool for monitoring seasonal influenza epidemics thanks to aid of self-selected volunteers from the general population who monitor and report their health status through Internet-based surveys, thus allowing a real-time estimate of the level of influenza circulating in the population. In this work, we propose an unsupervised probabilistic framework that combines time series analysis of self-reported symptoms collected by the Influenzanet platforms and performs an algorithmic detection of groups of symptoms, called syndromes. The aim of this study is to show that participatory web-based surveillance systems are capable of detecting the temporal trends of influenza-like illness even without relying on a specific case definition. The methodology was applied to data collected by Influenzanet platforms over the course of six influenza seasons, from 2011-2012 to 2016-2017, with an average of 34,000 participants per season. Results show that our framework is capable of selecting temporal trends of syndromes that closely follow the ILI incidence rates reported by the traditional surveillance systems in the various countries (Pearson correlations ranging from 0.69 for Italy to 0.88 for the Netherlands, with the sole exception of Ireland with a correlation of 0.38). The proposed framework was able to forecast quite accurately the ILI trend of the forthcoming influenza season (2016-2017) based only on the available information of the previous years (2011-2016). Furthermore, to broaden the scope of our approach, we applied it both in a forecasting fashion to predict the ILI trend of the 2016-2017 influenza season (Pearson correlations ranging from 0.60 for Ireland and UK, and 0.85 for the Netherlands) and also to detect gastrointestinal syndrome in France (Pearson correlation of 0.66). The final result is a near-real-time flexible surveillance framework not constrained by any specific case definition and capable of capturing the heterogeneity in symptoms circulation during influenza epidemics in the various European countries.Author summary This study suggests how web-based surveillance data can provide an epidemiological signal capable of detecting the temporal trends of influenza-like illness without relying on a specific case definition. The proposed framework was able to forecast quite accurately the ILI trend of the forthcoming influenza season based only on the available information of the previous years. Moreover, to broaden the scope of our approach, we applied it to the detection of gastrointestinal syndromes. We evaluated the approach against the traditional surveillance data and despite the limited amount of data, the gastrointestinal trend was successfully detected. The result is a near-real-time flexible surveillance and prediction tool that is not constrained by any disease case definition.

TI  - Long-term study of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction over the eastern part of India using satellite observations during pre-monsoon season
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study attempts to analyze possible aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction over the eastern part of India including Bhubaneswar city and the whole Odisha region primarily using a long-term satellite-based dataset from 2000 to 2016 during pre-monsoon period. Relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD), rainfall, and cloud properties is examined by taking convectively driven rain events. The two-sample student's t test is used to compute p value of datasets that are statically significant. Role of aerosols in governing cloud properties is analyzed through the variation of COD (cloud optical depth) and CER (cloud effective radius) in the AOD ranges 0.2-0.8. A relatively stronger and affirmative AOD-CER relationship is observed over Bhubaneswar city compared to Odisha region though the aerosols still play an appreciable role for the later too. The AOD-COD relationship is weak over both the regions. For Odisha, relationships between aerosol and cloud parameters are insignificant irrespective of rainfall regimes. Fostering of heavy rainfall over these regions takes place due to invigoration and microphysical effect during pre-monsoon months, depending upon meteorological conditions. Liquid water content and presence of a mixed-phase zone, both seem tobe quite important in the convectively driven precipitation over Odisha region including Bhubaneswar city.

TI  - On Capabilities of Tracking Marine Surface Currents Using Artificial Film Slicks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is known that films on the sea surface can appear due to ship pollution, river and collector drains, as well as natural biological processes. Marine film slicks can indicate various geophysical processes in the upper layer of the ocean and in the atmosphere. In particular, slick signatures in SAR-imagery of the sea surface at low and moderate wind speeds are often associated with marine currents. Apart from the current itself, other factors such as wind and the physical characteristics of films can significantly influence the dynamics of slick structures. In this paper, a prospective approach aimed at measuring surface currents is developed. The approach is based on the investigation of the geometry of artificial banded slicks formed under the action of marine currents and on the retrieval of the current characteristics from this geometry. The developed approach is applied to quasi stationary slick bands under conditions when the influence of the film spreading effects can be neglected. For the stationary part of the slick band where transition processes of the band formation, e.g., methods of application of surfactants on water, film spreading processes, possible wind transformation etc., become negligible, some empirical relations between the band geometrical characteristics and the characteristics of the surface currents are obtained. The advantage of the approach is a possibility of getting information concerning the spatial structure of marine currents along the entire slick band. The suggested approach can be efficient for remote sensing data verification.

TI  - Analysis of a severe dust storm and its impact on air quality conditions using WRF-Chem modeling, satellite imagery, and ground observations
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a comprehensive analysis of an extreme dust event recorded in the Arabian Peninsula and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) between 31 March and 3 April 2015. Simulations of the dust event with the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with the Chemistry module (WRF-Chem) were analyzed and verified using MSG-SEVIRI imagery and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the recent 1-km Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm for MODIS Terra/Aqua. Data from the National Centers for Atmospheric Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) and the upper-air radiosonde observations were used to understand the synoptic of the event. In addition, the impact of the event on atmospheric and air quality conditions is investigated. The Air Quality Index (AQI) was calculated prior, during, and after the event to assess the degradation of air quality conditions. Simulated temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and surface radiation were compared to observations at six monitoring stations in the UAE giving R-2 values of 0.84, 0.63, 0.60, and 0.84, respectively. From 1 to 2 April 2015, both observations and simulations showed an average drop in temperature from 33 to 26 degrees C and radiance reduction from about 950 to 520 Wm(-2). The AOD modeled by WRF-Chem showed a good correlation with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements in the UAE with R-2 of 0.83. The AQI over the UAE reached hazardous levels during the peak of the dust event before rapidly decreasing to moderate-good air quality levels. This work is the first attempt to demonstrate the potential of using WRF-Chem to estimate AQI over the UAE along with two satellite products (MODIS-MAIAC and MSG-SEVIRI) for dust detection and tracking.

CP  - 28th Annual Conference of the Association-for-the-Study-of-Ethnicity-and-Nationalism (ASEN)
CL  - London, ENGLAND
AB  - The rise of the populist right in the West is emerging as the most discussed manifestation of nationalism in the world today. In this paper, I argue that this 'new nationalism' is largely driven by immigration, which affects ethnic majorities within nation-states. This in turn alters the ethnic character of the nation, challenging what I term the ethno-traditions of nationhood. Our inherited concepts of ethnic and civic nationalism were developed in an earlier period when immigration was limited and territorial revisionism animated nationalist movements. Only on the furthest reaches of the extreme right is the worldview one of ethnic nationalism. In our demographically churning yet territorially static western world, we need a new term to describe the cultural nationalism of the anti-immigration right. I characterise this as ethno-traditional nationalism, a variety of nationalism which seeks to protect the traditional preponderance of ethnic majorities through slower immigration and assimilation but which does not seek to close the door entirely to migration or exclude minorities from national membership.

TI  - Metastatic melanoma vs lymphoma. Using a sentinel lymph node biopsy a diagnostic tool
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a prognostic tool used in cases of melanoma with a stage IB or greater and the absence of clinical lymphadenopathy. A positive SLNB historically indicated a need for regional lymph node clearance. However, cases of clinical lymphadenopathy in the presence of primary melanoma negates the use of SLNB and rather the British Association of Dermatologists advocate a primary block dissection of regional lymphatic tissue [NICE UK. Melanoma: assessment and management. NICE Guideline NG 14. 2015]. The following describes the case of a patient with an original stage II melanoma and a concurrent diagnosis of B cell lymphoma associated with widespread lymphadenopathy. Our multi-disciplinary team believe the use of SLNB is a more informative investigation compared with ultrasonograpphy and fine needle aspiration for such cases. In cases of clinical uncertainty due to a dual diagnosis of lymphoma, cytology would not provide nodal morphology or histological architecture, required for lymphoma grade and subtype.

TI  - Facility and Regional Factors Associated With the New Adoption of Electronic Medical Records in Japan: Nationwide Longitudinal Observational Study
T2  - JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The rate of adoption of electronic medical record (EMR) systems has increased internationally, and new EMR adoption is currently a major topic in Japan. However, no study has performed a detailed analysis of longitudinal data to evaluate the changes in the EMR adoption status over time.Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the changes in the EMR adoption status over time in hospitals and clinics in Japan and to examine the facility and regional factors associated with these changes.Methods: Secondary longitudinal data were created by matching data in fiscal year (FY) 2011 and FY 2014 using reference numbers. EMR adoption status was defined as "EMR adoption," " specified adoption schedule," or " no adoption schedule." Data were obtained for hospitals (n=4410) and clinics (n=67,329) that had no adoption schedule in FY 2011 and for hospitals (n=1068) and clinics (n=3132) with a specified adoption schedule in FY 2011. The EMR adoption statuses of medical institutions in FY 2014 were also examined. A multinomial logistic model was used to investigate the associations between EMR adoption status in FY 2014 and facility and regional factors in FY 2011. Considering the regional variations of these models, multilevel analyses with second levels were conducted. These models were constructed separately for hospitals and clinics, resulting in four multinomial logistic models. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% Bayesian credible interval (CI) were estimated for each variable.Results: A total of 6.9% of hospitals and 14.82% of clinics with no EMR adoption schedules in FY 2011 had adopted EMR by FY 2014, while 10.49% of hospitals and 33.65% of clinics with specified adoption schedules in FY 2011 had cancelled the scheduled adoption by FY 2014. For hospitals with no adoption schedules in FY 2011, EMR adoption/scheduled adoption was associated with practice size characteristics, such as number of outpatients (from quantile 4 to quantile 1: OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.005-2.84 and OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.80-3.21, respectively), and number of doctors (from quantile 4 to quantile 1: OR 4.20, 95% CI 2.39-7.31 and OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.52-2.64, respectively). For clinics with specified EMR adoption schedules in FY 2011, the factors negatively associated with EMR adoption/cancellation of scheduled EMR adoption were the presence of beds (quantile 4 to quantile 1: OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45-0.72 and OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.96, respectively) and having a private establisher (quantile 4 to quantile 1: OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.55 and OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19-0.91, respectively). No regional factors were significantly associated with the EMR adoption status of hospitals with no EMR adoption schedules; population density was positively associated with EMR adoption in clinics with no EMR adoption schedule (quantile 4 to quantile 1: OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.32-1.69).Conclusions: Different approaches are needed to promote new adoption of EMR systems in hospitals as compared to clinics. It is important to induce decision making in small-and medium-sized hospitals, and regional postdecision technical support is important to avoid cancellation of scheduled EMR adoption in clinics.

TI  - Aerosols impact on the convective and non-convective rain distribution over the Indian region: Results from WRF-Chem simulation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) is used to simulate rainfall pattern over the Indian landmass during a normal monsoon year (June-September 2010). Sensitivity analysis is performed using three different microphysical (MP) schemes (Thompson, Morrison, and Lin) to simulate the rainfall pattern and distribution over India. A significant difference in the rainfall amount, as well as distribution, is observed among the MP schemes, despite using the same model configuration and the meteorological and chemical initial and boundary condition. Lin MP scheme performed better than other schemes in simulating the rainfall over the Indian domain. Heavy rainfall along the foothills of the Himalayas, the mountainous coastal region of western India, and the northeastern part of India and sparse rainfall over northwest India are captured realistically in the model, which agrees well with the observed rainfall pattern over India. The spatial distribution of aerosol optical depths retrieved from the MODIS satellites is broadly well simulated by the model.The model simulated convective and non-convective rainfall characteristics over the Indian landmass are found to be consistent with the monsoon precipitation climatology. It is shown that the change in both convective and non-convective rainfall due to aerosols and chemistry is non-negligible over India during monsoon season. The total rainfall is found to increase significantly over the entire Western Ghats and some part of northeast India, while it is diminished over the northwest, north and east India when aerosol chemistry effects are considered in the model simulation. Additional analysis is performed to simulate the perturbations in convective and non-convective rainfall due to aerosols (e.g., dust, sea salt, black carbon etc.). Results show that the effect of aerosols on convective and non-convective rainfall distribution over India is non-linear. Depending on the meteorological conditions, topography, and the type of aerosol, the aerosol impact and feedback on monsoon rainfall can be positive, negative, or neutral.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility assessment using Frequency Ratio, a case study of northern Pakistan
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern Pakistan is attributed with rough terrain, active seismicity, monsoon rains, and therefore hosts to variety of geohazards. Among the geohazards, landslides are the most frequent hazard with devastating impacts on economy and society. However, for most of the northern Pakistan, landslide susceptibility maps are not available which can be used for landslide hazard mitigation. This study aims to develop a remote sensing based landslide inventory, analysing their spatial distribution and develop the landslide susceptibility map. The area, selected for this study is comprised of Haramosh valley, Bagrote valley and some parts of Nagar valley, in the Central Karakoram National Park (CKNP) in Gilgit-Baltistan, northern Pakistan. The SPOT-5 satellite image was used to develop a landslide inventory which was subsequently verified in the field. The landslide causative factors of topographic attributes (slope and aspect), geology, landcover, distances from fault, road and streams were used to evaluate their influence on the spatial distribution of landslides. The study revealed that the distance to road, slope gradient has the significant influence on the spatial distribution of the landslides, followed by the geology. The derived results were used in the Frequency ratio technique to develop a landslide susceptibility map. The developed landslide susceptibility map can be utilized for landslide mitigation in the study area. (C) 2018 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

AB  - BackgroundThe aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent method for sentinel lymph node detection in early gastric cancer.MethodsBetween December 2012 and December 2014, 28 cases of pilot examination were performed at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. Advanced version of multispectral fluorescence organoscope was used to identify sentinel node by quantitative estimation of ICG fluorescent signal intensity. Sensitivity, specificity, false positive value were analyzed and compared with dual tracer method.ResultsA total of 443 lymph nodes in 28 cases were examined and 184 sentinel nodes (41.5%) were identified by dual tracer method. The sensitivity using near-infrared ICG method was 98.9%. The specificity was 76.0% and false positive rate was 25.4% compared with dual tracer method. The adequate threshold for sentinel node detection was considered as 10% of maximum signal intensity.ConclusionNew near-infrared ICG fluorescent method could be a promising protocol for sentinel node navigation surgery in early gastric cancer.

AB  - PurposeTo assess postbiopsy pigmentation (PBP) as a prognostic feature in patients with cutaneous head and neck (H&N) melanoma.MethodsRetrospective review of patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for H&N melanoma (1998-2018). PBP was defined as visible remaining pigment at the scar or biopsy site that was documented on physical exam by both a medical oncologist and a surgeon at initial consultation. Variables associated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.ResultsAmong 300 patients, 34.3% (n=103) had PBP and 44.7% (n=134) had microscopic residual disease on final pathology after wide local excision. Prognostic factors associated with DFS included advanced age, tumor depth, ulceration, PBP, and positive SLNB (p<0.05). Patients with PBP fared worse than their counterparts without PBP in 5-year DFS [44.1% (31.1-56.3%) vs. 73.0% (64.1-80.0%); p<0.001] and 5-year OS [65.0% (50.0-76.6%) vs. 83.6% (75.7-89.2%); p=0.005]. After multivariable adjustment, PBP remained associated with shorter DFS [hazard ratio (HR) 1.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-2.93; p=0.047], but was not prognostic of OS.ConclusionsIn patients with H&N melanoma, PBP is associated with significantly shorter DFS. Patients with PBP may warrant greater consideration for SLNB and closer postoperative surveillance.

AB  - Purpose of reviewLow, high, extreme, and variable temperatures have been linked to multiple adverse health outcomes, particularly among the elderly and children.Recent modelsincorporating satellite remote sensing data have mitigated several limitations of previous studies, improving exposure assessment. This review focuses on these new temperature exposure models and their application in epidemiological studies. Recent findings Satellite observations of land surface temperature have been used to model air temperature across large spatial areas at high spatiotemporal resolutions. These models enable exposure assessment of entire populations and have been shown to reduce error in exposure estimates, thus mitigating downward bias in health effect estimates.SummarySatellite-based models improve our understanding of spatiotemporal variation in temperature and the associated health effects. Further research should focus on improving the resolution of these models, especially in urban areas, and increasing their use in epidemiological studies of direct temperature exposure and vector-borne diseases.

T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This contribution provides a first characterization of the environmental development for the surroundings of the UNESCO World Heritage site of Gobekli Tepe. We base our analyses on a literature review that covers the environmental components of prevailing bedrock and soils, model- and proxy-based climatic development, and vegetation. The spatio-temporal scales that are covered are mainly the Eastern Mediterranean region and the Late Quaternarywhereby special attention is given to available data from the close vicinity of Gobekli Tepe. Information on Late Quaternary geomorphodynamics is largely absent for the environs of Gobekli Tepe, we therefore included remote sensing data, different terrain modeling approaches and field-based geomorphological mapping to gain insights into past process dynamics. The findings indicate that the environmental conditions at Gobekli Tepe during its time of occupation differed significantly from today, showing denser vegetation and a wide spread sediment cover. Different hypotheses are developed that aim to guide future research on environmental changes and their variations during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. These activities are crucial for a more profound understanding of the environment of the site, its potential perception by humans and therefore for the development of narratives on their landscape creation motives.

TI  - Correlation of melanoma gene expression score with clinical outcomes on a series of melanocytic lesions
T2  - HUMAN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A 23-gene expression signature was recently developed as an adjunct to histopathology to differentiate melanocytic nevi from melanoma. The current study con elated the gene expression signature scores to actual clinical outcomes in cases from the first validation study. RNA was extracted from 127 archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections of melanocytic lesions. Gene expression was measured using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and a weighting algorithm was used to generate a numeric score. Gene expression test results were compared to histopathological diagnoses and development of local recurrence, sentinel lymph node metastases, and distant metastases. Sixty-five lesions were diagnosed histopathologically as melanoma. Fourteen developed metastases. Gene expression test results were malignant in 61 of 65 (93.8%) lesions (including all lesions that metastasized), indeterminate in 2 of 65 (3.1%) lesions, and benign in 2 of 65 (3.1%) lesions. The remaining 62 lesions were diagnosed as benign by histopathology. Gene expression test results were benign in 48 of 62 (77.4%), indeterminate in 7 of 62 (11.3%), and malignant in 7 of 62 (11.3%). There was a strong con elation between the gene expression signature test results and clinical outcomes. All lesions that metastasized were correctly identified by the test as malignant melanoma.

TI  - Forest cover dynamics and underlying driving forces affecting ecosystem services in western Kenya
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation poses a threat to sustainability of forest ecosystem services and socio-economic development in many parts of Kenya. Understanding the trend and extent of forest cover changes and the underlying driving forces over time is pertinent for sustainable management of ecosystems. However, in many parts of the country, such information is still somewhat unknown due to limited data availability for multi-temporal analysis. This paper focuses on western Kenya, a major agricultural region of biodiversity and water catchments that are under threat from forest cover dynamics. The study analyses the status of the forests in the region with the aim of determining the areal extent of coverage, trends in forest cover, drivers of change and associated impacts of deforestation. To achieve these objectives, remote sensing techniques were used to undertake supervised classification on Landsat images of 1995, 2001, 2010 and 2017 with classification scheme of forest and non-forest land cover classes. The results of the study showed that the changes in forest cover varied over time and space. There was considerable net gain in forest areas by about 43% between the period 1995-2001, and thereafter, a continuous decrease ending in a 12.5% loss by 2017. Deforestation in the region is caused by a combination of complex factors that include population pressure, politics and failures in implementation of policy. This study determined the forest cover dynamics and driving forces across diversified sub-basins, an approach that had not been used by previous studies in the region. Thus, the findings will provide valuable information for decision making pertaining to integrated land use and catchment management in order to realize the enormous benefits of sustainable forest ecosystems. The information will not only be important to the study area, but equally applicable to similar tropical regions.

Rivers subsequently overloaded with excess pyroclastic sediments have some of the highest reported specific sediment yields. Much less is known about how hillslopes respond to tephra loads. Here, we report a pulsed and distinctly delayed increase in landslide activity following the eruptions of the Chaiten (2008) and Puyehue-Cordon Caulle (2011) volcanoes in southern Chile. Remote-sensing data reveal that land-slides clustered in densely forested hillslopes mostly two to six years after being covered by tephra. This lagged instability is consistent with a gradual loss of shear strength of decaying tree roots in areas of high tephra loads. Surrounding areas with comparable topography, forest cover, rainfall and lithology maintained landslide rates roughly ten times lower. The landslides eroded the landscape by up to 4.8 mm on average within 30 km of both volcanoes, mobilizing up to 1.6 MtC at rates of about 265 tC km(-2) yr(-1). We suggest that these yields may reinforce the elevated river loads of sediment and organic carbon in the decade after the eruptions. We recommend that studies of post-eruptive mass fluxes and hazards include lagged landslide responses of tephra-covered forested hillslopes, to avoid substantial underestimates.

TI  - The impact of urban pollution on metal contamination of selected forest pockets in Cape Town, South Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forests are exposed to metals, such as manganese, copper, and zinc in the atmosphere that originate from anthropogenic activities, that include vehicle-related traffic, industries, construction sites, fossil fuel burning for heating and cooking purposes, and resuspension processes related to urban surfaces. Not only is the rich biodiversity of plant and animal species in forests under threat, but so are the biodiversity of soil, sustaining ecosystem functions, as well as human health. The objective of this study was therefore to determine the concentrations of manganese, copper, and zinc arising from urban, industrial, and traffic-related pollution in the remote and/or untouched urban indigenous forests using soil, leaf litter, and key forest organisms (mosses, lichens, and millipedes) in three forests (Platbos, Orange Kloof, and Newlands) in the Western Cape, South Africa. Elevated concentrations of these metals were found in the forests closest to the city, as well as at sites in close proximity of vehicle traffic.

AB  - We report here a case of a 78-year-old woman, who underwent mastectomy for breast cancer. Mammography showed a mass in the right MO area with an unclear boundary. Ultrasound examination revealed an irregular mass of 40*29*19mm in the right C region. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI showed a 34mm tumor with contrast effect in the C area of the right breast. We performed a core needle biopsy on the mass, and the histopathological diagnosis was apocrine carcinoma(ER-, PgR-, HER2 3+, and Ki-67 30%)of clinical T2N0M0, stageⅡA. Right mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. In the postoperative pathological examination, the main lesion was apocrine carcinoma(ER-, PgR-, HER2 3+, Ki-67 20%)and Paget's disease(ER-, PgR-, HER2 3+, Ki-67 30%). After surgery, the patient was given trastuzumab therapy.

TI  - L-Band Passive Microwave Data from SMOS for River Gauging Observations in Tropical Climates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Flood Detection Systems (GFDS) currently operated at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) is a satellite-based observation system that provides daily stream flow measurements of global rivers. The system was initially established using NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning RadiometerEarth Observing System (AMSR-E) Ka-band passive microwave satellite data. Since its initiation in 2006, the methodology and the GFDS database have been further adapted for data acquired by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) GOES Precipitation Index (GPI), the AMSR2 sensor onboard the Global Change Observation Mission - Water satellite (GCOM-W1), and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) sensor. This paper extends the same flow monitoring methodology to low frequency (L-band) passive microwave observations obtained by the European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) sensor that was launched in 2009. A primary focus is tropical climate regions with dense rainforest vegetation (the Amazon, the Orinoco, and the Congo basins) where high-frequency microwave observations from GFDS reveal a significant influence of vegetation cover and atmospheric humidity. In contrast, SMOS passive microwave signatures at the much lower L-band frequency exhibit deeper penetration through the dense vegetation and minimal atmospheric effects, enabling more robust river stage retrievals in these regions. The SMOS satellite river gauging observations are for 2010-2018 and are compared to single-sensor GFDS data over several river sites. To reduce noise, different filtering techniques were tested to select the one most suitable for analysis of the L-band time series information. In-situ water level (stage) measurements from the French Observation Service SO Hybam database were used for validation to further evaluate the performance of the SMOS data series. In addition to GFDS data, water stage information from Jason-2 and Jason-3 altimetry was compared to the microwave results. Correlation of SMOS gauging time series with in-situ stage data revealed a good agreement (r = 0.8-0.94) during the analyzed period of 2010-2018. Moderate correlation was found with both high frequency GFDS data series and altimetry data series. With lower vegetation attenuation, SMOS signatures exhibited a robust linear relationship with river stage without seasonal bias from the complex hysteresis effects that appeared in the Ka-band observations, apparently due to different attenuation impacts through dense forests at different seasonal vegetation stages.

TI  - Performance of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance products for river remote sensing retrievals of chlorophyll-<i>a</i> and turbidity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers and other freshwater systems play a crucial role in ecosystems, industry, transportation and agriculture. Despite the > 40 years of inland water observations made possible by optical remote sensing, a standardized reflectance product for inland waters is yet forthcoming. The aim of this work is to compare the standard USGS land surface reflectance product to two Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 aquatic remote sensing reflectance products over the Amazon, Columbia and Mississippi rivers. Landsat-8 reflectance products from all three routines are then evaluated for their comparative performance in retrieving chlorophyll-a and turbidity in reference to ship borne, underway in situ validation measurements. The land surface product shows the best agreement (4% Mean Absolute Percent Difference) with field measurements of radiometry collected on the Amazon River and generates 36% higher reflectance values in the visible bands compared to aquatic methods (ACOLITE and SeaDAS) with larger differences between land and aquatic products observed in Sentinel-2 (0.01 sr(-1)) compared to Landsat-8 (0.001 sr(-1)). Choice of atmospheric correction routine can bias Landsat-8 retrievals of chlorophyll-a and turbidity by as much as 59% and 35% respectively. Using a more restrictive time window for matching in situ and satellite imagery can reduce differences by 5-31% depending on correction technique. This work highlights the challenges of satellite retrievals over rivers and underscores the need for future optical and biogeochemical research aimed at improving our understanding of the absorbing and scattering properties of river water and their relationships to remote sensing reflectance.

TI  - Decline in surface urban heat island intensity in India during heatwaves
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Heatwaves cause human mortality around the world and are projected to rise in the future. Despite the influence of urban heat island (UHI) on heatwaves, the role of UHI on heatwave intensification in urban areas in India remains unrecognized. Here usingin situ, satellite observations, and model simulations, we show that urban areas in India do not intensify heatwaves. The frequency of hot-days has significantly (p-value <0.05) increased in urban areas during 1951-2016. The frequency of hot-nights has also increased in the majority of urban areas in India except those located in Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). We show that a decline in the frequency of hot-nights (-4.5 1.6 hot-nights) in IGP during 1951-2016 is mainly due to intensive irrigation in the region. We confirm the influence of irrigation on land surface temperature (LST) over IGP using simulations from Community Land Model (CLM4). Our results show that Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) intensity in major urban areas in India declines during heatwaves both during the day (-0.3 0.7 degrees C) and night (-0.3 0.4 degrees C) from the reference SUHIs. Surrounding non-urban areas (44.5 5.5 degrees C) are warmer than urban areas (43.7 6.8 degrees C) during heatwaves due to the absence of vegetation. Our results have implications for policy related to health impacts during heatwaves.

TI  - Alternative Vegetation States in Tropical Forests and Savannas: The Search for Consistent Signals in Diverse Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, the spatial distribution of vegetation is governed primarily by climatological factors (rainfall and temperature, seasonality, and inter-annual variability). The local distribution of vegetation, however, depends on local edaphic conditions (soils and topography) and disturbances (fire, herbivory, and anthropogenic activities). Abrupt spatial or temporal changes in vegetation distribution can occur if there are positive (i.e., amplifying) feedbacks favoring certain vegetation states under otherwise similar climatic and edaphic conditions. Previous studies in the tropical savannas of Africa and other continents using the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation continuous fields (VCF) satellite data product have focused on discontinuities in the distribution of tree cover at different rainfall levels, with bimodal distributions (e.g., concentrations of high and low tree cover) interpreted as alternative vegetation states. Such observed bimodalities over large spatial extents may not be evidence for alternate states, as they may include regions that have different edaphic conditions and disturbance histories. In this study, we conduct a systematic multi-scale analysis of diverse MODIS data streams to quantify the presence and spatial consistency of alternative vegetation states in Sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis is based on the premise that major discontinuities in vegetation structure should also manifest as consistent spatial patterns in a range of remote sensing data streams, including, for example, albedo and land surface temperature (LST). Our results confirm previous observations of bimodal and multimodal distributions of estimated tree cover in the MODIS VCF. However, strong disagreements in the location of multimodality between VCF and other data streams were observed at 1 km scale. Results suggest that the observed distribution of VCF over vast spatial extents are multimodal, not because of local-scale feedbacks and emergent bifurcations (the definition of alternative states), but likely because of other factors including regional scale differences in woody dynamics associated with edaphic, disturbance, and/or anthropogenic processes. These results suggest the need for more in-depth consideration of bifurcation mechanisms and thus the likely spatial and temporal scales at which alternative states driven by different positive feedback processes should manifest.

TI  - Seasonal modulation of mesoscale processes alters nutrient availability and plankton communities in the Red Sea
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrographic and atmospheric forcing set fundamental constraints on the biogeochemistry of aquatic ecosystems and manifest in the patterns of nutrient availability and recycling, species composition of communities, trophic dynamics, and ecosystem metabolism. In the Red Sea, latitudinal gradients in environmental conditions and primary production have been ascribed to fluctuations in Gulf of Aden Water inflow, upwelling/mixing, and regenerated nutrient utilization i.e. rapidly recycled nitrogen in upper layers. However, our understanding of upper layer dynamics and related changes in plankton communities, metabolism and carbon and nitrogen export is limited. We surmised that stratification and mesoscale eddies modulate the nutrient availability and taxonomic identity of plankton communities in the Red Sea. Based on remote-sensing data of sea level anomalies and high resolution in situ measurements (ScanFish) we selected stations for hydrographic CTD profiles, water sampling (nutrients, seawater oxygen stable isotopes [delta O-18(sw)]), phytoplankton and zooplankton collections. In fall 2014, strong stratification subjected the plankton community to an overall nitrogen and phosphorus shortage. The nutrient deficiency increased numbers of heterotrophic dinoflagellates, microzooplankton, and diazotrophs (Trichodesmium, diatom-diazotroph associations [DDAs]), albeit largely decreased phytoplankton and mesozooplankton abundances. In spring 2015, mesoscale eddies increased the nutrient availability, and the thermohaline characteristics and low delta O-18(sw) point to the interaction of eddies with Gulf of Aden Surface Water (GASW). Cyclonic eddies and, most likely, the availability of nutrients associated with the GASW, increased the abundances of autotrophs (diatoms, Prasinophytes) and supported larger numbers of zooplankton and their larvae. We demonstrate that the interplay of stratification, advection of Gulf of Aden water and mesoscale eddies are key elements to better understand changes in plankton community composition, ecosystem metabolism, and macronutrient export in the Red Sea in space and time.

TI  - Association of Influenza-like Illness Activity With Hospitalizations for Heart Failure The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study
T2  - JAMA CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Influenza is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but to our knowledge, few studies have explored the temporal association between influenza activity and hospitalizations, especially those caused by heart failure (HF).OBJECTIVE To explore the temporal association between influenza activity and hospitalizations due to HF and myocardial infarction (MI). We hypothesized that increased influenza activity would be associated with an increase in hospitalizations for HF and MI among adults in the community.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS As part of the community surveillance component of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a population-based study with hospitalizations sampled from 4 US communities, data were collected from 451 588 adults aged 35 to 84 years residing in the ARIC communities from annual cross-sectional stratified random samples of hospitalizations during October 2010 to September 2014.EXPOSURES Monthly influenza activity, defined as the percentage of patient visits to sentinel clinicians for influenza-like illness by state, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Surveillance Network.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The monthly frequency of MI hospitalizations (n = 3541) and HF hospitalizations (n = 4321), collected through community surveillance and adjudicated as part of the ARIC Study.RESULTS Between October 2010 and September 2014, 2042 (47.3%) and 1599 (45.1%) of the sampled patients who were hospitalized for HF and MI, respectively, were women and 2391 (53.3%) and 2013 (57.4%) were white, respectively. A 5% monthly absolute increase in influenza activity was associated with a 24% increase in HF hospitalization rates, standardized to the total population in each community, within the same month after adjusting for region, season, race/ethnicity, sex, age, and number of MI/HF hospitalizations from the month before (incidence rate ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.11-1.38; P < .001), while overall influenza activity was not significantly associated with MI hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.90-1.17; P = .72). Influenza activity in the months before hospitalization was not associated with either outcome. Our model suggests that in a month with high influenza activity, approximately 19% of HF hospitalizations (95% CI, 10%-28%) could be attributable to influenza.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Influenza activity was temporally associated with an increase in HF hospitalizations across 4 influenza seasons. These data suggest that influenza may contribute to the risk of HF hospitalization in the general population.

TI  - Impact of Disturbances on the Carbon Cycle of Forest Ecosystems in Ukrainian Polissya
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change continues to threaten forests and their ecosystem services while substantially altering natural disturbance regimes. Land cover changes and consequent management entail discrepancies in carbon sequestration provided by forest ecosystems and its accounting. Currently there is a lack of sufficient and harmonized data for Ukraine that can be used for the robust and spatially explicit assessment of forest provisioning and regulation of ecosystem services. In the frame of this research, we established an experimental polygon (area 45 km(2)) in Northern Ukraine aiming at estimating main forest carbon stocks and fluxes and determining the impact caused by natural disturbances and harvest for the study period of 2010-2015. Coupled field inventory and remote sensing data (RapidEye image for 2010 and SPOT 6 image for 2015) were used. Land cover classification and estimation of biomass and carbon pools were carried out using Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) method, respectively. Remote sensing data indicates a ca. 16% increase of carbon stock, while ground-based computations have shown only a ca. 1% increase. Net carbon fluxes for the study period are relatively even: 5.4 Gg Cyear(-1) and 5.6 Gg C Cyear(-1) for field and remote sensing data, respectively. Stand-replacing wildfires, as well as insect outbreaks and wind damage followed by salvage logging, and timber harvest have caused 21% of carbon emissions among all C sources within the experimental polygon during the study period. Hence, remote sensing data and non-parametric methods coupled with field data can serve as reliable tools for the precise estimation of forest carbon cycles on a regional spatial scale. However, featured land cover changes lead to unexpected biases in consistent assessment of forest biophysical parameters, while current management practices neglect natural forest dynamics and amplify negative impact of disturbances on ecosystem services.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing, Machine Learning, and Citizen Science in Dutch Archaeological Prospection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the history of automated archaeological object detection in remotely sensed data is short, progress and emerging trends are evident. Among them, the shift from rule-based approaches towards machine learning methods is, at the moment, the cause for high expectations, even though basic problems, such as the lack of suitable archaeological training data are only beginning to be addressed. In a case study in the central Netherlands, we are currently developing novel methods for multi-class archaeological object detection in LiDAR data based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This research is embedded in a long-term investigation of the prehistoric landscape of our study region. We here present an innovative integrated workflow that combines machine learning approaches to automated object detection in remotely sensed data with a two-tier citizen science project that allows us to generate and validate detections of hitherto unknown archaeological objects, thereby contributing to the creation of reliable, labeled archaeological training datasets. We motivate our methodological choices in the light of current trends in archaeological prospection, remote sensing, machine learning, and citizen science, and present the first results of the implementation of the workflow in our research area.

TI  - Findings and lessons from establishing Zika virus surveillance in southern Viet Nam, 2016
T2  - WESTERN PACIFIC SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To document the evolution and optimization of the Zika virus (ZIKV) disease surveillance system in southern Viet Nam in 2016 and to describe the characteristics of the identified ZIKV-positive cases.Methods: We established a sentinel surveillance system to monitor ZIKV transmission in eight sites in eight provinces and expanded the system to 71 sites in 20 provinces in southern Viet Nam in 2016. Blood and urine samples from patients who met the case definition at the sentinel sites were tested for ZIKV using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City (PI-HCMC). We conducted descriptive analysis and mapped the ZIKV-positive cases.Results: In 2016, 2190 specimens from 20 provinces in southern Viet Nam were tested for ZIKV at PI-HCMC; 626 (28.6%), 484 (22.1%), 35 (1.6%) and 1045 (47.7%) tests were conducted in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of the year, respectively. Of these tested specimens, 214 (9.8%) were ZIKV positive with 212 (99.1%) identified in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, the highest positivity rate was those in age groups 30-39 years (30.0%) and 40-59 years (31.6%). Of the 214 ZIKV-positive patients, 210 (98.1%) presented with rash, 194 (90.7%) with fever, 149 (69.6%) with muscle pain, 123 (57.5%) with joint pain and 66 (30.8%) with conjunctivitis.Discussion: The surveillance system for ZIKV disease underwent several phases of optimization in 2016, guided by the most up-to-date local data. Here we demonstrate an adaptable surveillance system that detected ZIKV-positive cases in southern Viet Nam.

AB  - Objective: This research aimed to determine biological pathways and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for 305-d milk yield (MY), 305-d fat yield (FY), and age at first calving (AFC) in the Thai multibreed dairy population.Methods: Genotypic information contained 75,776 imputed and actual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 2,661 animals. Single-step genomic best linear unbiased predictions were utilized to estimate SNP genetic variances for MY, FY, and AFC. Fixed effects included herd-year-season, breed regression and heterosis regression effects. Random effects were animal additive genetic and residual. Individual SNP explaining at least 0.001% of the genetic variance for each trait were used to identify nearby genes in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed. The PPI of genes were identified and visualized of the PPI network.Results: Identified genes were involved in 16 enriched pathways related to MY, FY, and AFC. Most genes had two or more connections with other genes in the PPI network. Genes associated with MY, FY, and AFC based on the biological pathways and PPI were primarily involved in cellular processes. The percent of the genetic variance explained by genes in enriched pathways (303) was 2.63% for MY, 2.59% for FY, and 2.49% for AFC. Genes in the PPI network (265) explained 2.28% of the genetic variance for MY, 2.26% for FY, and 2.12% for AFC.Conclusion: These sets of SNP associated with genes in the set enriched pathways and the PPI network could be used as genomic selection targets in the Thai multibreed dairy population. This study should be continued both in this and other populations subject to a variety of environmental conditions because predicted SNP values will likely differ across populations subject to different environmental conditions and changes over time.

T2  - Revista alergia Mexico (Tecamachalco, Puebla, Mexico : 1993)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Although there are high quality clinical guidelines about allergic rhinitis, many patients receive deficient treatment, partly due to the high level of self-medication. MASK (Mobile Airways Sentinel Network) is an integral part of a project against chronic diseases which it is focused on active and healthy aging and is supported by the European Union. It forms the third phase of ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma) in which, through a mobile app on a smart device, the purpose is to guide patients in the control of their multimorbidity, allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, or asthma. The "Allergy Diary" app by MACVIA-ARIA is free and it is available for Android and iOS; on it, patients indicate how unpleasant the symptoms are on a daily basis through five screens with an analogous visual scale; two more screens were recently added (sleep affectation). With the app, it is also possible to download the information of the "Allergy Diary" on the physician's computer through a QR code at the moment of the medical consultation. In this article, we review the first year of experience in Spain, Mexico and Argentina, where the Spanish version is used.

TI  - High Morbidity and Mortality Among Patients With Sentinel Admission for Injection Drug Use-Related Infective Endocarditis
T2  - OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Hospitalizations for individuals with injection drug use-related infective endocarditis (IDU-IE) represent an increasing portion of all patients with endocarditis. This study describes the evolving trends in demographics, clinical characteristics, rates of surgical intervention, and mortality among patients hospitalized with IE, comparing those with and without injection drug use.Methods. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted between January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2015 at a tertiary care center in Boston, Massachusetts. Endocarditis was defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code and verified by the modified Duke Criteria for IE. The clinical characteristics, microbiology, site of infection, complications of IE, and outcome were all abstracted by chart review. Rates of surgical consultation and surgical intervention within 90 days of admission were obtained, and assessment of surgical risk calculated was by EuroSCORE II (euroscore.org/calc). Subsequent hospitalizations for all causes were also reviewed.Results. Injection drug use-related infective endocarditis occurred in younger patients with lower rates of diabetes, renal dysfunction, and prior cardiothoracic (CT) surgery than those without IDU. Injection drug use-related infective endocarditis was associated with higher rates of complications, CT surgery consultation, and surgery within 90 days for absolute surgical indication. Readmissions for endocarditis occurred in 20% of IDU-IE patients and 9% of those with non-IDU IE. All-cause 1-year mortality rates were similar (IDU-IE 16%, non-IDU IE 13%; P = .58).Conclusions. Despite younger age, fewer medical comorbidities, and fewer prior cardiac surgeries, all-cause 1-year mortality was similar for patients after sentinel admission for IDU-IE compared with non-IDU IE. Interventions in the acute hospital setting and after discharge are needed to support patients with IDU-IE, focusing on harm reduction and treatment of addiction to reduce the unexpectedly high mortality of this young population.

TI  - Satellite Derived Bathymetry Survey Method - Example of Hramina Bay
T2  - TRANSACTIONS ON MARITIME SCIENCE-TOMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) method uses satellite or other remote multispectral imagery for depth determination in very shallow coastal areas with clear waters. Commonly, SDB survey method can be used when planning hydrographic surveying of marine areas not surveyed or areas with old bathymetric data. This method has become widely used in the past few years. SDB is a survey method founded on analytical modelling of light penetration through the water column in visible and infrared bands. In this article, SOB method was applied by using freeof-charge Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellite images to get the bathymetric data in the area of Hramina Bay in the Central Adriatic. SDB processing procedures and algorithms were described. Processed satellite data was uploaded on geodetic software and ENC S-57 format. The bathymetric map of Hramina Bay obtained by the SDB method was compared with the approach usage band Electronic Nautical Chart (ENC) HR400512 with satisfying positional and vertical accuracy.

TI  - Mixed-severity wildfire and habitat of an old-forest obligate
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency, extent, and severity of wildfire strongly influence the structure and function of ecosystems. Mixed-severity fire regimes are the most complex and least understood fire regimes, and variability of fire severity can occur at fine spatial and temporal scales, depending on previous disturbance history, topography, fuel continuity, vegetation type, and weather. During high fire weather in 2013, a complex of mixed-severity wildfires burned across multiple ownerships within the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion of southwestern Oregon where northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) demographics were studied since 1990. A year prior to these wildfires, high-resolution, remotely sensed forest structural information derived from light detection and ranging (lidar) data was acquired for an area that fully covered the extent of these fires. To quantify wildfire impact on northern spotted owl nesting/roosting habitat, we fit a relative habitat suitability model based on pre-fire locations used for nesting and roosting, and forest structure variables developed from 2012 lidar data. Our pre-fire habitat suitability model predicted nesting/roosting locations well, and variable response functions followed known resource selection patterns. These forests had typical characteristics of old-growth forest, with high density of large live trees, high canopy cover, and complex structure in canopy height. We projected the pre-fire model onto lidar data collected two months post-fire to produce a post-fire suitability map, which indicated that >93% of pre-fire habitat that burned at high severity was no longer suitable forest for nesting and roosting. We also quantified the probability that pre-fire nesting/roosting habitat would burn at each severity class (unburned/low, low, moderate, high). Pre-fire nesting/roosting habitat had lower probability of burning at moderate or high severity compared to other forest types under high burning conditions. Our results indicate that northern spotted owl habitat can buffer the negative effects of climate change by enhancing biodiversity and resistance to high-severity fires, which are predicted to increase in frequency and extent with climate change. Within this region, protecting large blocks of old forests could be an integral component of management plans that successfully maintain variability of forests in this mixed-ownership and mixed-severity fire regime landscape and enhance conservation of many species.

TI  - Developing a case definition for type 1 diabetes mellitus in a primary care electronic medical record database: an exploratory study.
T2  - CMAJ open
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying cases of disease in primary care electronic medical records (EMRs) is important for surveillance, research, quality improvement and clinical care. We aimed to develop and validate a case definition for type 1 diabetes mellitus using EMRs.METHODS: For this exploratory study, we used EMR data from the Southern Alberta Primary Care Network within the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN), for the period 2008 to 2016. For patients identified as having diabetes mellitus according to the existing CPCSSN case definition, we asked family physicians to confirm the diabetes subtype, to create the reference standard. We used 3 decision-tree classification algorithms and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression to identify variables that correctly distinguished between type 1 and type 2 diabetes cases.RESULTS: We identified a total of 1309 people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, 110 of whom were confirmed by their physicians as having type 1 diabetes. Two machine learning algorithms were useful in identifying these cases in the EMRs. The first algorithm used "type 1" text words or age less than 22 years at time of initial diabetes diagnosis; this algorithm had sensitivity 42.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 33.5%-52.5%), specificity 99.3% (95% CI 98.6%-99.7%), positive predictive value 85.5% (95% CI 72.8%-93.1%) and negative predictive value 94.9% (95% CI 93.5%-96.1%). The second algorithm used a combination of free-text terms, insulin prescriptions and age; it had sensitivity 87.3% (95% CI 79.2%-92.6%), specificity 85.4% (95% CI 83.2%-87.3%), positive predictive value 35.6% (95% CI 29.9%-41.6%) and negative predictive value 98.6% (95% CI 97.7%-99.2%).INTERPRETATION: We used machine learning to develop and validate 2 case definitions that achieve different goals in distinguishing between type 1 and type 2 diabetes in CPCSSN data. Further validation and testing with a larger and more diverse sample are recommended.

TI  - Evaluation of JAXA Himawari-8-AHI Level-3 Aerosol Products over Eastern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel geostationary satellite, the H8/AHI (Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager), greatly improved the scan times per day covering East Asia, and the operational products have been stably provided for a period of time. Currently, atmospheric aerosol pollution is a major concern in China. H8/AHI aerosol products with a high temporal resolution are helpful for real-time monitoring of subtle aerosol variation. However, the H8/AHI aerosol optical thickness (AOT) product has been updated three times since its launch, and the evaluation of this dataset is currently rare. In order to validate its accuracy, this study compared the H8/AHI Level-3 (L3) hourly AOT products of all versions with measurements obtained from eleven sunphotometer sites located in eastern China from 2015 to 2018. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 AOT products from the same period were also used for inter-comparison. Although the H8/AHI AOT retrievals in version 010 show a moderate agreement with ground-based observations (correlation coefficient (R): 0.66-0.85), and the time series analysis shows that it can effectively monitor hourly variation, it suffers from an obvious underestimation of 0.3 compared to ground-based and MODIS observations. After the retrieval algorithm updated the predefined aerosol model, the overall underestimation of AHI AOTs was solved (version 010 slope: 0.43-0.62, version 030 slope: 0.75-1.02), and the AOTs in version 030 show a high agreement with observations from ten sites (R: 0.73-0.91). In addition, the surface reflectance dataset derived from the minimum reflectivity model in version 010 is inaccurate in parts of eastern China, for both bright and dark land surfaces, which leads to the overestimation of the AOT values under low aerosol loads at the Beijing and Xianghe sites. After the update of the surface dataset in version 030, this phenomenon was alleviated, resulting in no significant difference in scatterplots under different surface conditions. The AOTs of H8/AHI version 030 show a significant improvement compared to the previous two versions, but the spatial distribution of AHI is still different from MODIS AOT products due to the differences in sensors and algorithms. Therefore, although the evaluation in this study demonstrates the effectiveness of H8/AHI AOT products for aerosol monitoring at fine temporal resolutions, the performance of H8/AHI AOT products needs further study by considering more conditions.

TI  - Retrieval of Oil-Water Mixture Ratio at Ocean Surface Using Compact Polarimetry Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The oil-water mixture ratio for oil spills on the ocean surface is an important parameter for volume estimation of oil spills, response strategy for the oil spills, cleanup operations, and remediation planning for the impacts on wildlife. Hybrid-polarized (HP) mode compact polarization (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery will soon be available with the launch of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission. The advantage of the proposed new SAR system is that CP images will have wider swath and shorter revisit time compared to quad-polarization (QP) images, which are presently available from space-borne and air-borne SAR. We present a methodology to retrieve the oil-water mixture ratio at the ocean surface using CP SAR imagery. We emulated the HP mode of CP SAR image using Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) L band observations collected on 23 June 2010 over the site of the Deep Water Horizon drilling rig. The gap between elements ratio of CP SAR covariance matrix and that of QP SAR Sinclair matrix is bridged. Numerical optimization and look up table methods are used to relate the oil-water mixture ratio to elements of the covariance matrix for the HP data backscatter. The mixture ratio estimates determined from the ratio of diagonal elements of the covariance matrix for HP mode CP data are compared with results retrieved from the co-polarization ratio from the original QP SAR observations. Results from the proposed methodology for SAR images captured in the HP mode of CP data are shown to compare favourably to observed in situ data of the mixture ratios.

TI  - Responses of grassland to climate change and human activities in the area around Qinghai Lake
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - The actual (NPPA) and potential (NPPP) net primary productivity in the area around Qinghai Lake were calculated based on MODIS NPP data, meteorological data and Thornthwaite model. The difference between NPPP and NPPA was used to quantify the impacts of human activities on net primary productivity (NPPH). The temporal and spatial changes of grassland NPPA, as well as the effects of climate change and human activities on grassland were analyzed. From 2000 to 2015, the average NPPA was 176.93 g C . m(-2) . a(-1). In addition, NPPA exhibited a generally increasing trend between 2000 and 2015. In terms of spatial distribution, NPPA increased gradually from west to east. 87.42% of the grasslands were restored, whereas only 12.58% were degraded between 2000 and 2015. For the effects of climate change and human activities on grassland restoration, the climate change, human activities and their combined effect of climate change and human activities contributed to 10.98%, 5.27% and 83.75%, respectively. For the effects of climate change and human activities on grassland degradation, the climate change, human activities and the combined effect of climate change and human activities contributed to 6.28%, 50.75%, and 42.97%, respectively. It is concluded that the grassland degradation in this area was mainly caused by irrational human activities, such as overgrazing, grassland reclamation and land cover change.

TI  - FY-3D and FY-3C onboard observations for differential code biases estimation
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of Low Earth Orbit satellites, differential code biases (DCBs) estimation based on onboard observations has been widely studied. In this study, onboard observations of BDS and GPS satellites by the Chinese Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) and Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) satellites are applied to estimate BDS and GPS DCBs. Since only the code observations of C1C and C2W for GPS, and C2I and C7I for BDS are tracked by FY-3D and FY-3C, the DCB types of GPS C1C-C2W and BDS C2I-C7I are estimated with code multipath considered. First, the DCB estimates based on FY-3D onboard observations are analyzed. When jointly processing BDS+GPS onboard observations, the stability of satellite and receiver DCBs for both BDS and GPS has better consistency with the DCB products of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Chinese Academy of Science than that for the single-system solutions (BDS-only solution and GPS-only solution). This is reasonable because more onboard observations are used in BDS+GPS solution, which can improve the strength of the DCB estimation. The variations of receiver DCB are analyzed as a function of geomagnetism and solar activity, but little relationship between them has been found. Compared with the FY-3C solution, the FY-3D solution can achieve a more stable satellite DCB with a stability improvement of 33%, 48%, 62% and 56% for GPS, BDS GEO, IGSO, and MEO satellites, respectively. Meanwhile, the receiver DCB of FY-3D is more stable than that of FY-3C as well. These improvements of satellite and receiver DCBs can be due to the enhancement of FY-3D GNSS Occultation Sounder (GNOS) instrument, which provides more observations with higher quality. Furthermore, both FY-3D and FY-3C onboard observations are processed together to estimate BDS and GPS DCBs. Compared with the FY-3D solution, the stability of satellite DCB can be improved by 16%, 9% and 7% for GPS, BDS GEO and IGSO satellites DCB, respectively, when both FY-3D and FY-3C onboard observations are jointly processed. The impact of DCB estimation on estimating the vertical total electron content (VTEC) is also investigated. Compared with FY-3D GPS-only and BDS+GPS solutions, the VTEC estimates along the FY-3D orbit can achieve more realistic results for FY-3D+FY-3C solution.

TI  - Deep learning based cloud detection for medium and high resolution remote sensing images of different sensors
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is an important preprocessing step for the precise application of optical satellite imagery. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based cloud detection method named multi-scale convolutional feature fusion (MSCFF) for remote sensing images of different sensors. In the network architecture of MSCFF, the symmetric encoder-decoder module, which provides both local and global context by densifying feature maps with trainable convolutional filter banks, is utilized to extract multi-scale and high-level spatial features. The feature maps of multiple scales are then up-sampled and concatenated, and a novel multi-scale feature fusion module is designed to fuse the features of different scales for the output. The two output feature maps of the network are cloud and cloud shadow maps, which are in turn fed to binary classifiers outside the model to obtain the final cloud and cloud shadow mask. The MSCFF method was validated on hundreds of globally distributed optical satellite images, with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5 to 50 m, including Landsat-5/7/8, Gaofen-1/2/4, Sentinel-2, Ziyuan-3, CBERS-04, Huanjing-1, and collected high-resolution images exported from Google Earth. The experimental results show that MSCFF achieves a higher accuracy than the traditional rule-based cloud detection methods and the state-of-the-art deep learning models, especially in bright surface covered areas. The effectiveness of MSCFF means that it has great promise for the practical application of cloud detection for multiple types of medium and high-resolution remote sensing images. Our established global high-resolution cloud detection validation dataset has been made available online (http://sendimage.whu.edu.cn/en/mscff/).

AB  - The China seismo-electromagnetic satellite (ZH-1) has been successfully launched on February 2nd, 2018. In-orbit test on the satellite data is undergoing, and meanwhile, the quality of the scientific data needs to be verified. The VLF electric field power spectrum data at night side of ZH-1 from May to June 2018 has been analyzed. The re-orbit data above the VLF transmitters at different L shell with different radiation frequencies have been analyzed. It can be found that the standard deviation of the electric field excited by the VLF transmitters observed by the ZH-1 satellite is similar with DEMETER satellite. The observed electric fields are generally consistent with the full-wave simulation results, which mean that ZH-1 satellite's electric field PSD data at VLF band is stable and reliable. In addition, the electric field distribution and the propagation mode of the signal from the VLF transmitters have also been studied above the transmitters and their conjugate regions. The results show that the electromagnetic waves penetrating the lower ionosphere propagate in the way of the 'duct' or the 'non-duct' whistler mode to the topside of VLF transmitter and its conjugate region. Because of the Landau damping, the electromagnetic energy reaching the conjugate region is usually smaller than it just above the transmitter. It is easier for the VLF transmitters located at L<1. 5 to propagate as the 'non duct' whistler mode. The electric field distribution has northward displacement at the conjugate region for the 'duct' mode.

TI  - Ship Detection for PolSAR Images via Task-Driven Discriminative Dictionary Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection with polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has received increasing attention for its wide usage in maritime applications. However, extracting discriminative features to implement ship detection is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel ship detection method for PolSAR images via task-driven discriminative dictionary learning (TDDDL). An assumption that ship and clutter information are sparsely coded under two separate dictionaries is made. Contextual information is considered by imposing superpixel-level joint sparsity constraints. In order to amplify the discrimination of the ship and clutter, we impose incoherence constraints between the two sub-dictionaries in the objective of feature coding. The discriminative dictionary is trained jointly with a linear classifier in task-driven dictionary learning (TDDL) framework. Based on the learnt dictionary and classifier, we extract discriminative features by sparse coding, and obtain robust detection results through binary classification. Different from previous methods, our ship detection cue is obtained through active learning strategies rather than artificially designed rules, and thus, is more adaptive, effective and robust. Experiments performed on synthetic images and two RADARSAT-2 images demonstrate that our method outperforms other comparative methods. In addition, the proposed method yields better shape-preserving ability and lower computation cost.

TI  - Soft x-ray spectroscopic endstation at beamline 08U1A of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility
T2  - REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A spectroscopic endstation with magnetic field, voltage, and low temperature control has been installed and commissioned at the soft X-ray beamline 08U1A of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, which can obtain a magnetic field up to +/- 0.53 T, applied current and bias voltage, and cryogenic temperatures down to 14 K with a Gifford-McMahon cycle cryocooler. The endstation can perform soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy methods including total electron yield, fluorescence yield, and X-ray excited optical luminance. Combined with an elliptically polarized undulator and the in situ conditions, the endstation can effectively perform X-ray magnetic circular and linear dichroism experiments in the soft X-ray range between photon energies of 250 and 2000 eV.

TI  - Revisiting effectiveness of turbidity index for the switching scheme of NIR-SWIR combined ocean color atmospheric correction algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately removing atmospheric interferences and retrieving water-leaving reflectance are decisive for subsequent ocean color applications. Over turbid waters, the black pixel assumption at the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region does not hold, and shortwave infrared (SWIR)-based atmospheric correction algorithm should be applied. Turbidity index is proposed to detect turbid waters and worked as a criterion for NIR-SWIR combined algorithm. However, studies demonstrated that turbidity index did not work well as expected. This study, using simulated data and satellite images, aimed to revisit the effectiveness of turbidity index for the switching scheme of NIR-SWIR algorithm. The simulated data were obtained from aerosol look-up tables, and the Aqua MODIS images were used. The variations of turbidity index calculated from aerosol reflectance and Rayleigh-corrected reflectance were explored. Results showed that turbidity index did not obey the assumption that it should be close to one over clear waters with negligible NIR water-leaving reflectance; its value calculated from simulated aerosol reflectance ranged from 0.7 to 2.2; and the turbidity index values varied depending on fine-mode fraction, aerosol optical thickness, relative humidity and observing geometries. Therefore, more effective switching scheme should be developed for the NIR-SWIR combined atmospheric correction algorithm.

TI  - Evaluation of SMAP, SMOS-IC, FY3B, JAXA, and LPRM Soil Moisture Products over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Its Surrounding Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality and long time-series soil moisture (SM) data are increasingly required for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) to more accurately and effectively assess climate change. In this study, to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of SM data, five passive microwave remotely sensed SM products are collected over the QTP, including those from the soil moisture active passive (SMAP), soil moisture and ocean salinity INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC), Fengyun-3B microwave radiation image (FY3B), and two SM products derived from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR2). The two AMSR2 products are generated by the land parameter retrieval model (LPRM) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) algorithm, respectively. The SM products are evaluated through a two-stage data comparison method. The first stage is direct validation at the grid scale. Five SM products are compared with corresponding in situ measurements at five in situ networks, including Heihe, Naqu, Pali, Maqu, and Ngari. Another stage is indirect validation at the regional scale, where the uncertainties of the data are quantified by using a three-cornered hat (TCH) method. The results at the regional scale indicate that soil moisture is underestimated by JAXA and overestimated by LPRM, some noise is contained in temporal variations in SMOS-IC, and FY3B has relatively low absolute accuracy. The uncertainty of SMAP is the lowest among the five products over the entire QTP. In the SM map composed by five SM products with the lowest pixel-level uncertainty, 66.64% of the area is covered by SMAP (JAXA: 19.39%, FY3B: 10.83%, LPRM: 2.11%, and SMOS-IC: 1.03%). This study reveals some of the reasons for the different performances of these five SM products, mainly from the perspective of the parameterization schemes of their corresponding retrieval algorithms. Specifically, the parameterization configurations and corresponding input datasets, including the land-surface temperature, the vegetation optical depth, and the soil dielectric mixing model are analyzed and discussed. This study provides quantitative evidence to better understand the uncertainties of SM products and explain errors that originate from the retrieval algorithms.

TI  - Identifying rice stress on a regional scale from multi-temporal satellite images using a Bayesian method
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crops are prone to various types of stress, such as caused by heavy metals, drought and pest/disease, during their life cycle. Heavy metal stress in crops poses a serious threat to crop quality and human health. However, differentiating between heavy metal and non-heavy metal stress presents a great challenge, since responses to environmental stress in crops are complex and uncertain, with different stressors possibly triggering similar canopy reflectance responses. This study aims to infer the occurrence probability of heavy metal stress (i.e., Cd stress) on a regional scale by integrating satellite-derived vegetation index and spatio-temporal characteristics of different stressors with a Bayesian method. The study area is located in the Hunan Province, China. Seven scenes of Sentinel-2 satellite images from 2016 to 2017 were collected, as well as Cd concentrations in the soil. First, the probability of rice being stressed was screened using the normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE) at all the growth stages of rice. Further, the stressed rice was used as input, along with the coefficients of spatio-temporal variation (CSTV) derived from NDRE, for a Bayesian method to infer rice exposed to Cd pollution. The results demonstrated that NDRE was a sensitive indicator for assessing stress levels in rice crops. The CSTV with a threshold of 2.7 successfully detected rice under Cd as well as abrupt stress on a regional scale. A high map accuracy for Cd induced stress in rice was achieved with an accuracy of 81.57%. This study suggests that vegetation index obtained from satellite images can assist in capturing crop stress, and that the used Bayesian method can be very useful for distinguishing a specific stressor in crops by incorporating temporal-spatial characteristic of different stressors in crops into satellite-derived vegetation index.

TI  - Spatial-temporal evolution of urban heat Island in Xi'an from 2006 to 2016
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - During the rapid development of urbanization, the urban heat island (UHI), becomes one of the major urbanization progress problems that affects the environmental, social and ecology profoundly. Analyzing the UHI can help understanding the UHI status and the physical characteristics of cities, and is significant to provide ecosystem management plans and mitigation strategies for the UHI. By utilizing the MODIS LST products, Landsat series data and the ecological regionalization data, and applying the corresponding methods to derive the NDVI, the fractional vegetation cover (F-v) and the LST normalizations results, the study conducted the spatial-temporal evolution of the UHI in Xi'an from 2006 to 2016. The main work includes analyzing the spatial evolution characters, analyzing the temporal evolution characters and exploring the relationship between LST and vegetation cover. Spatial evolution results showed that the UHI to the north of the urban land control line in 2016 became intensified and enhanced in the form of increasing the LST and the UHI zone. As for the temporal evolution, the Low Temperature Zone and Sub-low Temperature Zone had little changes and corresponded with the urban land control line, and the Medium Temperature Zone decreased on large area while the Sub-high Temperature Zone increased on large area, when compared results of 2006 with that of 2016. The relationship between LST and vegetation cover indicated that increasing vegetation cover had a certain active role for reducing LST and mitigating the UHI. The positive intervention and guidance of the government on the ecological protection can reduce the UHI, effectively.

TI  - Decrease in urban energy intensity: Is there a role for urban spatial structure?
T2  - ENERGY SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using satellite remote sensing data and the threshold panel model, this research explores the impact of urban spatial structure on urban energy intensity. The evaluation index of urban spatial structure includes compactness and elongation rate. Results from empirical studies of 30 cities in China from 1996 to 2016 indicate that urban spatial structure has a significant impact on urban energy intensity. There is a positive correlation between urban spatial structure elongation rate and urban energy intensity. However, with the increase in urban fixed assets investment, there is a negative correlation between elongation rate and energy intensity, which implies an inverted-U relationship. The results also indicate that urban compactness is negatively correlated with urban energy intensity. Therefore, proper management of urban spatial structure can effectively promote the reduction in urban energy intensity. The elongation of urban suburb space and the compactness with the internal space of the city can be developed simultaneously. While playing the role of a spatial agglomeration economy, the negative effects of over agglomeration are avoided, which jointly promote the reduction in urban energy intensity.

TI  - The decade-long Machaze-Zinave aftershock sequence in the slowly straining Mozambique Rift
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern Mozambique is the southernmost expression of the continental East African Rift. Here, extension rates are low and rifting is achieved through normal faulting. Incipient rift environments provide an ideal location to investigate the role of reactivated pre-existing structures, aftershock sequences and fault interactions in rift development. In 2016 an M-w 5.6 earthquake occurred in the Zinave region of southern Mozambique, similar to 10 km south-east of the M-w 7.0 2006 Machaze earthquake. We reanalyse ENVISAT InSAR observations of the Machaze earthquake, together with new Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations of the Zinave earthquake, and solve for uniform and distributed slip models for both events. We find that the Machaze earthquake occurred on a steeply dipping (similar to 75 degrees) fault, in agreement with other studies, but that the Zinave earthquake occurred on an similar to 60 degrees dipping fault. The occurrence of the Zinave earthquake at the same depth as afterslip following the Machaze earthquake suggests laterally heterogeneous crustal frictional properties. The Machaze earthquake caused a Coulomb stress increase of similar to 0.2 MPa on the Zinave fault. The full > 10 yr record of seismicity following the Machaze event can be fit by the Omori law, showing that the Zinave earthquake is part of a decade-long aftershock sequence, consistent with long-duration aftershock sequences in other slowly straining regions. Aftershocks represent a major hazard that needs to be considered if a large earthquake were to occur in the southern East African Rift system today.

TI  - Comparative Study on Coastal Depth Inversion Based on Multi-source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal depth is an important research focus of coastal waters and is also a key factor in coastal environment. Dongluo Island in South China Sea was taken as a typical study area. The band ratio model was established by using measured points and three multispectral images of Landsat-8, SPOT-6 (Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre, No.6) and WorldView-2. The band ratio model with the highest accuracy is selected for the depth inversion respectively. The results show that the accuracy of SPOT-6 image is the highest in the inversion of coastal depth. Meanwhile, analyzing the error of inversion from different depth ranges, the accuracy of the inversion is lower in the range of 0-5 m because of the influence of human activities. The inversion accuracy of 5-10 m is the highest, and the inversion error increases with the increase of water depth in the range of 5-20 m for the three kinds of satellite images. There is no linear relationship between the accuracy of remote sensing water depth inversion and spatial resolution of remote sensing data, and it is affected by performance and parameters of sensor. It is necessary to strengthen the research of remote sensor in order to further improve the accuracy of inversion.

CP  - 130th Annual Meeting of the Southern-Surgical-Association

AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the shortage of available liver grafts, transplantation (LTx) of hepatitis C virus antibody-positive, nucleic acid test-negative (HCV Ab+/NAT-) livers into nonviremic HCV recipients can expand the donor pool. Having previously described the sentinel experience of HCV Ab+/NAT- allografts in nonviremic recipients, we report the growth and extended follow-up of this program for 55 patients compared with recipients of Public Health Services (PHS) increased-risk donor HCV Ab-/NAT- allografts.STUDY DESIGN: A prospective review of all HCV nonviremic LTx patients receiving HCV Ab+/NAT- organs between March 2016 and August 2018 was performed. All HCV Ab+/NAT- organ recipients underwent HCV testing at 3 months and 1-year post-LTx to determine HCV transmission.RESULTS: Fifty-five HCV nonviremic candidates received HCV Ab+/NAT- organs; 64% male, median age 59 years (range 36 to 69 years) and median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score of 22.5. Two recipients were excluded due to death before HCV testing. The HCV disease transmission occurred in 5 recipients (9%). Of these, 4 (80%) underwent anti-HCV treatment with eradication of virus. No patient found to be negative at 3 months seroconverted at 1-year follow-up. No patients who received PHS increased-risk donor HCV Ab-/NAT- organs had viremia develop (0 of 57) and there was no difference in graft and renal function, complications, or survival between HCV Ab+/NAT- recipients and PHS increased-risk donor HCV Ab-/NAT- recipients.CONCLUSIONS: We report the largest experience with LTx from HCV Ab+/NAT- donors into 55 seronegative recipients with a HCV transmission rate of 9% with no late conversions at 1 year and no difference in function or graft loss compared with PHS increased-risk donor HCV Ab-/NAT- recipients. Due to availability of safe and effective HCV therapies, the use of such organs should be strongly considered to increase the donor organ pool. (C) 2018 by the American College of Surgeons.

TI  - A highly automated algorithm for wetland detection using multi-temporal optical satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are valuable ecosystems providing a variety of important ecosystem services such as food supply and flood control. Due to increasing anthropogenic influences and the impact of climate change, wetlands are increasingly threatened and degraded. An effective monitoring of wetlands is therefore necessary to preserve and restore these endangered ecosystems. Earth Observation (EO) data offer a great potential to support cost-effective and large-scale monitoring of wetlands. Current state-of-the-art methods for wetland mapping, however, require large training data and manual effort and can therefore only be locally applied. The focus of this study is to evaluate a methodology for large-scale and highly automated wetland mapping based on current EO data streams. For this purpose, an algorithm for water and wetness detection based on multi-temporal optical imagery and topographic data is presented. Suitable spectral indices sensitive to water and wetness were identified using feature selection methods based on mutual information between optical indices and occurrence of water and wetness. In combination with the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), these were used to derive monthly water and wetness masks using a dynamic thresholding approach. Aggregating all observations corrected for seasonal bias yielded flooding and wetness frequencies and the Water Wetness Presence (or Probability) Index (WWPI) as an indicator for wetland occurrence or a pre-inventory. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, the algorithm is demonstrated at three study sites with different wetland types in Kenya/Uganda, Algeria, and Austria using Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) imagery. For all sites, the overall accuracy was above 92%. User's and producer's accuracies were higher for water (> 96%) than for wetness (> 75%). Due to the high degree of automation and low processing time, the proposed method is applicable on a large scale and has already been applied during the production of the Copernicus High Resolution Water-Wetness Layer and within the European Space Agency (ESA) project GlobWetland Africa.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Monitoring of Pasture Ecological Quality: Sentinel-2-Based Estimation of Crude Protein and Neutral Detergent Fiber Contents
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent, region-wide monitoring of changes in pasture quality due to human disturbances or climatic conditions is impossible by field measurements or traditional ecological surveying methods. Remote sensing imagery offers distinctive advantages for monitoring spatial and temporal patterns. The chemical parameters that are widely used as indicators of ecological quality are crude protein (CP) content and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content. In this study, we investigated the relationship between CP, NDF, and reflectance in the visible-near-infrared-shortwave infrared (VIS-NIR-SWIR) spectral range, using field, laboratory measurements, and satellite imagery (Sentinel-2). Statistical models were developed using different calibration and validation data sample sets: (1) a mix of laboratory and field measurements (e.g., fresh and dry vegetation) and (2) random selection. In addition, we used three vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI), Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI)) as proxies to CP and NDF estimation. The best models found for predicting CP and NDF contents were based on reflectance measurements (R-2 = 0.71, RMSEP = 2.1% for CP; and R-2 = 0.78, RMSEP = 5.5% for NDF). These models contained fresh and dry vegetation samples in calibration and validation data sets. Random sample selection in a model generated similar accuracy estimations. Our results also indicate that vegetation indices provide poor accuracy. Eight Sentinel-2 images (December 2015-April 2017) were examined in order to better understand the variability of vegetation quality over spatial and temporal scales. The spatial and temporal patterns of CP and NDF contents exhibit strong seasonal dependence, influenced by climatological (precipitation) and topographical (northern vs. southern hillslopes) conditions. The total CP/NDF content increases/decrease (respectively) from December to March, when the concentrations reach their maximum/minimum values, followed by a decline/incline that begins in April, reaching minimum values in July.

TI  - Duffy blood group system - the frequency of Duffy antigen polymorphisms and novel mutations in the Polish population
T2  - TRANSFUSION AND APHERESIS SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Duffy blood group genes are highly polymorphic with the distribution of alleles varying between different populations and ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to genotype Duffy blood group antigens and to establish FY alleles frequency in the Polish population and screen for novel FY gene mutations. Duffy phenotype and genotype frequencies analysis was based on studies of 596 persons. All these subjects were genotyped by high-resolution melting (HRM) method. It was shown that phenotype Fy(a + b +), defined by genotypes FY*A/FY*B (33%), FY*A/FY*B298A (13%), and FY*A/FY*02VV.01 (2.8 /0) was the most common in Polish population ((-)49%), followed by Fy(a - b +),(similar to)29%, determined by genotypes arising from FY*B allele and all its variants. Fy (a + b-) phenotype occurred with a frequency of 21.3% and was defined by the following genotypes: FY*A/A (21%), and FY*A/02N.01 (0.3%). Among the Polish population the frequencies of FY*A, FY*B, and FY*B298A alleles were 45.7%, 36% and 15.5%, respectively. The alleles FY*B298A and FY*B combined together, represented higher frequency (51%) than FY*A. Alleles FY*02W.01 and FY*02N.01 had frequencies 2.51% and 0.25%, respectively. The distribution of Duffy genotypes in the Polish population was in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p = 0.9682). Alleles in the genotypes are independent from each other (r = 0.0278, R-2 = 0.00077). New mutations identified in the promoter region (c.-79T > C) and the coding region of the FY gene (c.147C > A and c.175 G > A) did not affect the Duffy antigen expression on erythrocyte. Although FY alleles frequency is known in different populations, no data for Polish population is available.

TI  - Miners and mendicants: A cautionary tale
T2  - EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper posits that the existence of informal miners is indicative of and correlated to government institutionality which is defined as the degree to which local and regional governments are operative in the area of interest. It is further asserted that the degree of government institutionality may impact the infrastructure benefits solicited from resource companies by the affected communities. A mendicant relationship may develop if the infrastructure solicited includes things such as police, justice, medical and educational facilities that are best maintained by local or regional governments. The asymmetry of power between the two parties may subsequently lead to unfulfilled expectations, violence and issues with social license.A database of the incidence of informal mining and the economic freedom indicators for 15 countries is used to correlate informal mining with government insitutionality and the paper offers thoughts for consideration regarding issues to understand and address when considering operations in developing countries.

TI  - Altimeter Observation-Based Eddy Nowcasting Using an Improved Conv-LSTM Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eddies can be identified and tracked based on satellite altimeter data. However, few studies have focused on nowcasting the evolution of eddies using remote sensing data. In this paper, an improved Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Conv-LSTM) network named Prednet is used for eddy nowcasting. Prednet, which uses a deep, recurrent convolutional network with both bottom-up and top-down connects, has the ability to learn the temporal and spatial relationships associated with time series data. The network can effectively simulate and reconstruct the spatiotemporal characteristics of the future sea level anomaly (SLA) data. Based on the SLA data products provided by Archiving, Validation, and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic (AVISO) from 1993 to 2018, combined with an SLA-based eddy detection algorithm, seven-day eddy nowcasting experiments are conducted on the eddies in South China Sea. The matching ratio is defined as the percentage of true eddies that can be successfully predicted by Conv-LSTM network. On the first day of the nowcasting, matching ratio for eddies with diameters greater than 100 km is 95%, and the average matching ratio of the seven-day nowcasting is approximately 60%. In order to verify the performance of nowcasting method, two experiments were set up. A typical anticyclonic eddy shedding from Kuroshio in January 2017 was used to verify this nowcasting algorithm's performance on single eddy, with the mean eddy center error is 11.2 km. Moreover, compared with the eddies detected in the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model data set (HYCOM), the eddies predicted with Conv-LSTM networks are closer to the eddies detected in the AVISO SLA data set, indicating that deep learning method can effectively nowcast eddies.

TI  - Integrating Growth and Environmental Parameters to Discriminate Powdery Mildew and Aphid of Winter Wheat Using Bi-Temporal Landsat-8 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and discriminating co-epidemic diseases and pests at regional scales are of practical importance in guiding differential treatment. A combination of vegetation and environmental parameters could improve the accuracy for discriminating crop diseases and pests. Different diseases and pests could cause similar stresses and symptoms during the same crop growth period, so combining growth period information can be useful for discerning different changes in crop diseases and pests. Additionally, problems associated with imbalanced data often have detrimental effects on the performance of image classification. In this study, we developed an approach for discriminating crop diseases and pests based on bi-temporal Landsat-8 satellite imagery integrating both crop growth and environmental parameters. As a case study, the approach was applied to data during a period of typical co-epidemic outbreak of winter wheat powdery mildew and aphids in the Shijiazhuang area of Hebei Province, China. Firstly, bi-temporal remotely sensed features characterizing growth indices and environmental factors were calculated based on two Landsat-8 images. The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm was used to resample the imbalanced training data set before model construction. Then, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) based on a new training data set balanced by the SMOTE approach (SMOTE-BPNN) was developed to generate the regional wheat disease and pest distribution maps. The original training data set-based BPNN and support vector machine (SVM) methods were used for comparison and testing of the initial results. Our findings suggest that the proposed approach incorporating both growth and environmental parameters of different crop periods could distinguish wheat powdery mildew and aphids at the regional scale. The bi-temporal growth indices and environmental factors-based SMOTE-BPNN, BPNN, and SVM models all had an overall accuracy high than 80%. Meanwhile, the SMOTE-BPNN method had the highest G-means among the three methods. These results revealed that the combination of bi-temporal crop growth and environmental parameters is essential for improving the accuracy of the crop disease and pest discriminating models. The combination of SMOTE and BPNN could effectively improve the discrimination accuracy of the minor disease or pest.

TI  - Centroid and Covariance Alignment-Based Domain Adaptation for Unsupervised Classification of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new domain adaptation algorithm based on the class centroid and covariance alignment (CCCA) is proposed for classification of remote sensing images. This approach exploits both the first- and second-order statistics to describe the data distribution and aligns the data distribution between domains on a per-class basis. Since the predicted labels of target data are used to estimate the two statistics, we applied overall centroid alignment (OCA) as a coarse domain adaptation strategy to improve the estimation accuracy. In addition, the OCA coarse adaptation in conjunction with CCCA refined adaptation can also benefit by incorporation of spatial information, resulting in a Spa_OCA_CCCA approach. The proposed approach is easy to implement, and only one parameter is required in the spatial filtering step. It does not require labeled information in the target domain and can achieve labor-free classification. The experimental results using Hyperion, National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping, and Worldview-2 remote sensing images demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - The Representativeness of Air Quality Monitoring Sites in the Urban Areas of a Mountainous City
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lanzhou is a typical mountainous city with severe air pollution in northwestern China. This study uses hourly observational data of air pollutants at five air quality monitoring sites in Lanzhou from July to December 2015 to discuss data quality control and the representativeness of the monitoring sites (four urban sites and one suburban site). A fuzzy matrix is applied to study primary air pollutants. The results show that of the six routinely monitored pollutants, the primary pollutant is PM10 during the study period. Based on lag correlation analysis and one-way analysis of variance, it is concluded that there are redundant observations at the four urban sites for the timely diffusion and transport of air pollutants from the same general area. The coefficient of divergence (COD) method is then used to evaluate the spatial distribution differences, and the primary air pollutant PM10 shows differences at each site. COD can be used as a positive indicator to describe site representativeness. To evaluate the overall air pollution in the valley, correlation analysis is performed between the PM10 concentration retrieved from aerosol optical depth satellite data and the concentration from the four urban monitoring sites. Among these, the correlation between the workers' hospital site data and the retrieval data is the highest, passing the 90% confidence level. A new representative evaluation model for air quality monitoring sites, R-S = 0.77COD + 0.23R(retrieval), is established by using COD and correlation coefficients between routine observations and satellite retrieval products. From this model, it can be concluded that the biological products institute site in Lanzhou is the most representative site for the evaluation of air pollution out of the four urban air quality monitoring sites from July to December 2015.

TI  - Evolution and prediction of land cover and biodiversity function in Loess Hilly Region.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted explore the evolution of land cover and biodiversity function in the Loess Hilly Region, evaluate the optimal habitat under the perspective of biodiversity conservation, using Pengyang County of Ningxia as the research area, by using Landsat TM images of every 5 years from 1995 to 2015 as the basic data. The 3S technology was used to integrate the characteristics of spatio-temporal dynamics of land cover. From June to August of 2012 and 2013, sample data of ground beetles were collected in 6 different habitats, such as mixed forestland of shrub and grass and mixed forestland of arbor and shrub using the trapping method. The biodiversity function was evaluated using the InVEST-Habitat Quality model, and the best habitat was explored using sampling data. Moreover, land cover and biodiversity function in 2020 were predicted using the CA. Markov model. The result showed that: (1) The land cover and biological diversity of Pengyang County changed significantly from 1995 to 2015, unused land area decreased, urban land rapidly expanded, and natural enclosed grassland and horizontal farmland in the habitat clearly changed; biodiversity function transformed from degradation to optimization during the study period, from which the best biodiversity function was observed in 2015. (2) Compared to 2015, we predicted that the horizontal farmland and urban land of land cover significantly changed in 2020 and the biodiversity function rapidly improved. (3) The mixed forestland of shrub and grass was the best habitat for biodiversity conservation of Pengyang County. The traditional "88542" horizontal ditch of land preparation measure in the habitat may be the best model for ecological restoration in the local area. (4) We observed good universality and high accuracy by utilizing the InVEST model and CA. Markov model, respectively; The implementation and construction of not only soil and water conservation projects, including horizontal ditch, fish scale pit, and "88542", but also ecological restoration strategies such as returning farmland to forest and grass and ecological function zoning are very important and will show remarkable results.

TI  - Formation of pedestalled, relict lakes on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface debris covers much of the western portion of the McMurdo Ice Shelf and has a strong influence on the local surface albedo and energy balance. Differential ablation between debris-covered and debris-free areas creates an unusual heterogeneous surface of topographically low, high-ablation, and topographically raised ('pedestalled'), low-ablation areas. Analysis of Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery from 1999 to 2018, alongside field observations from the 2016/2017 austral summer, shows that pedestalled relict lakes ('pedestals') form when an active surface meltwater lake that develops in the summer, freezes-over in winter, resulting in the lake-bottom debris being masked by a high-albedo, superimposed, ice surface. If this ice surface fails to melt during a subsequent melt season, it experiences reduced surface ablation relative to the surrounding debris-covered areas of the ice shelf. We propose that this differential ablation, and resultant hydrostatic and flexural readjustments of the ice shelf, causes the former supraglacial lake surface to become increasingly pedestalled above the lower topography of the surrounding ice shelf. Consequently, meltwater streams cannot flow onto these pedestalled features, and instead divert around them. We suggest that the development of pedestals has a significant influence on the surface-energy balance, hydrology and flexure of the ice shelf.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 71st Annual Cancer Symposium of the Society-of-Surgical-Oncology (SSO)
CL  - Chicago, IL
AB  - Background: The optimal management of melanoma with positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) remains unclear. Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) only yields additional positive non-SLN in 20% of cases and its benefits on survival remains debatable.Methods: An online database search of Medline was performed; key bibliographies were reviewed. Studies comparing outcomes after CLND versus observation were included. Odds ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by random fixed effects models of pooled data were calculated. The primary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS), melanoma-specific survival (MSS), and overall survival (OS).Results: Search strategy yielded 117 publications. Twelve studies were selected for inclusion, comprising 7966 SLN-positive patients. Among these patients, 5306 (66.6%) subjects underwent CLND and 2660 (33.4%) patients were observed. Median Breslow thickness and ulceration were similar between groups (2.8 +/- 0.6 mm versus 2.5 +/- 0.8 mm, P = 0.721; and 38.8% versus 37.2%, P = 0.136, CLND versus observation, respectively). CLND was associated with statistically significant improved 3-y (71.0% versus 66.2%, OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.97, P = 0.02) and 5-y DFS (48.3% versus 47.8%, OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.96, P = 0.02) compared with observation. However, no difference was demonstrated in 3-y MSS (83.7% versus 84.7%, OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88- 1.35, P = 0.41), 5-y MSS (68.4% versus 69.8%, OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88-1.19, P = 0.78), or OS (68.2% versus 78.9%, OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.55-1.57, P = 0.78).Conclusions: Based on this large-scale analysis, CLND improved both 3- and 5-y DFS, possibly because of increased rates of local control; however, this did not translate in improved MSS or OS. Efforts toward the identification of molecular markers associated with poor outcomes in SLN-positive patients who undergo observation are warranted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Neurophenomenology and Neoplatonism
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE PLATONIC TRADITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The worldview emerging from neurophenomenology is consistent with the phenomenological insights obtained by Neoplatonic theurgical operations. For example, gods and daimons are phenomenologically equivalent to the archetypes and complexes investigated in Jungian psychology and explicated by evolutionary psychology. Jung understood the unconscious mind and physical reality to have a common root in an unus mundus (with physical and psychical aspects). Parallel reductions in the phenomenological and neurological domain imply elementary constituents of consciousness associated with simple physical systems, that is, natural processes experienced both externally (objectively) and internally (subjectively). Analysis reveals they have both an eternal formal structure and a material substrate that allows the formal structure to evolve in time with both phenomenal and physical aspects. Since all physical processes fit this description, a form of panpsychism is implied. These developments can inform our understanding of the Forms, the World Soul, and individual souls in Neoplatonism.

TI  - Customization of the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model over the Singapore region: impact of planetary boundary layer schemes, land use, land cover and model horizontal grid resolution
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate simulations of surface meteorological variables are important for the transport and dispersion of air pollutants and air quality in the lower atmosphere. In the present study, the surface meteorological variables over Singapore were simulated using the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) mesoscale model. The sensitivity tests were conducted with six different planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes (Yonsei University, Mellor-Yamada-Janjic, University of Washington, Asymmetric Convective Model version 2 [ACM2], Bougeault-Lacarrere, Quasi-Normal Scale Elimination), four different horizontal grid resolutions (27, 9, 3 and 1 km) and two different land use, land cover datasets (US Geological Survey [USGS] and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer [MODIS]). Eight days (January 20-28, 2015) were selected for the WRF-ARW model simulations for simulating surface meteorological variables. The model results were validated with available observations over the Singapore region. A lower mean bias, mean absolute error and root mean square error and good correlation were found in calculating surface meteorological variables with increase in the WRF-ARW model horizontal resolution up to 3 km. Further, MODIS land use, land cover datasets considerably improved the prediction of surface meteorological variables compared to the USGS for all PBL schemes and horizontal grid resolutions. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the surface meteorological variables simulated using the ACM2 PBL scheme with 3 km horizontal grid resolution with MODIS land use, land cover data are in better agreement with observations with less error and a good correlation coefficient. The better performance by ACM2 could be due to non-local turbulence closure during unstable conditions and local closure during the stable and neutral conditions formulated in this scheme. Overall, this study indicates possibilities to improve regional level air quality monitoring and prediction capabilities over Singapore.

TI  - Tick -Borne Relapsing Fever in the White Mountains, Arizona, USA, 2013-2018
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is a bacterial infection transmitted by tick bites that occurs in several different parts of the world, including the western United States. We describe 6 cases of TBRF acquired in the White Mountains of Arizona, USA, and diagnosed during 2013-2018. All but 1 case-patient had recurrent fever, and some had marked laboratory abnormalities, including leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated aminotransaminases. One patient had uveitis. Diagnosis was delayed in 5 of the cases; all case-patients responded to therapy with doxycydine. Two patients had Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions. The White Mountains of Arizona have not been previously considered a region of high incidence for TBRF. These 6 cases likely represent a larger number of cases that might have been undiagnosed. Clinicians should be aware of TBRF in patients who reside, recreate, or travel to this area and especially for those who sleep overnight in cabins there.

TI  - Groundwater Potential Mapping in a Rural River Basin by Union (OR) and Intersection (AND) of Four Multi-criteria Decision-Making Models
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Targeting groundwater in the river basin like Chandrabhaga with seasonal drought is a very urgent task especially for mitigating irrigation demand during the non-monsoon period. This paper delineated suitable groundwater potential zones based on the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), modified AHP, PCA-based weight and knowledge-based weight of multiple input parameters. For providing more certainty of the target zones in the derived models, union and intersection of all models were performed. A GIS-based multi-criteria approach using 13 relevant parameters has been adopted in this work. From the first four models, it is found that very suitable areas vary from 7.5 to 11% of the total basin area. The union and intersection models of the four individual models, respectively, delineated 13.91% and 3.69% suitable areas. Among the six models, the average yield of groundwater (5.96L/s) is maximum in case of the intersection model, which is, therefore, more reliable than others. In case of the union model, the suitable area has 0.2L/s less average yield than the intersection model. Therefore, for the harvesting more water, very good potential area delineated in the intersection model can be targeted. All these models will nevertheless help decision-makers to judge whether the existing groundwater harvesting structures are located properly or whether reorientation is needed.

TI  - STATUS OF BLUETONGUE DISEASE IN INDIA
T2  - EVERYMANS SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bluetongue Virus (BTV) is devastating hemorrhagic viral disease of both wild and domestic ruminants, classified among category "A" diseases notifiable to the World Organization of animal Health (OIE). The vector of the disease is biting midges of genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) and the disease is characterized by high morbidity and mortality resulting severe economic losses to sheep farmers. Over the five decades after the first report of BT in 1964, most of the known serotypes of Bluetongue Virus (BTV) have been reported by detection of serotype specific antibodies and rarely by virus isolation from the fly.Although virus isolation and serotyping are the gold standards, rapid method based on the detection of the viral nucleic acid may be more suitable for India, yet for effective control of BT may be pertinent to introduce sentinel and vector traps systems for identification of the circulating serotypes and to evaluate herd immunity against them, so that relevant strains can be included in vaccine formulations. Recently, an inactivated pentavalent vaccine (BTV-1, 2, 10, 16 & 23) is developed and commercialized in India(3).

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation analysis of urban land expansion in the establishment of new communities in Upper Egypt: A case study of New Asyut city
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Egyptian government set out in the 1970s to establish new cities in the desert to absorb urban sprawl and to prevent further depletion of agricultural lands. Despite such efforts, this policy has not met with much success. In the present study, LANDSAT satellite imagery and binary logistic regression analysis were employed to investigate the nature of urban sprawl in one of the most important cities in Egypt, Asyut city, as well as the area connecting it to New Asyut city by quantifying the interaction between the driving forces of land use/cover change. Various socioeconomic factors associated with land control policy were examined. The results indicated that whereas directing urban development towards the new city created a semblance of balance initially, the rate of land development in the study area outstripped the rate of population growth, especially in the new city. While establishment of the new city boosted early urban development, further development in the regions outside the Nile valley was not sustained due to a lack of supportive governmental policies. Consequently, urban residents moved back inside the valley to re-settle on agricultural lands adjacent to the old urban cores. This study is the first to quantify the driving forces of land use in this region. It offers useful data to guide planned and purposeful expansion of urban land by government policy-makers in their effort to curb urban sprawl and prevent further encroachment on agricultural land in Egypt.

TI  - Identification of groundwater potential zones of the Kumari river basin, India: an RS & GISbased semi-quantitative approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is envisaged as a valuable common resource. In the present day, groundwater is declining very rapidly due to human intervention. Stress on groundwater in the semiarid locale of West Bengal, especially in Purulia district, is very high due to immense demand and overexploitation. The fundamental goal of the study is to discover potential groundwater zones for the appraisal of groundwater availability in the Kumari river basin, India. Survey of India topographical maps, elevation data (ASTER DEM 30m), satellite imageries (Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2) and Google Earth images were analyzed using RS-GIS software (ArcGIS 10.3, ERDAS IMAGINE 9.2, MicroImages TNT MIP Pro 2016) to prepare various thematic data layers like altitude, slope angle, drainage density, geomorphology, soil type, geology, land use/land cover, lineament density, distance from rivers and mean annual rainfall. All prepared maps were changed with GIS software utilizing the raster converter apparatus in the raster space. Weighted layer for each thematic data layer was statistically computed by assigning weight values to individual parameters. Class rank was assigned in light of their significance to underground water recharge. Finally, a groundwater potential zone map was prepared utilizing analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and five distinct zones were arranged accordingly. ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curve and groundwater depth map were prepared using the field data to validate the groundwater zonation map of the Kumari river basin.

TI  - Land use change in the high mountain belts of the central Apennines led to marked changes of the grassland mosaic
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims High mountain pastures are hotspots of biodiversity, but grazing cessation and climate change are causing tall-grass encroachment and expansion of scrublands and forests. As part of biodiversity conservation efforts, grassland variation needs to be investigated at different spatial scales. We aimed to assess the landscape mosaic variation that occurred between 1988 and 2015 in the higher Mediterranean mountains. We investigated the recovery or land-degradation processes related to land use change, the effects of site condition, the impacts on grassland mosaic heterogeneity, and the threats to biodiversity. Location Sibillini Mountains (central Italy), over 1,650 m a.s.l. Methods We used two-step object-based supervised classification on Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images to analyze changes in landscape patterns and vegetation cover on formerly low-intensity pastures, by assessing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index variation between 1988 and 2015. Twenty percent of the polygons obtained from segmentation were visually interpreted and assigned to five land cover classes. We generated a land use transition matrix and used Fourier Transforms to detect trends in variation of landscape mosaics and fragmentation. Results We observed prominent dynamics of the grassland mosaic leading to the homogenization of its structure through decreasing patch heterogeneity, especially on south-facing slopes. Grasslands shifted from open communities to dense pastures, with a reduction of scree and spread of tall grasses. The former trend could be understood as a recovery process reverting screes to conditions in equilibrium with local landform and climatic features, while the invasion of tall grasses is a land-degradation process that might lead to local species extinction and loss of habitat connectivity. Conclusions Pronounced changes in the large-scale landscape characteristics, mainly due to land use changes, of which scientists and managers of protected areas are not fully aware, are underway in the top mountain sectors of the study area.

TI  - Cross-Network Directory Service: Infrastructure to enable collaborations across distributed research networks
T2  - LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Existing large-scale distributed health data networks are disconnected even as they address related questions of healthcare research and public policy. This paper describes the design and implementation of a fully functional prototype open-source tool, the Cross-Network Directory Service (CNDS), which addresses much of what keeps distributed networks disconnected from each other. Methods The set of services needed to implement a Cross-Directory Service was identified through engagement with stakeholders and workgroup members. CNDS was implemented using PCORnet and Sentinel network instances and tested by participating data partners. Results Web services that enable the four major functional features of the service (registration, discovery, communication, and governance) were developed and placed into an open-source repository. The services include a robust metadata model that is extensible to accommodate a virtually unlimited inventory of metadata fields, without requiring any further software development. The user interfaces are programmatically generated based on the contents of the metadata model. Conclusion The CNDS pilot project gathered functional requirements from stakeholders and collaborating partners to build a software application to enable cross-network data and resource sharing. The two partners-one from Sentinel and one from PCORnet-tested the software. They successfully entered metadata about their organizations and data sources and then used the Discovery and Communication functionality to find data sources of interest and send a cross-network query. The CNDS software can help integrate disparate health data networks by providing a mechanism for data partners to participate in multiple networks, share resources, and seamlessly send queries across those networks.

TI  - Cloud Masking Technique for High-Resolution Satellite Data: An Artificial Neural Network Classifier Using Spectral & Textural Context
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud masking is a very important application in remote sensing and an essential pre-processing step for any information derivation applications. It helps in estimation of usable portion of the images. Many popular spectral classification techniques rely upon the presence of a short-wave infrared band or bands of even higher wavelength to differentiate between clouds and other land covers. However, these methods are limited to sensors equipped with higher wavelength bands. In this paper, a generic and efficient technique is attempted using the Cartosat-2 series (C2S) satellite which is having high-resolution multispectral sensor in the visible and near-infrared bands. The methodology is based on textural features from the available spectral context, and using a feedforward neural network for the classification is proposed. The method was shown to have an overall accuracy of 97.98% for a large manually pre-classified validation dataset with more than 2 million data points. Experimental results and cloud masks generated for various scenes show that the method may be viable as a reasonable cloud masking algorithm for C2S data.

TI  - Metric Accuracy of Digital Elevation Models from WorldView-3 Stereo-Pairs in Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - WorldView-3 satellite is providing images with an unprecedented combination of high spatial and spectral resolution. The stereo capabilities and the very high resolution of the panchromatic band (0.31 m) have been fostering new applications in urban areas, where the complexity of the morphology requires a higher level of detail. The present technical note aims to test the accuracy of digital elevation models that can be obtained by WorldView-3 stereo-pairs in these particular contexts, with an operational state-of-the-art algorithm. Validation is performed using check points and existing models of the area (from LiDAR data and oblique aerial images). The experiments, conducted over the city of Bologna (Italy) with six images, proved that roof surfaces and open spaces can be reconstructed with an average error of 1-2 pixels, but severe discrepancies frequently occur in narrow roads and urban canyons (up to several metres in average). The level of completeness achievable with only one pair is extremely variable (ranging from 50% to 90%), due to the combined effect of the geometry of acquisition and the specific urban texture. Better results can be obtained by using more than one pair. Furthermore, smaller convergence angles can be beneficial for the reconstruction of specific urban structures, such as soaring towers.

TI  - Integrating Sentinel-1A SAR data and GIS to estimate aboveground biomass and carbon accumulation for tropical forest types in Thuan Chau district, Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon accumulation (CAc) from remote sensing data is a practical approach for long-term monitoring quality of forest, which assist the forest management and environmental sustainability. This study presents the use of Sentinel-1A SAR data for retrieving environmental parameters to estimate the spatial variability of AGB and CAc in Thuan Chau district, Son La province, Vietnam. Univariate and multivariate linear regression models were performed by using input from field survey data and forest-covered map acquired in 2015. In total, 240 plots were collected and 168 plots were used in the regression models; the remaining 72 plots were used to validate the results. Quality control was conducted by comparing the coefficient of determination (R squared - R-2) of two methods, and the best-fit model was chosen to estimate the carbon accumulation accurately. The correlation coefficient of the multivariate linear regression model was more satisfied than the other method with R-2 = 0.48 and R-2 = 0.37 respectively. The results of carbon accumulation were mainly distributed in the evergreen broadleaf forest, accounting for about 66.8% of the total area. This approach is an effective way to use free accessible satellite data in estimating AGB and CAc in the tropical regions.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Regression Algorithms for Cotton Leaf Area Index Retrieval Using Sentinel-2 Spectral Bands
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a crucial crop biophysical parameter that has been widely used in a variety of fields. Five state-of-the-art machine learning regression algorithms (MLRAs), namely, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), random forest (RF) and gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), have been used in the retrieval of cotton LAI with Sentinel-2 spectral bands. The performances of the five machine learning models are compared for better applications of MLRAs in remote sensing, since challenging problems remain in the selection of MLRAs for crop LAI retrieval, as well as the decision as to the optimal number for the training sample size and spectral bands to different MLRAs. A comprehensive evaluation was employed with respect to model accuracy, computational efficiency, sensitivity to training sample size and sensitivity to spectral bands. We conducted the comparison of five MLRAs in an agricultural area of Northwest China over three cotton seasons with the corresponding field campaigns for modeling and validation. Results show that the GBRT model outperforms the other models with respect to model accuracy in average ( = 0.854, = 0.674 and = 0.456). SVR achieves the best performance in computational efficiency, which means it is fast to train, and to validate that it has great potentials to deliver near-real-time operational products for crop management. As for sensitivity to training sample size, GBRT behaves as the most robust model, and provides the best model accuracy on the average among the variations of training sample size, compared with other models 0.452). Spectral bands sensitivity analysis with dCor (distance correlation), combined with the backward elimination approach, indicates that SVR, GPR and RF provide relatively robust performance to the spectral bands, while ANN outperforms the other models in terms of model accuracy on the average among the reduction of spectral bands .480). A comprehensive evaluation indicates that GBRT is an appealing alternative for cotton LAI retrieval, except for its computational efficiency. Despite the different performance of the ML models, all models exhibited considerable potential for cotton LAI retrieval, which could offer accurate crop parameters information timely and accurately for crop fields management and agricultural production decisions.

TI  - Changes in Global Cloud Cover Based on Remote Sensing Data from 2003 to 2012
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As is well known, clouds impact the radiative budget, climate change, hydrological processes, and the global carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycles. To understand the wide-ranging effects of clouds, it is necessary to assess changes in cloud cover at high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we calculate global cloud cover during the day and at night using cloud products estimated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Results indicate that the global mean cloud cover from 2003 to 2012 was 66%. Moreover, global cloud cover increased over this recent decade. Specifically, cloud cover over land areas (especially North America, Antarctica, and Europe) decreased (slope =-0.001, R-2 = 0.5254), whereas cloud cover over ocean areas (especially the Indian and Pacific Oceans) increased (slope = 0.0011, R-2 = 0.4955). Cloud cover is relatively high between the latitudes of 36 degrees S and 68 degrees S compared to other regions, and cloud cover is lowest over Oceania and Antarctica. The highest rates of increase occurred over Southeast Asia and Oceania, whereas the highest rates of decrease occurred over Antarctica and North America. The global distribution of cloud cover regulates global temperature change, and the trends of these two variables over the 10-year period examined in this study (2003-2012) oppose one another in some regions. These findings are very important for studies of global climate change.

TI  - Object-based forest gaps classification using airborne LiDAR data
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Object-based classification differentiates forest gaps from canopies at large regional scale by using remote sensing data. To study the segmentation and classification processes of object-based forest gaps classification at a regional scale, we sampled a natural secondary forest in northeast China at Maoershan Experimental Forest Farm. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR; 3.7 points/m(2)) data were collected as the original data source and the canopy height model (CHM) and topographic dataset were extracted from the LiDAR data. The accuracy of object-based forest gaps classification depends on previous segmentation. Thus our first step was to define 10 different scale parameters in CHM image segmentation. After image segmentation, the machine learning classification method was used to classify three kinds of object classes, namely, forest gaps, tree canopies, and others. The common support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the radial basis function kernel (RBF) was first adopted to test the effect of classification features (vegetation height features and some typical topographic features) on forest gap classification. Then the different classifiers (KNN, Bayes, decision tree, and SVM with linear kernel) were further adopted to compare the effect of classifiers on machine learning forest gaps classification. Segmentation accuracy and classification accuracy were evaluated by using Moller's method and confusion metrics, respectively. The scale parameter had a significant effect on object-based forest gap segmentation and classification. Classification accuracies at different scales revealed that there were two optimal scales (10 and 20) that provided similar accuracy, with the scale of 10 yielding slightly greater accuracy than 20. The accuracy of the classification by using combination of height features and SVM classifier with linear kernel was 91% at the optimal scale parameter of 10, and it was highest comparing with other classification classifiers, such as SVM RBF (90%), Decision Tree (90%), Bayes (90%), or KNN (87%). The classifiers had no significant effect on forest gap classification, but the fewer parameters in the classifier equation and higher speed of operation probably lead to a higher accuracy of final classifications. Our results confirm that object-based classification can extract forest gaps at a large regional scale with appropriate classification features and classifiers using LiDAR data. We note, however, that final satisfaction of forest gap classification depends on the determination of optimal scale (s) of segmentation.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The general topic here is the application of very high-resolution satellite imagery to the study of ocean phenomena having horizontal spatial scales of the order of 1 kilometer, which is the realm of the ocean submesoscale. The focus of the present study is the use of WorldView-2 along-track stereo imagery to probe a submesoscale feature in the Baltic Sea that consists of an apparent inward spiraling of surface aggregations of algae. In this case, a single pair of images is analyzed using an optical-flow velocity algorithm. Because such image data generally have a much lower dynamic range than in land applications, the impact of residual instrument noise (e.g., data striping) is more severe and requires attention; we use a simple scheme to reduce the impact of such noise. The results show that the spiral feature has at its core a cyclonic vortex, about 1 km in radius and having a vertical vorticity of about three times the Coriolis frequency. Analysis also reveals that an individual algal aggregation corresponds to a velocity front having both horizontal shear and convergence, while wind-accelerated clumps of surface algae can introduce fine-scale signatures into the velocity field. Overall, the analysis supports the interpretation of algal spirals as evidence of a submesoscale eddy and of algal aggregations as indicating areas of surface convergence.

TI  - Enhancing the retrieval of stream surface temperature from Landsat data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal images of water bodies often show a radiance gradient perpendicular to the banks. This effect is frequently due to mixed land and water thermal pixels. In the case of the Landsat images, radiance mixing can also affect pure water pixels due the cubic convolution resampling of the native thermal measurements. Some authors recommended a general-purpose margin of two thermal pixels to the banks or a minimum river width of three pixels, to avoid near bank effects in water temperature retrievals. Given the relatively course spatial resolution of satellite thermal sensors, the three pixel margin severely restricts their application to temperature mapping in many rivers. This study proposes a new algorithm to enhance the retrieval of stream surface temperature using Landsat 8 thermal data, although it is also applicable to Landsat 7 and Landsat 5. The aim is not to perform a subpixel radiance unmixing but to refine the selection of unmixed, reliable pixels for temperature mapping. For this purpose, the spatial arrangement of native Landsat thermal pixels is approximated, and pure water pixels in the downscaled thermal band are selected accordingly. The least-favourable cubic convolution near-bank radiance mixing is simulated on image basis. Only pure thermal water pixels unaffected by the simulated worst case resampling are selected. The algorithm allowed retrieving water surface temperature in reaches down to 120 m wide, clearly improving the existing three pixel, i.e. 300 m for Landsat 8, recommendation. The enhancing algorithm was applied to a reach in the Ebro River reach, Spain. It provided spatially distributed temperatures in narrow parts, upstream and downstream of a wide reservoir, offering new insight of the overall impact of the reservoir over the river thermal regime.

TI  - The Sangmelima granite-greenstone belts (South Cameroon): Integration of remote sensing and aeromagnetic data for structural interpretation
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of geology, geophysics and remote sensing data was used to map the Sangmelima granite-greenstone belt terrain located in the South Cameroon. The region was not easily accessible, because of dense vegetation and thick lateritic overburden. Aeromagnetic data were help in mapping new possible small greenstone belts and structural features in this area. Many of the identified lineaments are interpreted to represent fracture/fault zones, some of strike-slip faults. The NE-SW, NW-SE, N-S and E-W are the main revealed from remote sensing processing; while the NE-SW, E-W to ESE-WNW, NW-SE and N-S are the dominant structural trends revealed from aeromagnetic data. We distinguish three deformation events within the Sangmelima area: D-1 is recorded by a sub-vertical penetrative S-1 foliation bearing steeply plunging stretching lineations. D-2 overprints D-1 structures with tight-to-isoclinal folds with associated foliation, N160 degrees - 175 degrees E and N05 degrees - 25 degrees E ductile shear zones, indicating ENE-WSW shortening. The D-3 strike slip shearing is likely the result of the Eburnean deformation phase. The mafic dykes are striking NE-SW, N-S and NW-SE, and field evidence and airborne magnetic data suggest that some of them intrude preexisting structures. Many faults/fractures might have originated during previous deformation phases and they were only reactivated during the pan-African events.

TI  - Mangrove forests as traps for marine litter
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - To verify weather mangroves act as sinks for marine litter, we surveyed through visual census 20 forests along the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf, both in inhabited and remote locations. Anthropogenic debris items were counted and classified along transects, and the influence of main drivers of distribution were considered (i.e. land-based and ocean-based sources, density of the forest and properties of the object). We confirmed that distance to major maritime traffic routes significantly affects the density of anthropogenic debris in Red Sea mangrove forests, while this was independent of land-based activities. This suggests ocean-based activities combined with surface currents as major drivers of litter in this basin. Additionally, litter was more abundant where the mangrove density was higher, and object distribution through the mangrove stand often depended on their shape and dimension. We particularly show that pneumatophores act as a sieve retaining large plastic objects, leading to higher plastic mass estimates in mangroves compared to those of beaches previously surveyed in the Red Sea.

TI  - Efficient Dimensionality Reduction using Principal Component Analysis for Image Change Detection
T2  - IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection in image processing is the process of identifying differences by comparing images taken at different times. There are several digital change detection techniques; nevertheless, there is no universally optimal change detection methodology: the choice is dependent upon the application. Change detection methods based on multispectral space transformations like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) show good solutions for remote sensing applications. One advantage of PCA is in reducing data redundancy between bands and emphasizing different information in derived components. This work focus on the PCA exploitation for the SPOT multispectral image change detection. Thresholds are applied to the transformed image (PC2) to isolate the pixels that have changed. Thresholding methods require a decision as to where to place threshold boundaries in order to separate areas of change from those of no change. The accuracy of change detection maps that are derived with SPOT data is represented in terms of producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and overall accuracy, which are calculated from an error matrix (or confusion matrix). The obtained results have demonstrated solving efficiently the change detection problem.

TI  - A New Methodology for Rice Area Monitoring With COSMO-SkyMed HH-VV PingPong Mode SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to exploit a time series of COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) HH-VV SAR images to map rice fields and to estimate the sowing dates. The approach relies on multi-polarization features, i.e., the squared modulus of the HH and VV channels and the polarization ratio, extracted from CSK SAR scenes. The key step consists of extracting a rice training signature related to the multipolarization features. This signature allows estimating the sowing date that, at once, is used to refine the rice map obtained by the conventional interpretation of the CSK time series in terms of the scattering mechanisms of the different growing cycles. Experiments, carried out on a time series of 32 CSK images, collected from the Mekong Delta region, South Vietnam, confirm the soundness of the proposed methodology which is shown to provide results comparable to the ones obtained by a literature approach that exploits a similar dataset.

TI  - Multi-year comparison of the effects of spatial pattern of urban green spaces on urban land surface temperature
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban greening is increasingly viewed by cities worldwide as an effective measure to mitigate adverse impacts of urban heat island (UHI) effect. Despite the recognition of the possible influence of spatial pattern of urban green spaces (UGS) on their cooling effect by a small, yet growing body of literature, the results are inconsistent and inconclusive. This may be due to varying numbers and types of landscape metrics, and different statistical methods used in different studies, as well as scale-dependency of metrics and contextual differences between cities. We believe that comparative study across time and space using consistent methodology may overcome these challenges. We examined the relationships between spatial pattern and cooling effect of UGS in Singapore from 1973 to 2015 using a range of statistical and spatial methods. Landsat images were used to derive land cover and land surface temperature (LST) maps. Our results showed that: (1) four metrics of PLAND, SHAPE_AM, PD, and ENN_AM could effectively quantify UGS pattern and its relationships with LST across the years; (2) in addition to the amount of UGS (composition), four aspects of UGS configuration significantly influenced LST across the years namely, patch size, shape complexity, aggregation and fragmentation, and connectivity; (3) relative importance of composition versus configuration may depend on the existing UGS pattern; (4) relatively larger patches that are simpler in shape, more connected, and less fragmented were associated with lower LST. We discuss the significance of the results and insights they provide on optimizing UGS pattern for higher cooling effects.

TI  - Optical and physical properties, time-period, and severity of dust activities as a function of source for the main dust sources of the Middle East
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve long-time and comparable aerosol properties with the maximum geographical coverage possible in the Middle East, four AERONET sites (Kuwait university, Solar village, IASBS, and Mezaira) are selected. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 870 nm, Angstrom exponent (alpha) for two wavelengths, 440 and 870 nm, real and imaginary parts of aerosol refractive index at 870 nm (m(r), m(i)), and aerosol effective radius are studied for these sites during 2010-2017. Daily-mean values of aerosol properties (m(r) >= 1.51, m(i) <= 0.013, and alpha <= 0.88), show that dust particles are the dominant aerosol type in the atmosphere of the Middle East area. It has been seen that dusty days (daily-mean AOD(870) >= 0.50, and alpha <= 0.50), assign a notable percentage (14%-19%) of all days of data for all sites with the exception of the IASBS site. Based on the monthly-averaged MODIS-Terra Deep Blue AOD at 550 nm, it is seen four main dust sources in the Middle East: Mesopotamian area in Iraq and East Syria, northern part of the Arabian Peninsula, Elrob Elkhali desert at southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, and sources of East Arabian Peninsula located in Oman country. All sources of dust are active during dry months in spring and summer seasons. The monthly-averaged wind field data of ERA-interim ECMWF model reveals that dust events in northern part of the Arabian Peninsula are mainly originated from North Arabian Peninsula (Tigris-Euphrates basin) sources in spring (summer). In East Arabian Peninsula (Mezaira site), dusty conditions have continued until late summer and it is related to dust activities of sources, located at southern (Elrob Elkhali desert) and eastern part (Oman country) of the Arabian Peninsula. Dust recorded in Iran plateau (IASBS site), can be originated from sources of Tigris-Euphrates basin via westerly wind at higher altitudes. Also, it seems that dust particles originated from Tigris-Euphrates basin, have smaller sizes and higher values of complex refractive index and therefore it is essential to consider source functionality of dust particles optical and physical properties for each sub-region of the Middle East.

TI  - The Vegetation Structure Perpendicular Index (VSPI): A forest condition index for wildfire predictions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are a major natural hazard, causing substantial damage to infrastructure as well as being a risk to lives and homes. An understanding of their progression and behaviour is necessary to reduce risks and to develop operational management strategies in the event of an active fire. Many empirical fire-spread models have been developed to predict the spread and overall behaviour of a wildfire, based on a range of parameters such as weather and fuel conditions. However, these parameters may not be available with sufficient accuracy or spatiotemporal resolution to provide reliable fire spread predictions. Fuel condition data include variables such as vegetation quantity, structure and moisture content and, in the event of previous wildfires, the burn severity and stage of ecosystem recovery. In this study, an index called the Vegetation Structure Perpendicular Index (VSPI) is introduced. The VSPI utilises the short-wave infrared reflectance in bands centred at 1.6 and 2.2 pm, essentially representing the amount and structure of the vegetation's woody biomass (as opposed to the photosynthetic activity and moisture content). The VSPI is quantified as the divergence from a linear regression between the two bands in a time series and represents vegetation disturbance and recovery more reliably than indices such as the Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR) and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The VSPI index generally shows minor inter-annual variability and stronger post-wildfire detection of disturbance over a longer period than NBR and NDVI. The index is developed and applied to major wildfire events within eucalypt forests throughout southern Australia to estimate both burn severity and time to recovery. The VSPI can provide an improved information layer for fire risk evaluation and operational predictions of wildfire behaviour.

TI  - Climate change indirectly reduces breeding frequency of a mobile species through changes in food availability
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Trends of environmental change are influencing the behavior of many species across the world, while highly mobile species are disproportionately impacted by climate change and human modification. Here, we investigate the mechanisms behind climate change effects on the reproductive traits of highly mobile, West Australian bird taxa, the forest red-tailed black cockatoo Calyptorhynchus banksii naso (FRTBC). Using a dataset of annual breeding frequency spanning 19 yr, in combination with hydrological, climatological, and remotely sensed data, we modeled the effects of environmental variation on the annual breeding frequency of FRTBCs. We found several significant relationships between annual breeding frequency of FRTBCs and environmental variation. While the model, which induded a proxy for the availability of the cockatoo's primary food source and the previous season's rain, explained 49% of annual breeding frequency, there were also direct and indirect effects of heatwaves and forest productivity. Forest red-tailed black cockatoo breeding appears to be linked to the spatiotemporal availability of its primary food sources, the fruit from the tree species, marri Corymbia calophylla and jarrah Eucalyptus marginata. However, Western Australia is experiencing significant climate change, with increases in temperature and declines in rainfall altering the phenologies of these species, while declining rainfall is affecting the vegetation structure of the region. As drought events and temperatures are anticipated to increase over the region, it is expected that the food resources during the breeding season for cockatoos will become increasingly limited in time and space, thus threatening the persistence of this iconic species. This scenario is likely to be representative of many other situations where wide-ranging species rely on patchy food resources in a changing environment. As global biodiversity is increasingly threatened, this study presents timely evidence illustrating how climate change is affecting the persistence of a threatened, mobile species, and what the implications are for mobile species around the world.

TI  - Association of the New Peer Group-Stratified Method With the Reclassification of Penalty Status in the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Since the introduction of the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP), readmission penalties have been applied disproportionately to institutions that serve low-income populations. To address this concern, the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid introduced a new, stratified payment adjustment method in fiscal year (FY; October 1 to September 30) 2019.OBJECTIVE To determine whether the introduction of a new, stratified payment adjustment method was associated with an alteration in the distribution of penalties among hospitals included in the HRRP.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective cross-sectional study, US hospitals included in the HRRP for FY 2018 and FY 2019 were identified. Penalty status of participating hospitals for FY 2019 was determined based on nonstratified HRRP methods and the new, stratified payment adjustment method. Hospitals caring for the highest proportion of patients enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid based on quintile were assigned to the low-socioeconomic status (SES) group.EXPOSURES Nonstratified and stratified Centers for Medicare & Medicaid payment adjustment methods.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Net reclassification of penalties among all hospitals and hospitals in the low-SES group, in states participating in Medicaid expansion, and for 4 targeted medical conditions (acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumonia).RESULTS Penalty status by both payment adjustment methods (nonstratified and stratified) was available for 3173 hospitals. For FY 2019, the new, stratified payment method was associated with penalties for 75.04% of hospitals (2381 of 3173), while the old, nonstratified method was associated with penalties for 79.07%(2509 hospitals), resulting in a net down-classification in penalty status for all hospitals by 4.03 percentage points (95% CI, 2.95-5.11; P < .001). For the 634 low-SES hospitals in the sample, the new method was associated with penalties for 77.60% of hospitals (492 of 634), while the old method was associated with penalties for 91.64%(581 hospitals), resulting in a net down-classification in penalty status of 14.04 percentage points (95% CI, 11.18-16.90; P < .001). Among hospitals that were not low SES (quintiles 1-4), the new payment method was associated with a small decrease in penalty status (1928 vs 1889; net down-classification, 1.54 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.38-2.69; P = .01). Among target medical conditions, the greatest reduction in penalties was observed among cardiovascular conditions (net down-classification, 6.18 percentage points; 95% CI, 4.96-7.39; P < .001).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The new, stratified payment adjustment method for the HRRP was associated with a reduction in penalties across hospitals included in the program; the greatest reductions were observed among hospitals in the low-SES group, lessening but not eliminating the previously unbalanced penalty burden carried by these hospitals. Additional public policy research efforts are needed to achieve equitable payment adjustment models for all hospitals.

TI  - Clinical Value of Single-photon Emission Computed Tomography Combined With Computed Tomography for Sentinel Lymph Node Identification in Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and has the ability to metastasize widely. Accurate diagnosis of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) is crucial to its management. The gold standard for SLN identification is planar lymphoscintigraphy. Recently, single-photon emission computed tomography combined with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) has been used as a hybrid method to map lymphatic drainage networks. We aim to better characterize the utility of this tool in head and neck melanoma by evaluating its effectiveness in the preoperative setting for melanoma patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review at the West Haven Veterans Affairs Hospital. Inclusion criteria were patients with melanoma with a thickness greater than 0.75 mm and SPECT/CT use before operative sentinel lymph node excision. Exclusion criteria included clinically palpable lymph nodes, evidence of distant metastatic disease, melanoma with a Breslow depth less than 0.75 mm, and melanoma in situ. Our primary endpoints were correlation with intraoperative findings and whether the test had any influence on the operative plan.Results: Thirty-five patients between 2011 and 2017 met our criteria. SPECT/CT correlated with the sentinel node biopsy based on intraoperative lymphoscintigraphy in 30 (86%) of 35 cases, and there were no changes to the operative plan after SPECT/CT was performed. Sentinel lymph nodes were correctly identified in all 35 cases.Conclusions: The role of SPECT/CT in SLNB is uncertain. According to some studies, SPECT/CT can help decision making and change surgical approach in up to 35% of patients. However, other studies have reported questionable correlation with intraoperative findings and no added intraoperative value in over 50% of patients. We have demonstrated that preoperative SPECT/CT was consistent with intraoperative findings in 86.0% of cases but did not change the surgical approach for the SLNB. Surveillance over a period of 12 months did not reveal any signs of melanoma recurrence. A possible advantage of SPECT/CT is potentially decreasing costs by lowering operative time. However, financial cost in the literature suggests SPECT/CT is costlier than lymphoscintigraphy and therefore this must be weighed against any potential benefit. Overall, we did not find that SPECT/CT gives added value when compared with lymphoscintigraphy.

TI  - A user-generated data based approach to enhancing location prediction of financial services in sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent increase in user-generated content and social media adoption in developing countries offers an unprecedented opportunity to better understand the accessibility and spatial distribution of financial services in sub-Saharan Africa. Financial inclusion has been identified as a priority by multiple agencies in the region and on-the-ground efforts are currently underway to identify previously unknown financial access points in numerous developing African countries. Existing techniques for estimating the location of these access points rely on spatial analysis of often outdated or unsuitable publicly available datasets such as population density, road networks, etc., as well as expensive and time consuming surveys of locals in the region. In this work we propose an approach to augment existing spatial data analysis techniques through the inclusion of user-generated geo-content and geo-social media data. Through a comparison of standard regression models and machine learning techniques, this work proposes the use of alternative data sources to build prediction models for identifying financial access locations in countries where current estimation models are insufficient. With a better understanding of geospatial distribution patterns this work aims at reducing data acquisition costs and providing decision makers with critical data more quickly and efficiently. Finally, we present a mobile application built on the outcomes of this analysis that is currently being used to better inform on-the-ground data collection efforts.

TI  - Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy for people newly diagnosed with HIV infection in Australia: trends and predictors, 2004-2015
T2  - MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo determine trends in and predictors of early treatment for people newly diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Australia.Design, settingRetrospective cohort analysis of routinely collected longitudinal data from 44 sexual health clinics participating in the Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance (ACCESS) program.ParticipantsPatients diagnosed with HIV infections, January 2004 - June 2015.Main outcome measuresCommencement of antiretroviral therapy within 6 months of HIV diagnosis (early treatment); demographic, clinical, and risk group characteristics of patients associated with early treatment; trends in early treatment, by CD4(+) cell count at diagnosis.Results917 people were diagnosed with HIV infections, their median age was 34 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 27-43 years), and 841 (92%) were men; the median CD4(+) cell count at diagnosis was 510 cells/L (IQR, 350-674 cells/L). The proportion of patients who received early treatment increased from 17% (15 patients) in 2004-06 to 20% (34 patients) in 2007-09, 34% (95 patients) in 2010-12, and 53% (197 patients) in 2013-15 (trend, P<0.001). The probability of early treatment, which increased with time, was higher for patients with lower CD4(+) cell counts and higher viral loads at diagnosis.ConclusionsThe proportion of people newly diagnosed with HIV in sexual health clinics in Australia who received treatment within 6 months of diagnosis increased from 17% to 53% during 2004-2015, reflecting changes in the CD4(+) cell count threshold in treatment guidelines. Nevertheless, further strategies are needed to maximise the benefits of treatment to prevent viral transmission and morbidity.

TI  - Time and Tradition as Reflected in the <i>Etz Hayim</i> Torah Commentary
T2  - MODERN THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Conservative Movement in North America published a Torah commentary reflecting its historical and theological elucidation of Judaism. This commentary, Etz Hayim, evinces a number of features that the following essay subjects to critical comment and analysis. These include: the commentary's emphasis on historical context as critical to deciphering the Torah narratives and its laws; the presupposition that Judaism functions as an organism constantly in flux, open to patterns of progress and decline, with an aptitude for rebirth and self-renewal; and that the pivotal rubrics of belonging, believing, and behaving are quintessential features of Jewish identity. While these characteristics are relatively uncontroversial, the same cannot be said for the editorial decision to divide, on the same page, the commentary's 'historical' and 'homiletical' segments - a feature which effectively drives underground the option to integrate spiritual values and lessons using the tools of modern critical scholarship. Another unfortunate feature of Etz Hayim is that its two essays on Jewish law (Halakha) offer contrasting, competitive interpretations of how the halakhic process actually works in the minds of Conservative decisors. Yet these alternate approaches are not sufficiently delineated for the lay reader. Finally, while Etz Hayim does highlight value concepts that function as goads to ritual observance, the various contributors to the commentary and to the appended essays never fully engage why Conservative Jews ought to become serious practitioners of Jewish tradition. These shortcomings notwithstanding, Etz Hayim does offer a template of hope and expectation: through its historical-religious experiences, the Jewish people facilitates an ethical worldview of particular, and of universal, merit.

TI  - Adherence to treatment in allergic rhinitis using mobile technology. The MASK Study
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mobile technology may help to better understand the adherence to treatment. MASK-rhinitis (Mobile Airways Sentinel NetworK for allergic rhinitis) is a patient-centred ICT system. A mobile phone app (the Allergy Diary) central to MASK is available in 22 countries.Objectives: To assess the adherence to treatment in allergic rhinitis patients using the Allergy Diary App.Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was carried out on all users who filled in the Allergy Diary from 1 January 2016 to 1 August 2017. Secondary adherence was assessed by using the modified Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) and the Proportion of days covered (PDC) approach.Results: A total of 12143 users were registered. A total of 6949 users reported at least one VAS data recording. Among them, 1887 users reported >= 7 VAS data. About 1195 subjects were included in the analysis of adherence. One hundred and thirty-six (11.28%) users were adherent (MPR >= 70% and PDC <= 1.25), 51 (4.23%) were partly adherent (MPR >= 70% and PDC = 1.50) and 176 (14.60%) were switchers. On the other hand, 832 (69.05%) users were non-adherent to medications (MPR <70%). Of those, the largest group was non-adherent to medications and the time interval was increased in 442 (36.68%) users.Conclusion and clinical relevance: Adherence to treatment is low. The relative efficacy of continuous vs on-demand treatment for allergic rhinitis symptoms is still a matter of debate. This study shows an approach for measuring retrospective adherence based on a mobile app. This also represents a novel approach for analysing medication-taking behaviour in a real-world setting.

TI  - Modeling study on three-dimensional distribution of dust aerosols during a dust storm over the Tarim Basin, Northwest China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The air quality model WRF-Chem was employed to simulate a dust storm event in spring, 2015 over the Taldamakan Desert of the Tarim Basin (TB), Northwest China. Based on the reasonable evaluations with the ground observations and CALIPSO satellite data of meteorology and aerosols, the simulation was used to characterize the three-dimensional distribution of dust aerosols for this springtime dust storm over the TB. Under the impact of unique basin topography on a cold frontal system, a large amount of cold air invading the TB in three main tracks of near-surface winds: (1) westerly winds across the Pamirs Plateau, (2) northerly air flows crossing the Tianshan Mountains, and (3) strong northeast winds passing the northeast mouth of TB, building three main dust plumes over the TB for the dust storm process. The strong dust plume swept southwestwards across the basin with dominating over two weak dust plumes, and the mechanical effect of Tibetan Plateau on the dust plumes could determine the surface dust aerosol distribution over the TB. Based on observation and simulation, the extremely thick boundary layer was identified with the height of 3-5 km from the surface over the TB for the vertical distribution of dust aerosols. Dust aerosols were lifted up to 7 km in the free troposphere over the southern TB driven by the northern slope of the Tibetan Plateau. The distribution of dust aerosols in the upper boundary layer at the height of 3.5 km was controlled by the convergences of near-surface air flows over the TB and the obstruction of plateaus and mountains surrounding the TB, building the floating dust layer over the basin. This modeling study depicted the three-dimensional distribution of dust aerosols in a typical dust storm over the TB, Northwest China.

TI  - Assimilation of Earth Observation Data Over Cropland and Grassland Sites into a Simple GPP Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of detailed process-oriented simulation models for gross primary production (GPP) estimation is constrained by the scarcity of the data needed for their parametrization. In this manuscript, we present the development and test of the assimilation of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) observations into a simple process-based model driven by basic meteorological variables (i.e., global radiation, temperature, precipitation and reference evapotranspiration, all from global circulation models of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). The model is run at daily time-step using meteorological forcing and provides estimates of GPP and LAI, the latter used to simulate MODIS NDVI though the coupling with the radiative transfer model PROSAIL5B. Modelled GPP is compared with the remote sensing-driven MODIS GPP product (MOD17) and the quality of both estimates are assessed against GPP from European eddy covariance flux sites over crops and grasslands. Model performances in GPP estimation (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 2.45 gC m(-2) d(-1), MBE = -0.16 gC m(-2) d(-1)) were shown to outperform those of MOD17 for the investigated sites (R-2 = 0.53, RMSE = 3.15 gC m(-2) d(-1), MBE = -1.08 gC m(-2) d(-1)).

TI  - Comparison and evaluation of MODIS Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol product over South Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) is a new generic algorithm applied to collection 6 (C6) MODIS measurements to retrieve Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over land at high spatial resolution (1 km). This study is the first evaluation of the MAIAC AOD from MODIS Aqua (A) and Terra (T) satellites between 2006 and 2016 over South Asia. The retrieval accuracy of MAIAC was assessed by comparing it to ground-truth AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD, as well as to AOD retrieved by the two operational MODIS algorithms: Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB). MAIAC AOD showed higher spatial coverage and retrieval frequency than either the DT or the DB AOD retrievals. The high spatial resolution of the MAIAC retrievals enhances the capability to distinguish aerosol sources and to determine fine aerosol features, such as wildfire smoke plumes and haze over complex geographical regions, and provides more retrievals in conditions that are cloudy or when the surface is partially covered by snow. In comparison to AERONET AOD, MAIAC AOD shows a better accuracy than both DT and DB AOD. A higher number of MAIAC-AERONET AOD matchups demonstrate the capability of MAIAC to retrieve AOD over varied surfaces, different aerosol types and loadings. Our results demonstrate high retrieval accuracy in term of the Expected Error (EE) (A/T, EE: 72.22%, 73.50%), and low root mean square error (A/T, RMSE: 0.148, 0.164), root mean bias (RMB) (A/T, RMB: 0.978, 1.049) and mean absolute error (MAE) (A/T, MAE: 0.098, 0.096). Moreover, MAIAC has a lower bias as a function of the viewing geometry and the aerosol type among the three retrieval algorithms. MAIAC performed well over bright and vegetated land surfaces, showing the highest retrieval accuracy over dense vegetation and particularly well in retrieving smoke AOD, yet it underestimated dust AOD. In conclusion, MAIAC's ability to provide AOD at high spatial resolution appears promising over South Asia, thus having advantage over contemporary aerosol retrieval algorithms for epidemiological and climatological studies.Capsule: In comparison with MODIS DT and DB AOD, and AERONET AOD, MAIAC shows improved accuracy and lower bias over South Asia, as well as with greater spatial coverage.

TI  - Analysis of urban growth from 1960 to 2015 using historical DISP and Landsat time series data in Shanghai
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is one of the most important dimensions of contemporary global change. Urban growth affects life-supporting environment of human beings, as well as natural ecological system and biological composition. Thus, long time series urban land cover datasets with high spatial and temporal resolution are useful for understanding the dynamics of urban growth processes, providing great insights into urban planning and sustainable development in the future. For the first time, this study analyzes 55-year spatiotemporal patterns of urban changes in Shanghai, China, by integrating the historical Declassified Intelligence Satellite Photography (DISP) and Landsat time series data at 5-year intervals from 1960 to 2015. Here we applied different methods to detect urban land from DISP and Landsat images, respectively, and their accuracies were quantitatively analyzed and evaluated. The spatiotemporal patterns of urban growth were explored. The derived products showed that urban land cover increased at a rapid and accelerating pace with growth concentrated at the expanding fringes of existing urban clusters. Across the study region, the total urban area increased from 205.10 to 2259.97 km(2), at an average annual rate of 37.4 km(2)/year, and the percentage of urban area increased from 3.33 to 31.96%, expanded by more than 10 times between 1960 and 2015. In addition, urban area increased over time in all directions; the relative proportions of the urban area in downtown and non-downtown changed dramatically over the study period, indicating that urban sprawl of the metropolis experienced major transitions under the effect of population increase, economic development, and policies.

TI  - Integration of Satellite Images and Open Data for Impervious Surface Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supervised learning is vital to classify impervious surface from satellite images. Despite its effectiveness, the training samples need to be provided manually, which is time consuming and labor intensive, or even impractical when classifying satellite images at the regional/global scale. This study, therefore, sets out to automatically generate training samples from open data, based on the fact that cities and urban areas are nowadays full of individual geo-referenced data, such as social network data. The proposed method consists of automatic generation of training samples based on a filtering process of open data, satellite image preprocessing, and impervious surface detection using one class classification (OCC). Two Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager images were selected to test the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method is effective in impervious surface with good classification accuracy. The findings in this study shine new light on the applications of open data in remote sensing.

TI  - THE ASIAN CLAM <i>CORBICULA FLUMINEA</i> AS A POLLUTION SENTINEL SPECIES
T2  - JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The New River Basin (NRB) of Tennessee has many rare endemic aquatic communities. One such community is that of freshwater mussels, which are experiencing a precipitous population decline due to the fouling and pollution of their freshwater systems. Silos containing live individuals of the nonnative Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) were placed in several localities in streams of the NRB that receive mine drainage. This drainage is commonly associated with elevated conductivity typical of pollution that may impair native mussel health. This study of five impacted streams within the NRB, and a control stream of similar ecology, uses a stepwise multiple regression analysis to test this association. After accounting for factors such as temperature, results confirm that growth rates of these sentinel clams are significantly related to conductivity, and that these clams may be useful bioindicators of stream habitat quality for native mussels.

TI  - Assessment of factors driving high fire severity potential and classification in a Mediterranean pine ecosystem
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire severity is an increasingly critical issue for forest managers for estimating fire impacts. Estimating high fire severity potential and accurate classification between fire severity levels are essential for integrated fire management planning in fire prone Mediterranean pine ecosystems. This study attempts to determine the role of topography, pre-fire forest stand structure, fuel complex characteristics and fire behavior parameters on high fire severity potential and classification based on a large fire event occurred in Thasos, Greece. Within this framework, the Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm was used to model the relationship between a large set of predictors and fire severity as expressed by the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) spectral index, inferred from differenced pre- and post-fire Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) at 30-m resolution. Results from the RF classifier algorithm showed that high fire severity potential and classification between fire severity levels mainly depended on topography variables and fuel complex characteristics. Assessing of factors which drive a fire to turn into high severe fire and classification into fire severity levels will substantially help land and forest managers to increase fire prevention and develop of concrete actions for successful post fire management at landscape level.

TI  - Is systematic lymph node dissection mandatory or is sampling adequate in patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer?
T2  - INTERACTIVE CARDIOVASCULAR AND THORACIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - A best evidence topic in thoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was: Is systematic lymph node dissection (SLND) mandatory or is sampling adequate in stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)? Two hundred and eleven papers were identified, of which 12 papers represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and the results of these papers are tabulated. There are 7 retrospective cohort reviews, 3 meta-analyses and 2 randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) to answer the clinical question. Four of the 7 retrospective studies demonstrated that the total number of resected lymph nodes and the number of lymph node stations sampled affected the accuracy of staging in patients with early-stage NSCLC and had an impact on overall survival and disease-free survival. Two RCTs, 1 meta-analysis and 1 cohort study revealed no significant benefit in overall survival and disease-free survival in patients undergoing SLND. One meta-analysis, which contained only 1 RCT, revealed significantly better 3- and 5-year survival with SLND. One further meta-analysis revealed improved survival with SLND in cohort studies but no significant difference in the 4 RCTs included. Two further studies identified specific subgroups of patients in whom LN sampling could be justified and SLND avoided. We conclude that there is no significant difference in the recurrence rate when performing either SLND or LN sampling in patients with stage I NSCLC. While retrospective cohort studies implied survival benefit with SLND, this was not borne out in RCTs and meta-analyses. However, there may be a potential survival benefit for patients who are upstaged by SLND identifying mediastinal nodal involvement.

TI  - Sentinel-1 SAR Amplitude Imagery for Rapid Landslide Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite landslides impact the society worldwide every day, landslide information is inhomogeneous and lacking. When landslides occur in remote areas or where the availability of optical images is rare due to cloud persistence, they might remain unknown, or unnoticed for long time, preventing studies and hampering civil protection operations. The unprecedented availability of SAR C-band images provided by the Sentinel-1 constellation offers the opportunity to propose new solutions to detect landslides events. In this work, we perform a systematic assessment of Sentinel-1 SAR C-band images acquired before and after known events. We present the results of a pilot study on 32 worldwide cases of rapid landslides entailing different types, sizes, slope expositions, as well as pre-existing land cover, triggering factors and climatic regimes. Results show that in about eighty-four percent of the cases, changes caused by landslides on SAR amplitudes are unambiguous, whereas only in about thirteen percent of the cases there is no evidence. On the other hand, the signal does not allow for a systematic use to produce inventories because only in 8 cases, a delineation of the landslide borders (i.e., mapping) can be manually attempted. In a few cases, cascade multi-hazard (e.g., floods caused by landslides) and evidences of extreme triggering factors (e.g., strong earthquakes or very rapid snow melting) were detected. The method promises to increase the availability of information on landslides at different spatial and temporal scales with benefits for event magnitude assessment during weather-related emergencies, model tuning, and landslide forecast model validation, in particular when accurate mapping is not required.

TI  - Remote sensing vs. field survey data in a post-earthquake context: Potentialities and limits of damaged building assessment datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quick building damage assessment following disasters such as large earthquakes serves to establish a preliminary estimation of losses and casualties. These datasets are completed by employing several crowdsourcing initiatives, in which volunteers and collaborators map damaged buildings in a given area at a qualitative damage scale based on a post-earthquake aerial or satellite image. Automating this process is a temptation and a technical issue, but manual interpretation remains essential, with the identification of moderate and lateral damage being the key and limiting factor. Following the Haiti 2010 earthquake, many studies were completed by crossing multilayer data gathered from different sources (satellite, aerial, and field survey). These works created a building damage dataset that enabled the construction of different sets of empirical vulnerability functions. In the present study, we proposed to review the datasets used for the damage assessment again, investigate how they can be managed for understanding urban damage patterns, and quantify the potentialities and limits of the sets.A high-resolution map of damage in Port-au-Prince was used to obtain a deducted map of intensity and was then compared to more detailed post-earthquake investigations such as the microzonation of the city (Belvaux et al., 2018). These detailed post-earthquake investigations, in which array microtremor measurements are performed for characterization of the subsurface soil, contribute to a better understanding of local variations in intensity. Subsequently, a retro damage scenario was run, considering the different sets of vulnerability functions (using the RISK-UE methodology vulnerability indexes) fitted with empirical vulnerability functions. Using the characterization of the exposure on a remote sensing basis, the results fit the heaviest damage well (building collapse), but they overestimated moderate damage states compared to the observations. However, is an aerial image based dataset sufficiently exhaustive for moderate damage, which is mostly visible from a lateral or internal point of view? Finally, we suggested some range of adjustments that can be applied to a vulnerability assessment originating from remote sensing data such that it can be used more accurately in the detection of urban damage, even for moderate damage degrees.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background Epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem-like cells (CSC) have been linked to increased metastatic potential. We evaluated the prognostic impact of CD44, a CSC biomarker, on depth of invasion (DOI) and outcome in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).Methods Using a multivariable logistic regression model, we evaluated in early OSCCs the relationship between CD44 expression at the invasive tumor front, DOI, sentinel lymph node biopsy, extension of nodal involvement, and survival. We also assessed whether CT and/or MRI could predict DOI preoperatively.Results CD44 expression was associated with increased DOI (P = .018), worse disease-specific survival (P = .041) but not with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (P > .05). Each millimeter increase in DOI was associated with a 31.1% higher risk for positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (95% CI: 5.8%-62.4%, P = .013) and with higher metastatic ratio (P = .015). Preoperative estimation of DOI by CT and/or MRI and histopathological DOI showed a strong correlation (P < .0001).Conclusions CD44 expression correlates with DOI, which predicts occult lymph node metastasis. Preoperative CT and/or MRI provides an accurate estimation of histopathological DOI. Both pieces of information gained preoperatively can help surgeons tailor their operation in regard to the surgical management of the neck.

TI  - The first transcriptomic resource for the Antarctic scallop <i>Adamussium colbecki</i>
T2  - MARINE GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Adamussium colbecki is one of the most common bivalve mollusks found in the coastal waters of the Antarctic continent. Its widespread distribution, easiness of collection and sensitivity to slight alterations of water temperature and presence of pollutants make this cold-adapted scallop a potentially interesting sentinel species for the biomonitoring of the impact of anthropic activities on the Antarctic benthic communities. However, while the availability of genetic and molecular data would represent a resource of the utmost importance to enable the use of this species as a model for environmental studies, this data is presently nearly non-existing. Here we report a high quality de novo assembled and annotated transcriptome for A. colbecki, discussing the long-debated phylogenetic position of this species within the order Pectinida through a Bayesian phylogenomics approach, based on the concatenated multiple sequence alignment of 978 universally conserved orthologous genes.

TI  - The use of GIS, mapping, and immersive technologies in the CanMars Mars Sample Return analogue mission; advantages for science interpretation and operational decision-making
T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The CanMars Mars Sample Return (MSR) analogue mission was a high-fidelity rover campaign conducted over a total of five weeks in November 2015 and November 2016. The analogue mission team consisted of a Mission Control Team located at the University of Western Ontario (Western) in London, Ontario, Canada, and a Field Team including the Mars Exploration Science Rover (MESR) platform conducting in situ field operations in the desert north of Hanksville, Utah, USA. This location served as an analogue martian terrain for the duration of the CanMars mission campaign. The main science goal of the mission was to explore the field area using the MESR platform in order to locate and sample geologic materials best suited for identifying evidence for the existence of past or extant life. The CanMars analogue mission necessitated the organization and interpretation of several remote sensing datasets to provide regional morphological and compositional context for the lithological units observed by the rover in the operational field area. These tasks were given to the GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and Mapping team, a sub-team of the Mission Control Team located at Western. These remote sensing datasets were intended to be used as analogues for remote sensing data currently available for the Martian surface and included a HiRISE equivalent full colour Quickbird-2 satellite image (60 cm/pixel), a HiRISE/CTX approximating DEM (5 m/pixel horizontal resolution and a vertical accuracy on the order of 4 m or less), and CRISM and THEMIS equivalent visible to thermal infrared spectral images from Landsat-8 and ASTER (15-90 m/pixel). The GIS and Mapping Team used these datasets in concert with a range of additional derived data products (e.g., hillshade, slope, spectral and thermal inertia maps, etc.). This information was analyzed to create interpreted geomorphological maps of the operational field area. A major goal of the GIS and Mapping Team was to provide valuable contextual information to the Science and Planning Teams pertaining to the rover's position and the characteristics of the surrounding landscape and geology. The GIS and Mapping Team made use of geographic information systems including ArcMap and ArcScene to create a detailed database of geologic and geographic information as well as to derive additional geospatial data products. Additionally, the CanMars analogue missions provided an ideal setting to test the use of immersive virtual reality (VR) technology to aid scientists with both data and image interpretation as they conducted remote field operations. This included the development and implementation of immersive versions of the 360 panoramic images taken by the rover and an interactive immersive VR terrain model of the rover landing site and surrounding area. In the inherently time-sensitive role of interpreting data before sending the rover platform its next set of commands, the immersive technologies became important tools to facilitate a rapid understanding of the rover's location and orientation was well as the geologic and topographic setting of the surrounding region. These immersive products provided a first-person experience of the rover's surroundings that aided in the discussion and decision-making efforts of the CanMars team.

TI  - Long-term observation of cyanobacteria blooms using multi-source satellite images: a case study on a cloudy and rainy lake
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - High-frequency and reliable data on cyanobacteria blooming over a long time period is crucial to identify the outbreak mechanism of blooms and to forecast future trends. However, in cloudy and rainy areas, it is difficult to retrieve useful satellite images, especially in the rainy season. To address this problem, we used data from the HJ-1/CCD (Chinese environment and disaster monitoring and forecasting satellite/charge coupled device), GF-1/WFV (Chinese high-resolution satellite/wide field of view), and Landsat-8/OLI (Operational Land Imager) satellites to generate a time series of the bloom area from 2009 to 2016 in Dianchi Lake, China. We then correlated the responses of bloom dynamics to meteorological factors. Several findings can be drawn: (1) a higher bloom frequency and a larger bloom area occurred in 2011, 2013, and 2016, compared to the other years; (2) the frequency of blooms peaked in April, August, and November each year and expanded from north to south starting in July; (3) air temperature in spring and sunshine hours in summer greatly correlated to the yearly bloom area; (4) wind speed and sunshine hours strongly affected the short-term expansion of blooms and thereafter influenced the monthly bloom scale; and (5) rainfall had a strong short-term influence on the occurrence of blooms. Cyanobacteria blooms often occurred when wind speeds were less than 2.35 +/- 0.78 m/s in the dry season and 2.01 +/- 0.75 m/s in the rainy season, when there were 48 to 72 h of sunshine in the dry season and 35 to 57 h of sunshine in the rainy season, and when there was more than 10 mm of daily precipitation.

TI  - Phenology-adjusted dynamic curve number for improved hydrologic modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN, or CN) is a widely used method to estimate runoff from rainfall events, It has been adapted to many parts of the world with different land uses, land cover types, and climatic conditions and successfully applied to situations ranging from simple runoff calculations and land use change assessment to comprehensive hydrologic/water quality simulations. However, the CN method lacks the ability to incorporate seasonal variations in vegetated surface conditions, and unnoticed landuse/landcover (LULC) change that shape infiltration and storm runoff. Plant phonology is a main determinant of changes in hydrologic processes and water balances across seasons through its influence on surface roughness and eva-potranspiration. This study used regression analysis to develop a dynamic CN (CNNDVI) based on seasonal variations in the remotely-sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to monitor intra-annual plant phonological development. A time series of 16-day MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1 Collection 5) images were used to monitor vegetation development and provide NDVI data necessary for CNNDVI model calibration and validation. Twelve years of rainfall and runoff data (2001-2012) from four small watersheds located in the Konza Prairie Biological Station, Kansas were used to develop, calibrate, and validate the method. Results showed CNNDVI performed significantly better in predicting runoff with calibrated CN(NDVI )runoff increasing by approximately 0.74 for every unit increase in observed runoff compared to 0.46 for SCS-CN runoff and was more highly correlated to observed runoff (r = 0.78 vs. r = 0.38). In addition, CN(NDVI )runoff had better NSE (0.53) and PBLAS (4.22) compared to the SCS-CN runoff ( - 0.87 and -94.86 respectively). In the validated model, CN(NDVI )runoff increased by approximately 0.96 for every unit of observed runoff, while SCS-CN runoff increased by 0.49. Validated runoff was also better correlated to observed runoff than SCS-CN runoff (r = 0.52 vs. r = 0.33). These findings suggest that the CN(NDVI )can yield improved estimates of surface runoff from precipitation events, leading to more informed water and land management decisions.

TI  - Synchronous Breast Implant-associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma and Invasive Carcinoma: Genomic Profiling and Management Implications
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - A 59-year-old woman with a history of cosmetic implants developed ipsilateral synchronous breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) and invasive ductal carcinoma in the left breast. Each tumor was subjected to next-generation sequencing, and separate analyses revealed mutually exclusive aberrations: an activating STAT3 mutation in the lymphoma and a PIK3CA in-frame deletion in the carcinoma. The patient was treated with removal of implants, capsulectomy, partial mastectomy, sentinel node biopsy, radiotherapy, and endocrine therapy with no evidence of recurrence for 1 year. This case illustrates the importance of obtaining thorough evaluation for concomitant malignancies in the breast at the time of diagnosis of BIA-ALCL. Herein, we review the current recommendations for evaluation and management of BIA-ALCL.

TI  - Review of axillary web syndrome: What the radiologist should know
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Axillary web syndrome is common after axillary surgery, frequently affecting breast cancer patients. In this condition, patients develop one or more linear bands of firm tissue, also known as "cords", in the axilla and arm, associated with pain and limited range of motion of the shoulder and arm. Radiologists may encounter this syndrome in patients referred for axillary or upper extremity ultrasound, and should be aware of the physical examination and ultrasound findings for accurate diagnosis. However, there are currently limited articles about this syndrome published in radiology journals, suggesting that radiologists may be unaware of this entity. In this work, axillary web syndrome will be discussed, including background knowledge, incidence, clinical presentation, possible etiology, and ultrasound appearance.

TI  - Train distance and speed estimation using multi sensor data fusion
T2  - IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate distance and speed estimates of train and individual coaches are necessary for the safe operation of the high-speed train system. Often, the train system does not rely on a single sensor for its distance and speed measurements as the sensors are susceptible to diverse operating conditions such as snow, rain, fog, tunnel, hilly region, slip, slide, etc. Hence, the information from a combination of sensors which can complement each other under certain operating conditions is required for the correct estimation. For distance measurements, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and balise are generally used. For speed sensing, the combination of wheel sensor, radar and GNSS are chosen. The diversity of sensors in terms of sampling rate and noise characteristics, etc. greatly affect the overall estimation accuracy and reliability if the measurements are used directly. Hence, this work presents a probabilistic weighted fusion algorithm which is based on the nonlinear longitudinal train dynamic model. The fusion algorithm combines the state estimates from distributed and sensor-specific extended Kalman filters. The effectiveness of the proposed fusion algorithm is demonstrated on the simulated sensor measurements along with a wide range of noises, spurious measurements, train operating conditions and track environmental disturbances.

TI  - Relationships between NDVI and climatic factors in mountain ecosystems: A case study of Armenia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we study vegetation, temperature, and precipitation dynamics, as well as their correlations and lagtime effects in mountain ecosystems of Armenia using SPOT/VGT NDVI data over the period 1998-2013. Three study sites near the Sisian, Megri and Kajaran meteorological stations were chosen, representing steep, xerophytic and meadow vegetation types, respectively. The results showed a significant increase in NDVI across the growing season during the study period. Meanwhile, a significant increase in mean precipitation and temperature during the growing season was detected for the Kajaran station. A negative correlation was observed between temperature and xerophytic/steep vegetation NDVI and positive correlation between temperature and meadow vegetation NDVI, while correlations between precipitation and NDVI for all vegetation types were positive. Moreover, the response of vegetation to climatic factors exhibited a time-lag effect. In general, the temperature and precipitation in the 2nd and 3rd 10-day intervals of April have a strong impact on the vegetation growth in summer. This study suggests that for a better understanding of the impact and lag-time effect of climatic factors on mountain vegetation growth it is preferable to use 10-day data.

TI  - Multiple lymphatic-venous anastomoses in reducing the risk of lymphedema in melanoma patients undergoing complete lymph node dissection. A retrospective case-control study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an indispensable surgical procedure in staging and management of intermediate-to-thick melanomas. Although recent studies have demonstrated that complete lymph node dissection (CLND) does not improve 3-year specific survival, its utility in increasing the disease-free period and the control of local disease remains confirmed. The most frequent complication related to CLND is lymphedema, which may affect up to 20% of patients undergoing CLND. The preventive use of lymphatic-venous micro-anastomoses could avoid this complication.Materials and methods: We performed a single-institution retrospective case-control study. CLND was proposed to all subjects with positive-SLNB; a preventive procedure involving multiple lymphaticovenular anastomoses (PMA) was performed in a cohort of subjects undergoing CLND. Frequency of lymphedema was compared among subjects undergoing and not-undergoing PMA during CLND.Results: We selected patients affected by melanoma of the trunk and with a minimum follow-up of 3 years, identifying 23 patients who underwent PMA during CLND (PMA group) and 120 subjects who underwent CLND without PMA (control group). The frequency of lymphedema was significantly lower in the PMA group than in the control group (4.3% vs. 24.2%, p= 0.03). Patients of the PMA group and the control group showed similar 3-year recurrence-free period (65.2% vs. 62.5%, log-rank test p =0.88) and 3-year overall survival (73.9% vs. 72.5%, log-rank test p = 0.97) and frequency of nonsentinel-node metastases (26.7% vs. 30.4%, p= 0.71).Conclusion: PMA appear to represent a useful and safe procedure in reducing the risk of lymphedema in patients with melanoma undergoing CLND.

TI  - Improvement in Quality of Care for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes in Hungary Between 2008 and 2016: Results from Two Population-Based Representative Surveys
T2  - DIABETES THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionDue to the increasing trends of recent decades, diabetes prevalence has reached a frequency of 1/11 adults worldwide. However, this disadvantageous trend has not been accompanied by worsened outcome indicators; better short-term (e.g., HbA1c levels) and long-term [e.g., all-cause mortality among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients] outcomes can be observed globally. We aimed to describe changes in the effectiveness of type 2 diabetes mellitus care between 2008 and 2016 based on outcome indicators.MethodsThe study is a secondary analysis of data from two previously performed surveys. Both surveys were conducted in the framework of the General Practitioners' Morbidity Sentinel Stations Program (GPMSSP), which maintains a nationally representative registry of T2DM patients.ResultsThe largest improvement was observed in achieving fasting blood glucose and HbA1c target values [OR=0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.56-0.80 and OR=0.58; 95% CI, 0.48-0.70, respectively]. Moderate improvement was detected by reaching body mass index (BMI), diastolic blood pressure and total cholesterol target values (OR=0.78, 95% CI, 0.65-0.93; OR=0.78, 95% CI, 0.65-0.94 and OR=0.76, 95% CI, 0.63-0.92, respectively).ConclusionOur study demonstrated that if standardized indicators are investigated in population-based samples, the effectiveness of T2DM care can be monitored by ad hoc surveys. The systematic application of this approach completed with the detailed documentation of the applied therapies could demonstrate the public health impact of certain modifications in T2DM care. An overall improvement in metabolic control (glycaemic control, lipid status and obesity) was observed, which was not accompanied by improved therapeutic target achievement for systolic blood pressure.

TI  - Detection of microbleeds associated with sentinel headache using MRI quantitative susceptibility mapping: pilot study
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE Sentinel headaches (SHs) associated with cerebral aneurysms (CAs) could be due to microbleeds, which are considered a sign that an aneurysm is unstable. Despite the prognostic importance of these microbleeds, they remain difficult to detect using routine imaging studies. The objective of this pilot study is to detect microbleeds associated with SH using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) sequence and then evaluate the morphological characteristics of unstable aneurysms with microbleeds.METHODS Twenty CAs in 16 consecutive patients with an initial presentation of headache (HA) leading to a diagnosis of CA were analyzed. Headaches in 4 of the patients (two of whom had 2 aneurysms each) met the typical definition of SH, and the other 12 patients (two of whom also had 2 aneurysms each) all had migraine HA. All patients underwent imaging with the MRI-QSM sequence. Two independent MRI experts who were blinded to the patients' clinical history performed 3D graphical analysis to evaluate for potential microbleeds associated with these CAs. Computational flow and morphometric analyses were also performed to estimate wall shear and morphological variables.RESULTS In the 4 patients with SH, MRI-QSM results were positive for 4 aneurysms, and hence these aneurysms were considered positive for non-heme ferric iron (microbleeds). The other 16 aneurysms were negative. Among aneurysm shape indices, the undulation index was significantly higher in the QSM-positive group than in the QSM-negative group. In addition, the spatial averaged wall shear magnitude was lower in the aneurysm wall in direct contact with microbleeds.CONCLUSIONS MRI-QSM allows for objective detection of microbleeds associated with SH and therefore identification of unstable CAs. CAs with slightly greater undulation indices are associated with positive MRI-QSM results and hence with microbleeds. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.

TI  - The water resources of tropical West Africa: problems, progress, and prospects
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Review
AB  - West Africa plays key roles in global climate and shows one of the strongest variations in hydro-climatic conditions. As it turns out, the region appears to be underrepresented in the existing compendium of Earth science and hydrology-focused journal papers when it comes to significant discussion on terrestrial hydrology and freshwater science. This prominent gap is largely precipitated by increasing number of constraints that include lack of considerable and robust investments in gauge measurements for meteorological and hydrological applications, poor funding of research institutions and other disincentives, among other factors. In this manuscript, the challenges and problems in large-scale terrestrial hydrology-focused investigation in West Africa are reviewed. Using a dossier of some recent contributions in the field of remote sensing hydrology, this review also highlights some of the progress in terrestrial hydrology and the opportunities that exist for hydro-geodetic research in West Africa that leverage on sustained investments in satellite geodetic missions. It is noted that West Africa is still a pristine environment for hydrology-focused research and can benefit from recent advancements in sophisticated space agency programs such as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, which undoubtedly has revolutionized terrestrial hydrology research around the world for nearly two decades. Given the poor density of gauge stations and limited ground observations, hydrological research in West Africa is expected to benefit more from independent space observations and multi-resolution data. This is because the lack of sufficient in-situ data for the parameterizations and adequate initialization of outputs from hydrological models and reanalysis data for hydrological applications results in poor representation of the West African land surface and hydrological state variables. To further improve our contemporary understanding of West Africa's terrestrial hydrology, the continued evaluation/validation of these observations and space-borne measurements is advocated.

T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - In July 2017, fever and sepsis developed in 3 recipients of solid organs (1 heart and 2 kidneys) from a common donor in the United States; 1 of the kidney recipients died. Tularemia was suspected only after blood cultures from the surviving kidney recipient grew Francisella species. The organ donor, a middle-aged man from the southwestern United States, had been hospitalized for acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. F tularensis subsp. tularensis (clade A2) was cultured from archived spleen tissue from the donor and blood from both kidney recipients. Whole-genome multilocus sequence typing indicated that the isolated strains were indistinguishable. The heart recipient remained seronegative with negative blood cultures but had been receiving antimicrobial drugs for a medical device infection before transplant. Two lagomorph carcasses collected near the donor's residence were positive by PCR for F tularensis subsp. tularensis (clade A2). This investigation documents F tularensis transmission by solid organ transplantation.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) became established during the last decade as an emerging technology with considerable potentialities and applicability. Its paradigm of everything connected together penetrated the real world, with smart devices located in several daily appliances. Such intelligent objects are able to communicate autonomously through already existing network infrastructures, thus generating a more concrete integration between real world and computer-based systems. On the downside, the great benefit carried by the IoT paradigm in our life brings simultaneously severe security issues, since the information exchanged among the objects frequently remains unprotected from malicious attackers. The paper at hand proposes COSMOS (Collaborative, Seamless and Adaptive Sentinel for the Internet of Things), a novel sentinel to protect smart environments from cyber threats. Our sentinel shields the IoT devices using multiple defensive rings, resulting in a more accurate and robust protection. Additionally, we discuss the current deployment of the sentinel on a commodity device (i.e., Raspberry Pi). Exhaustive experiments are conducted on the sentinel, demonstrating that it performs meticulously even in heavily stressing conditions. Each defensive layer is tested, reaching a remarkable performance, thus proving the applicability of COSMOS in a distributed and dynamic scenario such as IoT. With the aim of easing the enjoyment of the proposed sentinel, we further developed a friendly and ease-to-use COSMOS App, so that end-users can manage sentinel(s) directly using their own devices (e.g., smartphone).

TI  - Detection of Vegetation Cover Change in Renewable Energy Development Zones of Southern California Using MODIS NDVI Time Series Analysis, 2000 to 2018
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - New solar energy facilities on public lands in the deserts of southern California are being monitored long-term to detect environmental impacts. For this purpose, we have developed a framework for detecting changes in vegetation cover region-wide using greenness index data sets from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor. This study focused on three sites, Joshua Tree National Park (JOTR), Mojave National Preserve (MOJA), and a proximal group of solar energy Development Focus Areas (DFAs). Three MODIS vegetation indices (VIs), the normalized difference (NDVI), enhanced (EVI), and soil-adjusted (SAVI), all at 250-m spatial resolution, were evaluated using the Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) methodology to estimate significant time series shifts (breakpoints) in green vegetation cover, from February 2000 to May 2018. The sample cross-correlation function with local precipitation records and comparison with timing of wildfires near the study sites for breakpoint density (proportion of area with a breakpoint) showed that NDVI had the strongest response and hence greatest sensitivity to these major disturbances compared to EVI and SAVI, supporting its use over the other VIs for subsequent analysis. Time series of NDVI breakpoint change densities for individual solar energy DFAs did not have a consistent vegetation response following construction. Bootstrap-derived 95% confidence intervals show that the DFAs have significantly larger kurtosis and standard deviation in positive NDVI breakpoint distribution than protected National Park System (NPS) sites, but no significant difference appeared in the negative distribution among all sites. The inconsistent postconstruction NDVI signal and the large number of detected breakpoints across all three sites suggested that the largest shifts in greenness are tied to seasonal and total annual precipitation amounts. Further results indicated that existing site-specific conditions are the main control on vegetation response, mostly driven by the history of human disturbances in DFAs. Although the results do not support persistent breakpoints in solar energy DFAs, future work should seek to establish links between statistical significance and physical significance through ground-based studies to provide a more robust interpretation.

TI  - An automatic water detection approach using Landsat 8 OLI and Google Earth Engine cloud computing to map lakes and reservoirs in New Zealand
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water surface dynamics is essential for the management of lakes and reservoirs, especially those are intensively impacted by human exploitation and climatic variation. Although modern satellites have provided a superior solution over traditional methods in monitoring water surfaces, manually downloading and processing imagery associated with large study areas or long-time scales are time-consuming. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform provides a promising solution for this type of big data problems when it is combined with the automatic water extraction index (AWEI) to delineate multi-temporal water pixels from other forms of land use/land cover. The aim of this study is to assess the performance of a completely automatic water extraction framework by combining AWEI, GEE, and Landsat 8 OLI data over the period 2014-2018 in the case study of New Zealand. The overall accuracy (OA) of 0.85 proved the good performance of this combination. Therefore, the framework developed in this research can be used for lake and reservoir monitoring and assessment in the future. We also found that despite the temporal variability of climate duringthe period 2014-2018, the spatial areas of most of the lakes (3840) in the country remained the same at around 3742 km(2). Image fusion or aerial photos can be employed to check the areal variation of the lakes at a finer scale.

TI  - Modified earlobe reconstruction technique following wide local excision of melanoma that facilitates sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The earlobe represents an important element in the aesthetic appearance of the entire ear. Reconstruction of the earlobe is challenging. The authors present a reconstructive option following wide excision of melanoma of the earlobe that facilitates sentinel lymph node biopsy from the neck without further incision. We report satisfactory results obtained using this technique for immediate earlobe reconstruction. We present two cases of malignant melanoma of the earlobe. Both cases were treated with a 1-cm wide local excision of melanoma scar of the ear lobe and reconstruction with double opposing local transposition flaps and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) of the neck via the skin flap incisions without further need for incision extension. This is a technique for earlobe reconstruction that provides satisfactory results that can be performed in a single stage procedure simultaneously allowing access for sentinel lymph node biopsy from the cervical, pre- and post-auricular lymph node basins. We feel this technique is an option to be considered when treating melanoma of the earlobe requiring SLNB.Level of Evidence: Level V, therapeutic study.

TI  - Spatiotemporal distribution of aerosols over the Indian subcontinent and its dependence on prevailing meteorological conditions
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The prevailing meteorological conditions that influence the advection and diffusion of the atmosphere govern the distribution of atmospheric particles from its sources. The present study explores the spatiotemporal distribution of atmospheric aerosols over the Indian subcontinent (5 degrees-40 degrees N, 65 degrees-100 degrees E) and its dependence on the prevailing meteorological conditions. Eleven years (2002-2012) of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) along with meteorological parameters extracted from reanalysis data are analysed at monthly timescales. Wind speed, wind divergence and planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) are studied as parameters for advection and diffusion of atmospheric aerosols. The result shows higher aerosol loading during the monsoon season with increased spatial variability. Wind speed and divergence correlate with AOD values both over land (R = 0.75) and ocean (R = 0.82) with increased aerosol loading at higher wind speeds, which are converging in nature. Owing to the varied climatology of the Indian subcontinent, land and ocean areas were classified into subregions. Analysis was carried out over these subregions to infer the influence of meteorological conditions on aerosol loading. Results are indicative of a distinct characteristic in the prevailing meteorological conditions that influence the distribution of certain aerosol types. Further, the PBLH was analysed as an indicator of atmospheric diffusion to infer its importance in aerosol distribution. The results indicate that PBLH explains almost 30 to 90% of the total variance in AOD over the subregions which is particularly evident during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability in Remotely Sensed Vegetation Greenness Across Yellowstone National Park
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study's objective was to quantify the responses of vegetation greenness and productivity to climate variability and change across complex topographic, climatic, and ecological gradients in Yellowstone National Park through the use of remotely sensed data. The climate change signal in Yellowstone was pronounced, including substantial warming, an abrupt decline in snowpack, and more frequent droughts. While phenological studies are increasing in Yellowstone, the near absence of long-term and continuous ground-based phenological measurements motivated the study's application of remotely sensed data to aid in identifying ecological vulnerabilities and guide resource management in light of on ongoing environmental change. Correlation, time-series, and empirical orthogonal function analyses for 1982-2015 focused on Daymet data and vegetation indices (VIs) from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The study's key questions address unique time scales. First, what are the dominant meteorological drivers of variability in vegetation greenness on seasonal to interannual time scales? Key results include: (1) Green-up is the most elevation- and climate-sensitive phenological stage, with La Nina-induced cool, wet conditions or an anomalously deep snowpack delaying the green-up wave. (2) Drought measures were the dominant contributors towards phenological variability, as winter-spring drought corresponded to enhanced April-June greening and spring-summer drought corresponded to reduced August-September greening. Second, how have patterns of productivity changed in response to climate change and disturbances? Key results include: (1) The park predominantly exhibited positive productivity trends, associated with lodgepole pine re-establishment and growth following the 1988 fires. (2) Landscapes which were undisturbed by the 1988 fires showed no apparent sign of warming-induced greening. This study motivates a systematic investigation of remote-sensing data across western parks to identify ecological vulnerabilities and support the development of climate change vulnerability assessments and adaptation strategies.

TI  - Resolving biogeochemical processes in lakes using remote sensing
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing helps foster our understanding of inland water processes allowing a synoptic view of water quality parameters. In the context of global monitoring of inland waters, we demonstrate the benefit of combining in-situ water analysis, hydrodynamic modelling and remote sensing for investigating biogeochemical processes. This methodology has the potential to be used at global scales. We take the example of four Landsat-8 scenes acquired by the OLI sensor and MODIS-Aqua imagery over Lake Geneva (FranceSwitzerland) from spring to early summer 2014. Remotely sensed data suggest a strong temporal and spatial variability during this period. We show that combining the complementary spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions of these sensors allows for a comprehensive characterization of estuarine, littoral and pelagic near-surface features. Moreover, by combining in-situ measurements, biogeochemical analysis and hydrodynamic modelling with remote sensing data, we can link these features to river intrusion and calcite precipitation processes, which regularly occur in late spring or early summer. In this context, we propose a procedure that can be used to monitor whiting events in temperate lakes worldwide.

TI  - Delineation of Cocoa Agroforests Using Multiseason Sentinel-1 SAR Images: A Low Grey Level Range Reduces Uncertainties in GLCM Texture-Based Mapping
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Delineating the cropping area of cocoa agroforests is a major challenge in quantifying the contribution of land use expansion to tropical deforestation. Discriminating cocoa agroforests from tropical transition forests using multispectral optical images is difficult due to the similarity of the spectral characteristics of their canopies. Moreover, the frequent cloud cover in the tropics greatly impedes optical sensors. This study evaluated the potential of multiseason Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to discriminate cocoa agroforests from transition forests in a heterogeneous landscape in central Cameroon. We used an ensemble classifier, Random Forest (RF), to average the SAR image texture features of a grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) across seasons. We then compared the classification performance with results from RapidEye optical data. Moreover, we assessed the performance of GLCM texture feature extraction at four different grey levels of quantization: 32 bits, 8 bits, 6 bits, and 4 bits. The classification's overall accuracy (OA) from texture-based maps outperformed that from an optical image. The highest OA (88.8%) was recorded at the 6 bits grey level. This quantization level, in comparison to the initial 32 bits in the SAR images, reduced the class prediction error by 2.9%. The texture-based classification achieved an acceptable accuracy and revealed that cocoa agroforests have considerably fragmented the remnant transition forest patches. The Shannon entropy (H) or uncertainty provided a reliable validation of the class predictions and enabled inferences about discriminating inherently heterogeneous vegetation categories.

TI  - Warming trends in Patagonian subantartic forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The forests in the Aysen region (ca. 43-49 degrees S, Chile) have a high degree of wilderness and cover more than 4.8 million hectares, making it one of the largest areas of subantarctic forest in the Southern Hemisphere. The impact of global warming on this region is poorly documented. The main objective of this work was to analyze the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST) and precipitation over Aysen forests in the context of ongoing global warming. We used average monthly images of LST and NDVI derived from the MODIS sensor covering the period 2001-2016 and precipitation from gridded datasets. The Aysen region was divided into three nested spatial scales: i) regional, ii) regional considering only forests, iii) local scale considering an evergreen subantarctic forest area covering around 5 x 5 km and a local deciduous forest area (dominated by Nothofagus pumilio). Trend analysis showed a warming rate of +0.78 K/decade (p <= 0.05) over the subantarctic forest zone, greening of +0.01/decade for NDVI (p <= 0.05) over the western zone, and a drying trend (p <= 0.05) over the eastern zone. The minimum temperature anomalies showed an increase of about 4.5 K during the period under analysis. LST, NDVI and precipitation were also analyzed here. The recent trends in temperature, greening and precipitation over the forests of Aysen detected in this research contribute to a better understanding of global warming impacts on subantarctic forests in the southern tip of South America. Nevertheless, to get a better estimation of the impact of global warming at multiple scales is needed to have better quality and quantity of data in situ.

TI  - Fluorescence Guidance in Surgical Oncology: Challenges, Opportunities, and Translation
T2  - MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Surgical resection continues to function as the primary treatment option for most solid tumors. However, the detection of cancerous tissue remains predominantly subjective and reliant on the expertise of the surgeon. Surgery that is guided by fluorescence imaging has shown clinical relevance as a new approach to detecting the primary tumor, tumor margins, and metastatic lymph nodes. It is a technique to reduce recurrence and increase the possibility of a curative resection. While significant progress has been made in developing this emerging technology as a tool to assist the surgeon, further improvements are still necessary. Refining imaging agents and tumor targeting strategies to be a precise and reliable surgical strategy is essential in order to translate this technology into patient care settings. This review seeks to provide a comprehensive update on the most recent progress of fluorescence-guided surgery and its translation into the clinic. By highlighting the current status and recent developments of fluorescence image-guided surgery in the field of surgical oncology, we aim to offer insight into the challenges and opportunities that require further investigation.

TI  - <i>TERT</i> Promoter Mutations are Associated with Visceral Spreading in Melanoma of the Trunk
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Survival predictions are currently determined on the basis of NRAS/BRAF mutations, even though TERT promoter mutations have been recently associated with a poor prognosis in stage I-II melanomas. Usually, it is not recommended to perform a mutational test on primary melanoma, as the results do not always reflect the mutational status of metastases. In particular, trunk melanomas have been reported to have an unfavourable prognosis. A series of 105 advanced melanoma patients were analysed by TERT promoter Sanger sequencing. Univariate/multivariate binary logistic regression models were performed using progression to a visceral site as the dependent variable and patient/tumour characteristics as covariates. Performance of the model was assessed in an external independent primary melanoma patients' dataset. Male gender (odds ratio (OR), 344; 95% CI, 1.12-10.6; p = 0.031), AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) classification (OR, 022; 95% CI, 0.07-0.67; p = 0.008), SLNB (Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy) status (OR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.06-8.78; p = 0.039) and TERT-mutated trunk lesions (OR, 3.78; 95% CI, 1.35-10.6; p = 0.011) were significantly associated with the risk of developing a visceral spreading as first site of progression using multivariate logistic regression analysis. These results were confirmed in the external validation control group. Therefore, in trunk primary melanomas, due to their high risk of progression to visceral sites, we encourage somatic TERT mutation analysis at diagnosis to identify those patients who would potentially benefit from a more intensive follow-up protocol and a prompt initiation of therapy.

TI  - An Analysis of the Early Regeneration of Mangrove Forests using Landsat Time Series in the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of satellite sensor data have been used to quantify mangrove cover changes at regional and global levels. Although mangrove forests have been monitored using remote sensing techniques, the use of time series to quantify the regeneration of these forests still remains limited. In this study, we focus on the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) located in Peninsular Malaysia, which has been under silvicultural management since 1902 and provided the opportunity to investigate the use of Landsat annual time series (1988-2015) for (i) detecting clear-felling events that take place in the reserve as part of the local management, and (ii) tracing back and quantifying the early regeneration of mangrove forest patches after clear-felling. Clear-felling events were detected for each year using the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) derived from single date (cloud-free) or multi-date composites of Landsat sensor data. From this series, we found that the average period for the NDMI to recover to values observed prior to the clear-felling event between 1988 and 2015 was 5.9 +/- 2.7 years. The maps created in this study can be used to guide the replantation strategies, the clear-felling planning, and the management and monitoring activities of the MMFR.

TI  - Improving Aboveground Biomass Estimation of Pinus densata Forests in Yunnan Using Landsat 8 Imagery by Incorporating Age Dummy Variable and Method Comparison
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing data have been widely used for estimating forest aboveground biomass (AGB). However, the use of optical images is often restricted by the saturation of spectral reflectance for forests that have multilayered and complex canopy structures and high AGB values and by the effect of spectral reflectance from underlayer shrub, grass, and bare soil for young stands. This usually leads to overestimations and underestimations for smaller and larger values, respectively, and makes it very challenging to improve the estimation accuracy of forest AGB. In this study, a novel methodology was proposed by incorporating stand age as a dummy variable into four models to improve the estimation accuracy of the Pinus densata forest AGB in Yunnan of Southwestern China. A total of eight models, including two parametric models (LM: linear regression model and LMC: LM with combined variables), two nonparametric models (RF: random forest and ANN: artificial neural network) without the age dummy variable, and four corresponding models with the age dummy variable (DLM, DLMC, DRF, and DANN), were compared to estimate AGB. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images and 147 sample plots were acquired and utilized. The results showed that (1) compared with the two parametric models, the two nonparametric algorithms resulted in significantly greater estimation accuracies of Pinus densata forest AGB, and the increases of accuracy varied from 8% to 32% for 100 modeling plots and from 12% to 35% for 47 test plots based on root mean square error (RMSE); (2) compared with the models without the age dummy variable, the models with the age dummy variable greatly reduced the overestimations for the plots with AGB values smaller than 70 Mg/ha and the underestimations for the plots with AGB values larger than 180 Mg/ha and, thus, significantly improved the overall estimation accuracy by 14% to 42% for the modeling plots and by 32% to 44% for the test plots based on RMSE; and (3) the texture measures derived from the Landsat 8 OLI images contributed more to improving the estimation accuracy than the original spectral bands and other transformations. This implied that two nonparametric models, coupled with the use of the age dummy variable and texture measures, offered a great potential for improving the estimation accuracy of Pinus densata forest AGB.

TI  - Use of Landsat-8 OLI data for delineating fracture systems in subsoil regions: implications for groundwater prospection in the Waddai area, eastern Chad
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite images for mapping and analyzing linear structures and fracture systems in subsoil regions is essential to understand the subsurface groundwater path ways and traps. In this study, we apply Optimal Index Factor (OIF), principal component analysis (PCA), and directional filtering (Sobel) of several Landsat 8bands for the wooded Waddai area in NE Chad. The application of the Sobel directional filter to thesebands showed a robust performance for enhancing the discontinuity features and allowed better identification of the fault/fracture systems by theautomated lineament extraction techniques. The results indicate that the ENE and WSW structural trends control the distribution and migration of groundwater, in good agreement with previous hydrological studies and published hydrogeological maps. New highly potential areas for groundwater exploration are identified on a lineament density map and verified by ground truth urban distribution.

TI  - Use of remote sensing and GIS techniques for groundwater exploration in the basement complex terrain of Ado-Ekiti, SW Nigeria
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated investigations involving remote sensing and GIS have been conducted with the objective of achieving optimal results in sustainable groundwater development in Ado-Ekiti, south-western Nigeria. The hard rock terrain in the region presents challenges in groundwater exploration. Landsat imageries were used for landuse/landcover mapping and lineament analysis for groundwater prospecting. Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission Digital Elevation Model was used for drainage network extraction, slope and geomorphological analysis. Thematic maps were generated, analysed in terms of hydrogeological importance and reclassified for integration using appropriate software. The groundwater potential maps generated were validated against the existing groundwater yield data. The light vegetation and bare soil area cover was 110.9km(2), with the rock outcrops covering a total area of 14.9km(2). Hydrogeomorphic units delineated included hills, pediments, pediplains, alluvium and valley fills. The lineaments showed predominantly NNW-SSE, ENE-WSW and NNE-SSW orientations and subsidiary NW-SE and W-E trends. Application of geospatial techniques has been recognized. The methodology provides improvements in the understanding of the hydrogeological characteristics of the basement terrain. These will aid planning and management of groundwater resources in the crystalline basement terrain.

M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous malignant melanoma is potentially an important health problem for white people. The incidence of melanoma is rising faster than other solid cancers. Despite the new melanoma drugs surgery for localised melanoma and regional metastasis is still the standard of care. However management of cutaneous melanoma differs from other cancers at some points such as biopsy technique, surgical margine, incorporation of sentinel lymph node biopsy for staging etc. In this review we focused on the role of the head and neck surgeon in management of cutaneous melanoma of head and neck region according to current knowledge.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval by Integrating TASI-600 Airborne Thermal Data, WorldView 2 Satellite Data and Field Measurements: Petacciato Case Study
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays a fundamental role in the terrestrial water cycle and in agriculture, with key applications such as the monitoring of crop growing and hydrogeological management. In this study, a calibration procedure was applied to estimate SM based on the integration of in situ and airborne thermal remote sensing data. To this aim, on April 2018, two airborne campaigns were carried out with the TASI-600 multispectral thermal sensor on the Petacciato (Molise, Italy) area. Simultaneously, soil samples were collected in different agricultural fields of the study area to determine their moisture content and the granulometric composition. A WorldView 2 high-resolution visible-near infrared (VNIR) multispectral satellite image was acquired to calculate the albedo of the study area to be used together with the TASI images for the estimation of the apparent thermal inertia (ATI). Results show a good correlation (R-2 = 0.62) between the estimated ATI and the SM of the soil samples measured in the laboratory. The proposed methodology has allowed us to obtain a SM map for bare and scarcely vegetated soils in a wide agricultural area in Italy which concerns cyclical hydrogeological instability phenomena.

TI  - Characterizing urban redevelopment process by quantifying thermal dynamic and landscape analysis
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban redevelopment practices have received substantial attention in urban planning. Remotely sensed thermal infrared monitoring of urban heat island (UHI) is a well-documented topic, however, there is a lack of understanding of the influence on UHI change caused by urban redevelopment process. The objectives of this study was to investigate the urban redevelopment-induced efforts incorporating remote sensing of UHI and land use change. Multi-temporal ASTER thermal infrared images were employed to characterize UHI change; and high resolution Worldview images were employed to perform land use classification. UHI dynamic was quantified with urban heat island ratio index. Analysis of urban redevelopment-induced land use change with response to UHI were carried out. Landscape ecology methods were employed to quantitatively identify land use change with landscape metrics. Result demonstrated that UHI effect had a trend of mitigation during urban redevelopment process in the study area. Urban heat island intensity could be significantly eliminated or weakened by changes of land use composition and spatial configuration. These phenomena were closely related to redevelopment practices such as industrial relocation, buildings demolition, and brownfield transformation. This article presented a case study for characterizing urban redevelopment process with remote sensing monitoring, quantifying the change with urban heat island ratio index and landscape ecology analysis, research findings could be utilized as indicators for urban planning.

TI  - SLN mapping in early-stage cervical cancer as a minimal-invasive triaging tool for multimodal treatment
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To evaluate sensitivity, false negative rate and negative predictive value of the combination of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and frozen section (FS) in triaging cervical cancer patients to a definitive chemo-radiotherapy.Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with histologically proven cervical cancer undergoing laparoscopic SLN mapping and frozen section of the SLNs followed by a completion radical hysterectomy, pelvic and/or paraarotic lymphadenectomy. Sensitivity, false negative rate and negative predictive value of the SIN mapping, of the frozen section and of the combination of the two in identifying micro- and macrometastases were calculated.Results: One-hundred and four patients with cervical cancer underwent surgery. Of these, 87 (83.7%) had bilateral detection rates at the SLN mapping and underwent FS evaluation and were selected for statistical analysis. Twenty-five patients had lymph nodal metastases at H&E staining. Of these, 24 displayed metastatic disease to the SLNs and one to a NSLN accounting for a FN rate of 4.0%. Metastases were identified in 21 patients at the FS analysis. Four patients had metastases in the SLNs that were missed at the FS analysis. The FN rate of the FS is 12.5% if we excluded isolated tumour cells in the analysis. The FN rate of the combined methodology (SLN mapping and FS of the SLN) is 16%. Twenty-one out of 25 patients (84.0%) could correctly be triaged to a definitive chemo-radiotherapy.Conclusions: The combination of SLN mapping and FS of the SLNs is efficient in triaging patients to a definitive chemo-radiotherapy.

TI  - Prediction of Severe Drought Area Based on Random Forest: Using Satellite Image and Topography Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The uncertainty of drought forecasting based on past meteorological data is increasing because of climate change. However, agricultural droughts, associated with food resources and determined by soil moisture, must be predicted several months ahead for timely resource allocation. Accordingly, we designed a severe drought area prediction (SDAP) model for short-term drought without meteorological data. The predictions of our proposed SDAP model indicate a forecast of serious drought areas assuming non-rainfall, not a probability prediction of drought occurrence. Furthermore, this prediction provides more practical information to help with rapid water allocation during a real drought. The model structure using remote sensing data consists of two parts. First, the drought function f(x) from the training area by random forest (RF) learned the changes in the pattern of soil moisture index (SMI) from the past drought and the training performance was found to be root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.052, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.039, R-2 = 0.91. Second, derived f(x) predicted the SMI of the study area, which is 20 times larger than the training area, of the same season of another year as RMSE = 0.382, MAE = 0.375, R-2 = 0.58. We also obtained the variable importance stemming from RF and discussed its meaning along with the advantages and limitations of the model, training areas selection, and prediction coverage.

TI  - Satellite-based Forest Withering Index for Detection of Fire Burn Area: Its Development and Application to 2019 Kangwon Wildfires
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter describes a development of satellite-based forest withering index for detection of fire burn area and its application to the Goseong-Sokcho and Gangneung-Donghae wildfires in April 4, 2019. Withered forest has very different spectral characteristics from healthy forest. In particular, a false color composite of R-NIR-G represents such difference very clearly. Using Sentinel-2 images with the forest withering index, we derived the area burned by the wildfires: approximately 701.16 ha for Goseong-Sokcho and approximately 710.60 ha for Gangneung-Donghae, although official record will be announced by the Korean government later.

TI  - Baekdu Volcano Lake "Chun-ji" Ice Dynamic Monitoring Using TerraSAR-X Satellite Imagery
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The caldera lake "Chun-ji" is located at the summit of Baekdu volcano, which is in the border of China and North Korea. Chun-ji Lake has altitude 2,189 m above sea level. The Chun-ji is freezing in the winter when the water temperature goes down to zero for a year, and it melts in the season when the water temperature goes up again. However, since it is located at a high altitude, there are many cloudy days, and it is difficult to observe with optical images. For this reason, radar images, which are less influenced by weather than optical images, are more effective for observing the ice of heaven and earth. In this study, 75 TerraSAR-X images from chun-ji area were used for analysis from 2015 to 2017, and the calculated ice area and temperature changes were analyzed. As a result, the ice of the caldera lake formed was formed in early December and slowly melted until mid-April. During this period, temperatures in the Samjiyeon area were about -10 degrees C when ice was produced, and the temperature was about 0 degrees C in mid-April when it was thawing. Correlation coefficients between ice surface area and temperature in winter 2015 and 2016, where global ice is produced, show a high correlation of -0.82 and -0.75. In addition to the results of this study, it can be used as an indicator to monitor the volcanic activity by comparing the result of the recent volcanic activity with the result of the increase in water temperature using various imagery.

TI  - Ethanol standard in halal dietary product among Southeast Asian halal governing bodies
T2  - TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The term halal has been associated with Islam in various areas including services, foods, and product. One of the main focus of halal research is halal certification and standard. The certification process involves verification of halal authenticity of the foods and adherence to Islamic principles. Despite the growing issuance of halal accreditation and efforts in uniting of halal certification, there are significant differences in determining the standard of halal accreditation and halal food regulation particularly between Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and Malaysia, regardless of being neighbouring nations. Such instance is the variability of standards in determining the content of ethanol in the foods products. Thus, this review endeavours to study the standards in determining the permissible content of ethanol products and to investigate the reasons behind the contradiction in halal food regulation.Scope and approach: The review is conducted through the literature regarding the dissimilarities of ethanol permissibility in halal dietary standard between the four countries, and at the same time, in-depth interviews with the corresponding from halal authorities in each country were also carried out.Key findings and conclusions: Findings from the analysis suggest that authorities in those four countries differ their judgement based on these four factors; the material of preference for ethanol content; the technique of preference in ethanol detection laboratory; the undetermined constant in Blood Alcoholic Concentration calculation; and Islamic worldview on the usage of Alcohol. This review will be able to provide clarification and future references in constructing universal halal standard of ethanol content in the dietary product.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Distribution of Mercury in Gulls Eggs from the Iberian Peninsula
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined how coastal mercury contamination varied spatially and temporally across the Iberian Peninsula by measuring mercury concentrations in the eggs of the sentinel biomonitor yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis). Samples were collected from eight colonies that ranged from the Atlantic across the south and northern areas of the Mediterranean. We also measured Hg residues in eggs of the one of the most endangered gull species in the world, the Audouin's gull (Larus audouinii) from the Ebro Delta, where colonies of yellow-legged and Audouin's gull co-occur. Fresh eggs were collected in 2009 and 2016 and samples were pooled from each colony for analysis. Mercury concentrations in yellow-legged gulls ranged between 0.4 and 2.8mg/kg dry weight (dw); although there were no significant differences in concentrations between sampling periods, significant differences were found between colonies. Higher concentrations were associated with northern Mediterranean colonies (Columbretes and Ebro Delta), likely due to proximity to emission sources, circulatory marine currents and diet composition. Mercury concentrations in yellow-legged gull eggs were lower than those reported to result in impaired hatching. Residues in Audouin's gull eggs from the Ebro Delta were significantly higher (4.0-5.6mg/kgdw) than those in yellow-legged gull from the same location, probably associated with dietary differences. Mercury levels in Audouin's gull were ten times above the benchmark suggested to reduce nest success by 10%. Overall, these results raise concern for adverse health impacts in this protected seabird species and further investigation in Audouin's gull eggs from the Ebro Delta is recommended.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The work aims to identify the ice-marginal depositional landforms and the geomorphological processes in proglacial environments of the Ecology, Sphinx, Baranowski, Tower and Windy glaciers (east-flowing land-terminating glaciers of the Warszawa Ice cap), Admiralty Bay coast, King George Island, South Shetlands, Maritime Antarctica (62 degrees 12'0 '' S - 58 degrees 30'0 '' W). Geomorphometrical analysis were carried out using a 8 meters TanDEM-X Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and it was evidenced a predominance of elevation classes between 100-200 m. The Tower and Sphinx proglacial areas has highest slope values. The geomorphological mapping of glacial, glaciofluvial and glaciolacustre landforms of ice-free land areas was obtained with visual analysis of Sentinel-2 (2018) and WorldView-2 (2014) images. A dynamic proglacial environment is derived of the glacial retreat processes, and reveals different landforms, such as lateral, recession frontal, lateral-frontal moraines, eskers, lakes, lagoons and drainage channels. The recent ice-free land areas are susceptible to paraglacial (non-glacial) processes. The proglacial environment presented a complete paraglacial transition, leaving several environments (I-III: more to less glacial action) with distances from the glacier margins. The Tower and Sphinx glaciers have the smallest area in I environment due their steeper profile. The mapped features resulted in the glacial reconstruction and the discontinuity of the outermost lateral-frontal moraine evidenced marine termination conditions for all the glaciers.

TI  - Errors in Time-Series Remote Sensing and an Open Access Application for Detecting and Visualizing Spatial Data Outliers Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed measures of productivity are frequently used to characterize global agriculture and vegetated ecosystems, and are often downscaled to describe local, remote areas where finer spatial and temporal resolution data are regularly unavailable. While data errors may propagate throughout any analytical procedure, those that are missed during delivery and preliminary data mining require more attention. Here, a collection of formerly and presently available global remote sensing products are compiled to demonstrate the temporal and geographic breadth of remote sensing uncertainty. Vegetation productivity measures are invaluable for monitoring global health, but erroneous estimates that go unrecognized may result in serious policy mistakes. It is eminently clear that generalizable and accessible a priori methods for anomaly detection are lacking and urgently needed so that data errors are recognized before public delivery and before widespread use. Simple yet effective statistics such as the modified Z-score, Tukey's outliers, and Geary's C are leveraged here to identify, locate, and visualize the types of outliers that remote sensing data users may elect to omit or correct. Contributing to the growing ensemble of Google Earth Engine methodologies, we propose this generalizable method of detecting spatial outliers for remote sensing error management by users across scientific domains.

TI  - Prognostic impact of repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR) has an unfavourable prognosis, with a significant subsequent risk of distant recurrence. Repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy (rSLNB) has recently been demonstrated to be technically feasible and useful in tailoring adjuvant treatment plans in patients with IBTR. The prognostic impact of rSLNB in patients with IBTR remains unclear. This study analysed the risk of distant recurrence after IBTR, and evaluated the prognostic impact of rSLNB and other patient and tumour characteristics on distant recurrence-free survival.Methods: Data were obtained from the SNARB (Sentinel Node and Recurrent Breast Cancer) study. Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed to assess the prognostic effect of tumour, patient and treatment factors on distant recurrence-free survival.Results: Of the 515 included patients, 230 (44.7 per cent) had a tumour-negative rSLNB and 46 (8.9 per cent) a tumour-positive rSLNB. In 239 patients (46.4 per cent) the rSLNB procedure was unsuccessful. After a median follow-up of 5.1 years, 115 patients (22.3 per cent) had developed a recurrence. The overall 5-year distant recurrence-free survival rate was 84.2 (95 per cent c.i. 80.7 to 87.7) per cent. An interval of less than 2 years between primary breast cancer treatment and ipsilateral recurrence (P = 0.018), triple-negative IBTR (P = 0.045) and absence of adjuvant chemotherapy after IBTR (P = 0.010) were independently associated with poor distant recurrence-free survival. The association between the outcome of rSLNB and distant recurrence-free survival was not statistically significant (P = 0.682).Conclusion: The outcome of rSLNB is not an important prognostic factor for distant recurrence, and its value as a staging tool in patients with IBTR seems disputable.

TI  - Mapping Plantations in Myanmar by Fusing Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 Data along with Systematic Error Quantification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests in Southeast Asia are experiencing some of the highest rates of deforestation and degradation in the world, with natural forest species being replaced by cropland and plantation monoculture. In this work, we have developed an innovative method to accurately map rubber and palm oil plantations using fusion of Landsat-8, Sentinel 1 and 2. We applied cloud and shadow masking, bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), atmospheric and topographic corrections to the optical imagery and a speckle filter and harmonics for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. In this workflow, we created yearly composites for all sensors and combined the data into a single composite. A series of covariates were calculated from optical bands and sampled using reference data of the land cover classes including surface water, forest, urban and built-up, cropland, rubber, palm oil and mangrove. This training dataset was used to create biophysical probability layers (primitives) for each class. These primitives were then used to create land cover and probability maps in a decision tree logic and Monte-Carlo simulations. Validation showed good overall accuracy (84%) for the years 2017 and 2018. Filtering for validation points with high error estimates improved the accuracy up to 91%. We demonstrated and concluded that error quantification is an essential step in land cover classification and land cover change detection. Our overall analysis supports and presents a path for improving present assessments for sustainable supply chain analyses and associated recommendations.

TI  - Laboratory investigations of the physical state of CO<sub>2</sub> ice in a simulated Martian environment
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - We have experimentally investigated CO2 ice condensation under conditions similar to those expected in the Martian polar areas using the Environmental Wind Tunnel of Aarhus University in the framework of Trans-National Access opportunities within the EuroPlanet Research Infrastructure. Our goal was to condense CO2 directly from the chamber's atmosphere onto a specially designed cooling plate. We investigated ranges of temperatures and pressures similar to those in Martian polar areas, observed the texture of the created CO2 ice layer, and measured its optical properties. Most importantly, we find that under conditions usual for Martian polar areas in fall and winter, CO2 ice always deposits as a translucent slab. The maximum thickness of the ice that we have achieved approached 2 cm and this CO2 slab ice layer was either transparent or highly translucent. Under significantly lower temperatures or in states away from equilibrium (for example, when CO2 gas input into the chamber was fast and created over-pressure) CO2 deposited as different crystalline structures. In this case, when a thick layer was created, it was not visually transparent. However, even in those cases it still retains some level of translucency. Our results will advance the analysis of remote-sensing data related to CO2 ice, Mars' seasonal cycles, and various models considering CO2 ice condensation-sublimation related processes.

TI  - Changes in Vegetation Cover of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Estimated from MODIS Greenness Trends, 2000-18
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Trends and transitions in the growing-season normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor at 250-m resolution were analyzed for the period from 2000 to 2018 to understand recent patterns of vegetation change in ecosystems of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. Statistical analysis of changes in the NDVI time series was conducted using the breaks for additive seasonal and trend method (BFAST). This structural change analysis indicated that NDVI breakpoints and negative 18-yr trends in vegetation greenness over the years since 2000 could be explained in large part by the impacts of severe wildfires. At least one NDVI breakpoint was detected in around 20% of the MODIS pixels within both the Porcupine River and Coleen River basins of the study area. The vast majority of vegetation cover in the ANWR Brooks Range and coastal plain ecoregions was detected with no (positive or negative) growing-season NDVI trends since the year 2000. Results suggested that most negative NDVI anomalies in the 18-yr MODIS record have been associated with early spring thawing and elevated levels of surface moisture in low-elevation drainages of the northern ANWR ecoregions.

TI  - Tropical Cyclone Heat Potential and the Rapid Intensification of Hurricane Harvey in the Texas Bight
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Harvey entered the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression on 23 August 2017; two days later it had strengthened to a category 1 hurricane. Over the following 30hr Harvey rapidly intensified, reaching the Texas Bight as a category 3 storm. This intensification continued while Harvey crossed the shelf, making landfall as a category 4 storm 60km east of Corpus Christi, TX on 26 August. A hydrographic survey two weeks prior to landfall shows that the tropical cyclone heat potential across the Texas Bight was approximately 35kJ/cm(2), which is 55kJ/cm(2) less than the amount of upper ocean heat normally associated with intensification. Combined with buoy, float, and satellite data, we use hydrographic surveys to study the conditions of the Texas Bight that contributed to Harvey's rapid intensification. We find that, at the time of landfall, the Texas Bight was well mixed with very warm water extending from the surface to bottom. As a consequence, mixing induced by Harvey had a small impact on surface temperatures which remained high and supported continued intensification. The results show that tropical cyclone heat potential is not an effective metric for hurricane intensity prediction in shallow water, and illustrate the need for continuous subsurface monitoring in order to improve hurricane forecasts.Plain Language Summary Hurricanes rely on heat extracted from the upper ocean as their energy source. When the ocean is warm conditions are more favorable and hurricanes are often stronger. Hurricanes also mix the ocean which brings cold water from greater depth and can lead to intensity reduction. Tropical cyclone heat potential is a measure of heat in the upper ocean which is available as an energy source for hurricanes. In shallow water tropical cyclone heat potential is typically low because there is not as much water to store heat; therefore, hurricanes are not expected to intensify over shallow water. In this paper we show that hurricane Harvey did intensify over the shallow water off the Texas coast despite having low heat potential. Using ocean measurements, we found that the reason was because the ocean was very warm from the surface to the seabed. Therefore, when Harvey mixed the ocean very little cold water was brought up from below and the surface remained warm which allowed Harvey to continue to strengthen. Results suggest that tropical cyclone heat potential is ineffective for estimating hurricane strength in shallow water and demonstrates the importance of knowing subsurface temperatures if we want to improve hurricane forecasts.

TI  - Assessment of Convolution Neural Networks for Wetland Mapping with Landsat in the Central Canadian Boreal Forest Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods for effective wetland monitoring are needed to understand how ecosystem services may be altered from past and present anthropogenic activities and recent climate change. The large extent of wetlands in many regions suggests remote sensing as an effective means for monitoring. Remote sensing approaches have shown good performance in local extent studies, but larger regional efforts have generally produced low accuracies for detailed classes. In this research we evaluate the potential of deep-learning Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) for wetland classification using Landsat data to bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and water classes defined by the Canada Wetland Classification System (CWCS). The study area is the northern part of the forested region of Alberta where we had access to two reference data sources. We evaluated ResNet CNNs and developed a Multi-Size/Scale ResNet Ensemble (MSRE) approach that exhibited the best performance. For assessment, a spatial extension strategy was employed that separated regions for training and testing. Results were consistent between the two reference sources. The best overall accuracy for the CWCS classes was 62-68%. Compared to a pixel-based random forest implementation this was 5-7% higher depending on the accuracy measure considered. For a parameter-optimized spatial-based implementation this was 2-4% higher. For a reduced set of classes to water, wetland, and upland, overall accuracy was in the range of 86-87%. Assessment for sampling over the entire region instead of spatial extension improved the mean class accuracies (F1-score) by 9% for the CWCS classes and for the reduced three-class level by 6%. The overall accuracies were 69% and 90% for the CWCS and reduced classes respectively with region sampling. Results in this study show that detailed classification of wetland types with Landsat remains challenging, particularly for small wetlands. In addition, further investigation of deep-learning methods are needed to identify CNN configurations and sampling methods better suited to moderate spatial resolution imagery across a range of environments.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hailstorms cause enormous physical damage in agriculture, often result in disasters leading to widespread, sudden loss in harvestable produce, and at times entire loss to grownup orchards. Accurate area-wide crop damage assessment is a challenging task to provide timely relief to farmers. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using multispectral satellite data for mapping crop-damaged area, identification of hailstreaks, their ground track attributes using NDVI difference of pre and post-hailstorm events. Crop classification within hailstreak was performed using a multispectral, high resolution LISS-IV satellite data from IRS-Resourcesat-2. Six hailstorm-damaged streaks were examined in the study area, varying in width ranging from 3 to 8 km, and length ranging from 6 to 33 km. Maximum area damaged was in grapes, followed by sugarcane and papaya. Changes in NDVI profile of different crops in the study area was recorded, and a model was developed for estimating changes in NDVI due to hail damage. The crop classification error matrix indicated Kappa Coefficient (0.55) with an overall classification accuracy of 69.6%. This study discusses the potential of high spectral, spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data for crop damage assessment in the aftermath of the hailstorms.

TI  - Estimation of Significant Wave Height of Near-Range Traveling Ocean Waves Using Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a valuable tool to observe many oceanographic parameters of the ocean surface. The significant wave height (H-s or SWH), defined as the mean wave height of the highest one-third of waves, can be estimated using indirect relations between SAR-derived and the actual ocean wave spectra. However, multilook SAR imaging of ocean surface waves is highly affected by degraded azimuthal resolution and the random shift of scattered elements as the waves propagate off the SAR range direction. Therefore, the azimuthal displacement is found to be very low when near-range travelling ocean waves with narrow band spectrum are imaged. In this study, an improved algorithm is developed to directly estimate the significant wave height of ocean waves that propagate in the near-range direction using SARSAR imagery. The slope of the NRCS with respect to the radar wave incidence angle is derived from SAR images using an iterative scheme. A total of 69 SAR images from Sentinel-1A and 1B from 2016 to 2017, acquired near Hawaii, and in situ wave data from nearby National Data Buoy Center buoys are used to estimate H-s and validate the improved algorithm. Results show that the algorithm performs well in estimating SWH under low to moderate wind forcing conditions (4-10 ms(-1)). The accuracy of the SWH estimation decreases under high-wind-speed and wind-wave-dominant conditions.

TI  - Passive Earth Observations of Volcanic Clouds in the Atmosphere
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Current Earth Observation (EO) satellites provide excellent spatial, temporal and spectral coverage for passive measurements of atmospheric volcanic emissions. Of particular value for ash detection and quantification are the geostationary satellites that now carry multispectral imagers. These instruments have multiple spectral channels spanning the visible to infrared (IR) wavelengths and provide 1 x 1 km(2) to 4 x 4 km(2) resolution data every 5-15 min, continuously. For ash detection, two channels situated near 11 and 12 m are needed; for ash quantification a third or fourth channel also in the infrared is useful for constraining the height of the ash cloud. This work describes passive EO infrared measurements and techniques to determine volcanic cloud properties and includes examples using current methods with an emphasis on the main difficulties and ways to overcome them. A challenging aspect of using satellite data is to design algorithms that make use of the spectral, temporal (especially for geostationary sensors) and spatial information. The hyperspectral sensor AIRS is used to identify specific molecules from their spectral signatures (e.g., for SO2) and retrievals are demonstrated as global, regional and hemispheric maps of AIRS column SO2. This kind of information is not available on all sensors, but by combining temporal, spatial and broadband multi-spectral information from polar and geo sensors (e.g., MODIS and SEVIRI) useful insights can be made. For example, repeat coverage of a particular area using geostationary data can reveal temporal behaviour of broadband channels indicative of eruptive activity. In many instances, identifying the nature of a pixel (clear, cloud, ash etc.) is the major challenge. Sophisticated cloud detection schemes have been developed that utilise statistical measures, physical models and temporal variation to classify pixels. The state of the art on cloud detection is good, but improvements are always needed. An IR-based multispectral cloud identification scheme is described and some examples shown. The scheme is physically based but has deficiencies that can be improved during the daytime by including information from the visible channels. Physical retrieval schemes applied to ash detected pixels suffer from a lack of knowledge of some basic microphysical and optical parameters needed to run the retrieval models. In particular, there is a lack of accurate spectral refractive index information for ash particles. The size distribution of fine ash (1-63 <>m, diameter) is poorly constrained and more measurements are needed, particularly for ash that is airborne. Height measurements are also lacking and a satellite-based stereoscopic height retrieval is used to illustrate the value of this information for aviation. The importance of water in volcanic clouds is discussed here and the separation of ice-rich and ash-rich portions of volcanic clouds is analysed for the first time. More work is required in trying to identify ice-coated ash particles, and it is suggested that a class of ice-rich volcanic cloud be recognized and termed a volcanic ice' cloud. Such clouds are frequently observed in tropical eruptions of great vertical extent (e.g., 8 km or higher) and are often not identified correctly by traditional IR methods (e.g., reverse absorption). Finally, the global, hemispheric and regional sampling of EO satellites is demonstrated for a few eruptions where the ash and SOispersed over large distances (1000s km).

T2  - MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mutis Timau Forest Complex (MTFC), a remained mountainous tropical forest area in Timor Island, located in Indonesia and Timor-Le.sle border region, tends to decrease gradually. Unfortunately, declined forest area and their rates are not explained by reliable spatial and quantitative information. This study attempts to assess the extent and rate of forest cover changes in the MTFC during the last 30 years. We used Landsat images on three different dates: 1987, 1999, and 2017. Then, we applied a hybrid classification approach that combines the application of Forest Canopy Density model-obtained from four biophysical indices and supervised classification-maximum likelihood classification to generate land cover maps. Finally, we detected forest cover change by comparing land cover map in different years. Results illustrated that the extent and annual rate of deforestation, forest degradation, forest regrowth, and afforestation during 1987-2017 were 2,232 ha (0.36%), 4,820 ha (1.10%), 1,475 ha (0.69%), and 1,252 ha (0.40%), respectively. Such results are important for the MTFC authority to establish appropriate plan and strategies in forest management activities and can he used to support some policies/programs for combating deforestation and forest degradation.

TI  - Monitoring the effects of extreme drought events on forest health by Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change is expected to result in more frequent and intense drought events, especially during the warm season. In such perspective, it is crucial to assess the forest stands vulnerability to extreme climatic events, such as drought, even for Mediterranean forest tree species, commonly considered resistant to dry spell. To test the capability of multitemporal imagery derived by Sentinel-2 (S2) in detecting the impacts of extreme drought events on forest health assessed as crown dieback, some forest stands in Tuscany (central Italy) were analyzed. Vegetation indices (VIs) and ancillary digital terrain model-derived data have been collected in 118 observational samples distributed along an ecological gradient. VIs detected a reduction of trees of photosynthetic activity in August 2017. S2 data have allowed the observation of the different response strategies of the tree species considered in this study to the extreme climatic event that occurred. The case study presented shows that S2 can be applied for monitoring climate-related processes providing a synthetic overview of forest conditions at regional scale.

TI  - Towards a Tool for Early Detection and Estimation of Forest Cuttings by Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing the extent and frequency of forest cuttings over large areas is crucial for forest inventories and monitoring. Remote sensing has amply proved its ability to detect land cover changes, particularly in forested areas. Among various strategies, those focusing on mapping using classification approaches of remotely sensed time series are the most frequently used. The main limit of such approaches stems from the difficulty in perfectly and unambiguously classifying each pixel, especially over wide areas. The same procedure is of course simpler if performed over a single pixel. An automated method for identifying forest cuttings over a predefined network of sampling points (IUTI) using multitemporal Sentinel 2 imagery is described. The method employs normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) growth trajectories to identify the presence of disturbances caused by forest cuttings using a large set of points (i.e., 1580 forest points). We applied the method using a total of 51 S2 images extracted from the Google Earth Engine over two years (2016 and 2017) in an area of about 70 km(2) in Tuscany, central Italy.

TI  - Revealing patterns of greenspace in urban areas resulting from three urban growth types
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have revealed the processes of urban expansion in numerous cities around the world based on three urban growth types: outlying, edge-expansion, and infilling. However, few studies have explored the landscape patterns inside newly developed urban areas that are defined based on the three growth types. In this paper, we used Landsat images to investigate the urban growth of Shenzhen from 1979 to 2017. In addition, we used high-resolution images to compare the pattern of greenspace in areas that developed from outlying, edge expansion, and infilling. Our results showed that Shenzhen experienced two expansion phases, which is in accordance with the diffusion-coalescence hypothesis. In addition, we found that the greenspace patterns in edge expansion and outlying patches were similar, but were different from those of infilling. In the infilling patches, the greenspace percentage, edge density (ED) and largest patch index (LPI) were significantly larger than those in the patches of the other two expansion types. This study linked landscape patterns and urban growth types that enhanced our understanding of the process of urban expansion and may provide valuable information for local policy making and urban planning.

TI  - An irregularly shaped warm eddy observed by Chinese underwater gliders
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale eddies are important for transporting oceanic energy and matter. We investigated the three-dimensional structure of an irregularly shaped warm eddy using three Chinese underwater gliders and satellite data during May 2015 in the northern South China Sea. The warm eddy lasted for 2 months, remained quasi-steady, and had a mean radius of similar to 70 km from May 10 to May 31. The heat contents observed along the two glider tracks differed markedly, by 2 x 10(9) J/m(2), which reflected an imbalance in the geostrophic and tangential velocity distributions of the eddy. The geostrophic/tangential velocity decreased/increased with depth within the warm eddy. The maximum tangential velocities calculated using the datasets from the two gliders were 0.8 and 0.25 m/s, respectively, confirming that the shape of the warm eddy was horizontally asymmetrical. Large errors can arise when the heat, energy, and matter transport for an irregularly shaped eddy are estimated using a regular circular model. We suggest that more intersecting glider tracks should be used to retrieve the three-dimensional eddy structure, and that those tracks should be better designed. The irregular shape of the warm eddy was likely induced by oceanic currents such as the wind-induced Ekman current. Further study is needed to elucidate the eddy-current interactions and the mechanisms thereof.

TI  - Activating Structural Alterations in MAPK Genes Are Distinct Genetic Drivers in a Unique Subgroup Of Spitzoid Neoplasms
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have described kinase fusions as the most common initiating genomic events in Spitzoid neoplasms. Each rearrangement generates a chimeric protein with constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase domain, resulting in the development of a Spitzoid neoplasm. Identifying key initiating genomic events and drivers may assist in diagnosis, prognostication, and management. Retrospective, consecutive search of our database between 2009 and 2018 for Spitzoid neoplasms identified 86 cases. Whole transcriptome mRNA and DNA sequencing (1714 genes) detected 9% of cases (8/86) with structural rearrangements in MAPK genes other than BRAF and 47% (40/86) with kinase fusions previously described in Spitzoid neoplasms. We identified in-frame fusions of MAP3K8-DIPC2, MAP3K8-PCDH7, MAP3K8-UBL3, MAP3K8-SVIL (n=6), and ATP2A2-MAP3K3 (n=1) as well as a p.I103_K104 in-frame deletion of MAP2K1 (n=1), in the absence of well-recognized drivers of melanocytic neoplasia. Fluorescence in situ hybridization validated all cases (n=7) with available tissue. Cases occurred in younger patients (median age 18 y). Morphologically, cases were predominantly epithelioid (P=0.0032), often with some melanin pigment (P=0.0047), and high-grade nuclear atypia (P=0.012). A significant proportion were thought to be Spitzoid melanomas (3/8). Average follow-up time was 11 months. One MAP3K8-DIP2C Spitzoid melanoma involved 4/5 sentinel lymph nodes and led to a complete lymph node dissection with unremarkable follow-up at 9 months. One MAP3K8-DIPC2 atypical Spitz tumor raised concern for recurrence at 10 months and was reexcised. We present a distinct subtype of Spitzoid neoplasm characterized by structural alterations in MAPK genes, which are important to recognize given the potential for treatment with MAPK inhibitors in metastatic cases.

TI  - Medical Options for the Adjuvant Treatment and Management of Pediatric Melanoma
T2  - PEDIATRIC DRUGS
M3  - Review
AB  - Although melanoma is a rare diagnosis in the pediatric population, advances in the management of adults with melanoma offer the prospect of promising therapeutic options for children. At this time, medical management is not considered curative but may reduce the risk of recurrence or prolong survival. Surgical management remains the mainstay of treatment. Medical therapy of pediatric melanoma is not thought to have a role for in situ, early-stage, or localized disease, but adjuvant therapy may have a role in improving the prognosis of patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), spread beyond the regional lymph node basin, metastatic disease, or recurrent disease. Medical treatment options include immunotherapies, particularly checkpoint inhibitors, and targeted therapies, which have provided improved toxicity profiles compared with traditional chemotherapy regimens in the setting of advanced disease. There is a growing body of pediatric-specific data relevant to the use of adjuvant therapies for advanced melanoma in children.

TI  - Spatial analysis of landslide susceptibility using failure rate approach in the Hindu Kush region, Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses and applies a spatio-statistical failure rate (SSFR) technique for landslide susceptibility zonation in the Hindu Kush region, Pakistan. The study area (Shahpur valley) is located in the eastern Hindu Kush mountain system. In Shahpur valley, land sliding is a recurrent and costly extreme event. Geologically, this region constitutes the youngest mountain systems and almost every year landslide-induced losses are reported. The frequency and intensity of landslide events is expected to further increase in future due to rapid population growth over the fragile slopes, infrastructural development and deforestation. In order to achieve objectives of the study, data were obtained from both primary and secondary sources. In Shahpur valley, an inventory of the past 300 landslide events of various sizes has been identified and marked on a SPOT satellite image of 2.5m resolution. In order to identify the influence of landslide triggering factors, such as geology, tectonic structures, land use, slope angle, slope aspect, roads and streams, a univariate SSFR technique has been tested and applied for calculating the susceptibility score in each class of the selected parameters. Based on factor maps and cumulative score, the landslide susceptibility zones have been developed and validated appearing to be significantly reflecting the pattern of the past landslide events.

TI  - Combining satellite and survey data to study Indian slums: evidence on the range of conditions and implications for urban policy
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Projections suggest that most of the global growth in population in the next few decades will be in urban centres in Asia and Africa. Most of these additional urban residents will be concentrated in slums. However, government documentation of slums is incomplete and unreliable, and many slums remain undocumented. It is necessary to employ creative methods to locate and sample these understudied populations. We used satellite image analysis and fieldwork to build a sample of Indian slums. We show that living conditions vary along a wide-ranging continuum of wellbeing; different points correspond to different policy needs. We also show that most variation in conditions is due to differences across rather than within neighbourhoods. These findings have important implications for urban policy. First, satellite data can be a useful tool to locate undocumented settlements. Second, policy must be appropriately nuanced to respond to wide-ranging needs. Finally, variation patterns suggest that policies should be targeted at the neighbourhood rather than the individual level.

TI  - COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS IN THE MORAL SELF-DETERMINATION OF BELIEVERS OF THE ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS USING THE EXAMPLE OF ISLAM AND ORTHODOX CHRISTIANITY
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The religious worldview, religious values and religious ethics are an integral element of culture at all stages of its historical existence. Religiosity is one of the universal forms of motivating a person's moral choice. For a particular community or person - subjects of religious faith and practice - it is their religious traditions that appear as a kind of concentration of moral self-determination attitudes. The aim of the study is to generalize the role of religious traditions in the moral self-determination of believers of the Abrahamic religions (by the example of Islam and Orthodox Christianity). The article analyses the humanistic core of moral ideas of religious traditions of Islam and Orthodox Christianity. The possibilities of moral self-determination of believers at individual, cultural and community level are revealed. The article raises the question of individual responsibility of religious leaders for the moral vector of relevant practices not only at the centralized, but primarily at the local level of functioning of the religious communities.

TI  - Revisiting the excavation field-school of Arcy-sur-Cure (Yonne), 1946-1963: (paleo-)ethnological essay on the history of techniques and practices of contemporary prehistoric archaeology
T2  - BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE PREHISTORIQUE FRANCAISE
M3  - Article
AB  - The analogical transferring of a technological approach used in Prehistory towards the History of sciences, is a new method for the study of the everyday-ethnographic scientific practices, which uses the analysis of operational sequences (chaines operatoires) of scientific techniques. The study of excavation techniques is best suited to illustrate this as excavation is a complex sequence of the removal of cuts and fills, surfaces and volumes that brings into play archaeological deposits and the scientific know-how and skills of the archaeologists.Using the archives of Andre Leroi-Gourhan's excavation field-school at Arcy-sur-Cure (Yonne, France, 1946-1963), we aim to present a case study, which we find relevant for three reasons. Firstly, it is an important source of evidence concerning the intellectual and social complexity of humans during the transition towards the Upper Palaeolithic. Secondly, it was a locus of methodological innovation, particularly in relation to the development of excavation techniques of "habitation surfaces". Thirdly, it provides an overview of the unreleased archives, the data remaining largely unpublished.Our case study is based on the analysis of documentation relating to the first excavation campaign at the grotte du Renne during the summer of 1949. This body of work includes a series of written documents that pertain to the entire research cycle: from administrative files and personal correspondence, working papers such as hand-written field journals and preliminary campaign reports, to the final reports and drafts of scientific papers. It also contains an ensemble of visual documents such as field-sketches, stratigraphic profiles, and artistic perspectives, as well as a series of photographic takes and film recordings of the daily flow of activities on the field.In the last three decades, the archaeological record of the grotte du Renne has been entangled in a scientific debate on the behavioural and cognitive capacities of the last Neanderthal. It represents one of the exceptional sites where fossil remains were directly linked to personal ornaments, lithic, bone, and antler technologies of "Upper-Palaeolithic-look", and mammoth tusk and stone slab structures. Nevertheless, scholars question the integrity of such a correlation on the grounds of an alleged incoherence concerning the reliability of the stratigraphic levels and the 3D recording of vestiges on the living surfaces.The answer to the question on the integrity of the archaeological record of the grotte du Renne lies beyond the simple evaluation of the collections and other data under the light of current scientific criteria. We are dealing with a corpus of data produced by a scientific worldview dating to nearly a century ago within the socio-historical context of post-Second World War France. In order to address such questions this research proposes a historical re-contextualization of the first excavation campaign at the grotte du Renne.Reconstructing the excavation sequence (chaine operatoire de la fouille) requires analysis of the indirect traces of the excavation's technical performance recorded in the documents (e.g. a photographic take of a stratigraphic profile analysed not as a direct source of information of the sediments but as an indirect testimony of excavation's installations, tools, procedures, etc.). This analysis builds up a detailed story of the excavation almost on a daily basis as well as the plan and 3D models of the entire sequence of operations. These constitute in turn the empirical source for the construction of a comprehension of the operations from the point of view of the excavators. Using this empirical basis, we are able to interpret and to define the scientific goals of the excavators as well as the methodological aims that were developed to attain them, while taking stock of the historical significance of their work within the comparative framework of the period. Effectively, the 1950's and 1960's were fundamental in revising the chrono-cultural classifications of Middle and Upper Palaeolithic lithic industries. The "bataille perigordienne" was brought to a head by a multiplicity of traditions originating from multiple local and foreign sources that indicated, for instance, a local development of anatomically Modern Humans from a Mousterian of Acheulean Tradition source, whilst denying the capacity of invention of Upper Palaeolithic lithic technologies to the last Neanderthal.Our micro-historical analysis of the part played by Leroi-Gourhan's field-school at Arcy-sur-Cure, underlines its role in the postulation of Neanderthal behavioural and cognitive modernity by proving his socio-cultural complexity. The development of recording techniques of "habitation structures" was one of the innovative aspects of Leroi-Gourhan's school. The professionalization of excavation and the construction of alliances amongst local amateurs was the counterpart of Leroi-Gourhan's strategy in order to construct a new and solid institutional niche for prehistoric archaeology in the academic sphere during the post War years to the 1960's, which culminated in the development of modern "ethnographic excavation" techniques. This was one of the unforeseen developments of the Arcy-sur-Cure experience at the excavation-field school of Pincevent (Seine-et-Marne from 1964 onwards).

TI  - Enhanced surveillance of syphilis cases among men who have sex with men in London, October 2016-January 2017
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STD & AIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Syphilis rates have been increasing in men who have sex with men (MSM) in London. To describe risk behaviour and refine public health interventions, we conducted prospective enhanced surveillance of new syphilis cases in MSM attending selected London sexual health clinics (SHCs) between October 2016 and January 2017. Sexual health advisors (SHAs) completed 107 questionnaires. Eighteen per cent of respondents reported always using condoms, with lower use in HIV-positive (8%, 4/53) than HIV-negative men (33%, 14/52). Almost half of respondents reported condomless sero-discordant sex (46%, 33/72). The most frequent means of meeting new partners reported were venues (80%, 76/95), particularly bars or clubs (34%, 32/95), and apps or websites (79%, 75/95). Nearly a third of respondents reported engaging in group sex (32%, 30/95). Almost half reported drug use during sex (47%, 46/98), with HIV-positive men more likely to report use of the three main 'chemsex' drugs. The majority of respondents preferred health promotion information from SHAs (63%, 58/92) compared to other sources such as Google/Wikipedia and apps. Prevention activity should continue to focus on condomless sex, serosorting, multiple and overlapping partners, and chemsex. SHCs, particularly those serving HIV-positive men, are important sources for sexual health promotion advice.

TI  - Numerical prediction of tropical cyclones : A review of research at Andhra University
T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Review
AB  - A review of research studies on the numerical prediction of tropical cyclones at Andhra University is presented. Research studies using simplified axi-symmetric primitive equation model had been initiated in 1983. The cumulus parameterization schemes of Arakawa-Schubert, Emanuel, Kain-Fritsch, Grell and Betts-Miller have been tested to simulate the convection associated with the development of an incipient vortex to cyclone intensity. Results validate the hypotheses based on mass flux formulation, updrafts and downdrafts, convective adjustment under favourable thermodynamic and energy support from ocean. Results with this model had also shown the higher intensity cyclones with higher Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) and originating at lower latitudes.MM5 mesoscale model had been used since 1995 in the prediction of tropical cyclones over Bay of Bengal. Experiments have shown the advantages of nested domains with two-way interaction strategy. Sensitivity experiments depicted that the combination of Kain-Fritsch scheme for convection, Mellor-Yamada scheme for PBL and mixed phase scheme for explicit moisture better simulation in terms of intensification and movement. The need for compatibility between horizontal and vertical resolutions had been emphasized. Dynamical analysis revealed that stretching dominates the vorticity enhancement confirming the CISK hypothesis. The applicability of interpreting potential vorticity fields in the prediction of cyclone track had been identified.A comparison study revealed better performance of WRF model than MM5 model in the prediction of tropical cyclones. Sensitivity experiments with WRF model reconfirmed the combination of parameterization schemes of Kain-Fritsch for convection, YSU scheme for planetary boundary layer, LIN for explicit microphysics and NOAH land surface scheme yielded better prediction in terms of intensity and movement. The need for vortex initialization and assimilation of satellite data towards the improvement of initial conditions was demonstrated through several experiments. The advantages of ensemble prediction over single deterministic prediction had been ascertained.This review illustrates the continued research activity on the numerical prediction of tropical cyclones at Andhra University.

TI  - Systematic sampling of adults as a sensitive means of detecting persistence of lymphatic filariasis following mass drug administration in Sri Lanka
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sri Lanka's Anti-Filariasis Campaign conducted 5 annual rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) plus albendazole to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) in all endemic districts between 2002 and 2006. Post-MDA surveillance has consistently documented Wuchereria bancrofti microfilaremia (Mf) rates below 1% in all sentinel and spot check sites since that time, and all implementation units easily satisfied WHO's target for school-based transmission assessment surveys (school-TAS) in 2013. However, more detailed studies have identified foci of persistent infection in the large coastal evaluation unit (EU) (population about 0.6 million) in Galle district. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the sensitivity and feasibility of community-based TAS in adults (adult-TAS) and to compare results obtained by adult-TAS with prior school-TAS and molecular xenomonitoring (MX, molecular detection of filarial DNA in systematically sampled mosquitoes) results in this known problem area.Methodology and principal findings Two cluster surveys were performed in independent samples of 30 evaluation areas (EAs) in the coastal Galle EU in 2015. Each survey tested approximately 1,800 adults for circulating filarial antigenemia (CFA) with the Alere Filariasis Test Strip. The CFA prevalence for all persons tested (N = 3,612) was 1.8% (CI 1.4-2.2), and this was significantly higher than the CFA rate of 0.4% obtained by school-TAS in 2013. CFA prevalences in the two samples were similar [1.5% (CI 1.0-2.2), and 2.0% (CI 1.4-2.7)]. Antigenemia prevalence in sampled EUs was highly variable (range 0-11%), and it exceeded 5% in 6 EAs. The 30 EAs sampled in one of our adult-TAS surveys had recently been assessed for persistent filariasis by molecular xenomonitoring (MX). CFA prevalence in adults and filarial DNA prevalence in mosquitoes in these EAs were significantly correlated (r = 0.43; P = 0.02).Conclusions Community based adult-TAS provided a reproducible measure of persistent W. bancrofti infection in a large evaluation unit in Sri Lanka that has low-level persistence of LF following multiple rounds of MDA. In addition, adult-TAS and MX results illustrate the focality of persistent LF in this setting. Adult-TAS may be more sensitive than school-TAS for this purpose. Adult-TAS and MX are potential options for post-MDA and post-validation surveillance programs to identify problem areas that require mop-up activities. Adult-TAS should also be useful for remapping areas with uncertain LF endemicity for possible inclusion in national LF elimination programs.Author summary Lymphatic filariasis (LF, also commonly known as elephantiasis) is a leading cause of disability in the developing world. It is caused by parasitic worms that are transmitted by mosquitoes. The Sri Lankan Anti-Filariasis Campaign provided five annual rounds of MDA with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole in all infected areas between 2002 and 2006, and this reduced infection prevalence to very low levels in all sentinel and spot check sites. Sri Lanka conducted transmission assessment surveys (TAS, surveys for filarial antigenemia in primary school children) based on WHO guidelines in 2012-2013, and all evaluation units (EUs) in formerly endemic areas easily passed this test. However, other types of post-MDA surveys (antigenemia and microfilaremia assessments in communities, anti-filarial antibody assessment in primary grade school children and mosquito monitoring for filarial DNA) have shown evidence of persistent LF in Sri Lanka, with the strongest signals in a coastal EU in Galle district. Results from this study show that adult-TAS efficiently detected residual filarial infections in this EU that had passed school-TAS. Adult-TAS results were highly correlated with results from prior surveys that used molecular xenomonitoring (MX) to detect filarial parasite DNA in pools of mosquitoes collected in the same study areas. Thus adult-TAS and MX should be considered as an alternative surveillance approaches for verifying that LF has been eliminated following MDA and for identifying areas that require additional intervention.

TI  - Downscaling of MODIS thermal imagery
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, integration of two models TsHARP (Tsharp) and Thin plate spline (TPS) has been performed for spatial sharpening of 1 km (coarse) resolution of MODIS thermal imagery to 250 m resolution. Afterwards it was validated with LANDSAT-7 thermal data (after resampled to 250 m pixel). The results showed that LST based on integration of two (TsHARP and TPS) models is consistent with true data (LANDSAT-7 ETM+, thermal data). We have observed R-2 at pure cropped area, cropped area with low settlement and cropped area with high settlement is showing, 0.74 (Multi R = 0.80, Adju R = 0.75 and p = .001), 0.72 (Multi R = 0.78, Adju R = 72 and p = .001) and 0.71 (Multi R = 0.78, Adju R = 0.71 and p = .001) respectively. While overall R-2 of 0.69 (Multi R = 0.76, Adju R = 0.71 and p = .000) for all categories of classes (cropped area + cropped area with low settlement + cropped area with high settlement). LST shows root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.307 degrees C, Relative-RMSE (R-RMSE) = 0.167 degrees C, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.033 degrees C, normalized RMSE (NRMSE) = 0.018 degrees C, index of agreement (d) = 0.99, RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) = 0.39 and RMSE% = 0.02 for merging process based LST. We conclude that combination of TsHARP and TPS model has a great potential to estimate LST at 250 m with high temporal resolution. This LST can be used as an input in various models to estimate other components which are LST dependent. (C) 2018 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Seasonal aerosol variations over a coastal city, Zhoushan, China from CALIPSO observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the observed seasonal aerosol variations over Zhoushan, an eastern coastal Chinese city. Data were obtained from the Cloud - Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite from the period of June 2007 to May 2017. We compared the columnar Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data from the GAUPSO and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Results showed good consistency, but the former was systematically lower than the latter. The temporal distribution of columnar AOD showed significant variations with the highest in spring and lowest in summer. Similarly, the seasonal scatter plots suggested that the highest correlation coefficient was 0.56 in winter and summer, followed by the autumn (0.53), and spring (0.40) seasons. In addition, the results revealed that the polluted dust and polluted continental aerosols (38.9% and 30.5%, respectively) were dominant aerosol subtypes observed in winter, whereas, the polluted dust (47.2%) aerosol subtype was found dominant in spring. The polluted continental aerosol subtype appeared dominant during the summer and autumn seasons, with the frequencies of about 56.0% and 47.4%, respectively. These findings can be reasonably explained using the air mass cluster analysis computed for the obtained backward trajectories derived from the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Furthermore, the aerosol vertical extinction coefficient measured at the wavelength of 532 nm was found to be highest near the surface (similar to 0.2 km(-1)) in winter and autumn and decreased sharply as the altitude increased indicating that aerosols were present at an altitude < 2 km. However, during spring, the values of extinction coefficient remained > 0.15 km(-1) at an altitude range of 0-3.5 km due to convection and strong vertical mixing lifting aerosols to slightly higher levels. Furthermore, during the spring, approximately 54% of the particulate depolarization ratio (PDR) values were <= 0.2, and the remaining 46% of the PDR were > 0.2, suggesting both spherical and irregular particles were present in the atmosphere.

TI  - Preparing for the Future Impacts of Megastorms on Archaeological Sites: An Evaluation of Flooding from Hurricane Harvey, Houston, Texas
T2  - AMERICAN ANTIQUITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Powerful hurricanes in 2017-Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria-were stark examples of how these previously rare catastrophes are becoming increasingly normal due to climate change, with dire consequences for cultural resources. These storms, sometimes called megastorms or superstorms, were the first in which high-resolution satellite imagery was available in the immediate aftermath, providing a new tool for rapidly evaluating damage to archaeological sites. Using Hurricane Harvey as a case study, we examined two recent spatial models of archaeological site vulnerability to long-term climate change to determine whether these models are also adequate for predicting the impacts of short-term climate catastrophes. We further examined a number of individual variables that we expected to be useful in predicting which sites would be most vulnerable to flooding, such as proximity to rivers, the coast, or the floodplain. Neither the models nor the individual variables correlated well to increased risk to archaeological sites, with the exception of land use. Sites located within developed areas benefited from measures to protect property and were less often flooded. We suggest that strategies for responding to megastorms would be most effective through a combination of preparedness, analysis of remote sensing data, and existing field research methods.

TI  - A simple regional snow hydrological process-based snow depth model and its application in the Upper Yangtze River Basin
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow depth plays a significant role in the regional water balance, for which snowfall is usually determined by a fixed temperature threshold in regional snow research. This study developed a regional hydrological process-based snow depth model in the Upper Yangtze River Basin by using spatially distributed critical temperature data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and station data. Based on meteorological station and remotely sensed data, daily snow hydrological components from 1 August 2003 to 31 July 2015 were simulated. Results show that the simulated snow depth patterns agreed with those of the observed snow depth. The multi-year average of the starting date and ending date of snow duration was 16 October and 6 June, respectively, and that of maximum annual snowfall was approximately 455 mm, of which canopy interception comprised 10%, with a maximum value of 50 mm. The proportion of snow sublimation was less than 20%, which was contributed by interception sublimation (40%), snow surface sublimation (40%) and sublimation underneath the canopy (20%). The maximum annual snow sublimation was 29 mm. Snow melting was the primary snow consumption pathway, and approximately 70% of snowfall melted. This research is significant for the assessment and management of water resources in this region.

TI  - Changes of breast and axillary surgery patterns in patients with primary breast cancer during the past decade
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeBreast-conserving therapy (BCT) is the standard procedure for most patients with primary breast cancer (BC). By contrast, axillary management is still under transition to find the right balance between avoiding of morbidity, maintaining oncological safety, and performing a staging procedure. The rising rate of primary systemic therapy creates further challenges for surgical management.MethodsPatients with primary, non-metastatic BC treated between 01.01.2003 and 31.12.2016 under guideline-adherent conditions were included in this study. For this prospectively followed cohort, breast and axillary surgery patterns are presented in a time-trend analysis as annual rate data (%) for several subgroups.ResultsOverall, 6700 patients were included in the analysis. While BCT rates remained high (mean 2003-2016: 70.4%), the proportion of axillary lymph node dissection has declined considerably from 80.1% in 2003 to 16.0% in 2016, while the proportion for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLND) has increased correspondingly from 10.3 to 76.4%. Among patients with cT1-2, cN0 breast cancer receiving BCT with positive SLND, the rate of axillary completion has decreased from 100% in 2008 to 24.4% in 2016.ConclusionsIn the past decade, SLNB has been established as the standard procedure for axillary staging of clinically node-negative patients. Surgical morbidity has been further reduced by the rapid implementation of new evidence from the ACOSOG Z0011 trial into clinical routine. The results reflect the transition towards more individually tailored, less invasive treatment for selected patient subgroups, especially in regards to axillary lymph node management.

TI  - Estimating fractional cover of tundra vegetation at multiple scales using unmanned aerial systems and optical satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional cover of green vegetation (FCover) is a key variable when observing Arctic vegetation under a changing climate. Vegetation changes over large areas are traditionally monitored by linking plot-scale measurements to satellite data. However, integrating field and satellite data is not straightforward. Typically, the satellite data are at a much coarser scale in comparison to field measurements. Here, we studied how Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) can be used to bridge this gap. We covered three 250 m x 250 m sites in Fennoscandian tundra with varying productivity ana FCover, ranging from barren vegetation to shrub tundra. The UAS sites were then used to train satellite data-based FCover models.First, we created a binary vegetation classification (absent, present) by using UAS-derived RGB-orthomosaics and logistic regression. Secondly, we used the classification to calculate FCover to Planet CubeSat (3 m), Sentinel-2A MSI (10 m, 20 m), and Landsat 8 OLI (30 m) grids, and examined how well FCover is explained by various spectral vegetation indices (VI) derived from satellite data.The overall classification accuracies for the UAS sites were >= 90%. The UAS-FCover were strongly related to the tested VIs (D-2 89% at best). The explained deviance was generally higher for coarser resolution data, indicating that the effect of data resolution should be taken into account when comparing results from different sensors. VIs based on red-edge (at 740 nm, 783 nm), or near-infrared and shortwave infrared (SWIR) had the highest performance. We recommend wider inspection of red-edge and SWIR bands for future Arctic vegetation research.Our results demonstrate that UASs can be used for observing FCover at multiple scales. Individual UAS sites can serve as focus areas, which provide information at the finest resolution (e.g. individual plants), whereas a sample of several UAS sites can be used to train satellite data and examine vegetation over larger extents.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and CO2 absorption by agroforestry systems: An assessment for Central Plateau and Hill region of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - India ranks fourth in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and accounts for 6% of total GHG emissions in the world. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has major contribution of 76% in total GHG emissions. Agroforestry that integrates trees in the agricultural landscape is regarded as a strategy for both adaptation and mitigation of climate change. Agroforestry plays an important role in reducing the level of GHG emissions vis-a-vis atmospheric CO2 through carbon sequestration. Carbon sequestration is the process involved in carbon capture and the long period storage of atmospheric CO2. In the present study, firstly area under agroforestry was estimated in Central Plateau and Hill region (agro-climatic zone-8) using satellite remote sensing data. Secondly, dynamic CO2FIX model v3.1 was used to assess the baseline total carbon and carbon sequestration potential (CSP) of agroforestry systems for a simulation period of 30yr. Finally, equivalent CO2 absorption was assessed with the help of estimated agroforestry area and net CSP in the zone. Estimated area in Central Plateau and Hill region is about 1.96 million ha, which is 5.18% of total geographical area of this zone. Total carbon sequestered at zone level was estimated to be 17.81Tg (tera gram) C and equivalent CO2 absorption is at 65.36 Tg. The CSP of agroforestry systems would be about 158.55 Tg C for a simulated period of 30 yr or CSP would be 5.28Tg C yr-1 at country level. On the other hand, equivalent CO2 absorption was 586.50 Tg for a period of 30 yr or would be 19.55 Tg yr-1 at country level. Hence, the present study concludes that agroforestry has significant contribution in reduction of atmospheric CO2 which would have much more if the area under agroforestry and/or number of trees ha-1 on farmlands are increased.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Thick Primary Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The clinical value of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with thick melanoma is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlations between survival and lymph node status in thick melanomas.Methods: Of a total of 736 melanoma patients registered between 2000 and 2016, 50 presented with thick melanomas (>= 4.0 mm) without distant metastatic disease. All patients were examined with a whole-body magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography, and positron emission tomography-computed tomography depending on the incorporation of the new technology in our medical institutions. They were studied according to the following procedure: 1) preoperative determination of regional lymph node along with the estimation and localization of sentinel lymph node (SLN) (dynamic isotope lymphography); 2) intraoperative localization and SLNB (lymphatic mapping); and 3) histopathology. Patient and tumor features were collected.Results: Mean follow-up was 40 months, and 37% had a follow-up >= 5 years. A positive SLN was identified in 28 patients (56%). No significant difference in melanoma-specific overall survival was observed in terms of the primary tumor site. Hazard ratios (HRs) were statistically significant for SLNB-positive group and mitotic rate (MR) > 3 mm(2), but not for presence of ulceration. Mortality risk in the SLN-positive group was almost fourfold greater than that in the SLN-negative group at any time of follow-up.Conclusions: SLN status, along with MR, can provide valuable prognostic information in patients with thick primary cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - Corporate Mobility - The Involvement of Employees
T2  - EUROPEAN COMPANY AND FINANCIAL LAW REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In April 2018, the European Commission presented a proposal for a Directive amending Directive 2017/1132 as regards cross-border conversions, mergers and divisions. This article discusses the proposed provisions to protect the interests of employees in a cross-border operation. Their position would be strengthened since employee representatives are granted information and consultation rights. As to the protection of existing board level employee representation rights, the Proposal follows the EU legal framework on the involvement of employees, consisting of a negotiation process between representatives of the employees and the management. As Standard Rules apply if no agreement can be reached, negotiations take place with the law as a sentinel. Practice has shown that this complicated legal framework is effective in protecting existing employee participation rights. The Proposal shows that in 2019, this carefully vetted political compromise leaves EU legislators little room to manoeuvre by simplifying the framework or strengthening the position of employees.

TI  - Multi-temporal Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change analysis of a dry semi-arid river basin in western India following a robust multi-sensor satellite image calibration strategy
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite data calibration is an inherent problem in remote sensing-based applications. If multiple satellite scenes cover the study area, it is difficult to compare and process the images for change detection and long-term trend analysis of the same day and/or seasons from different satellites or sensors. Moreover, the validation of all the past images is a challenge due to unavailability of past ground truth datasets. The proposed calibration paradigm in this study is based on radiance normalization in the spatial and spectral domain to ease the alignment of multiple images into an identical radiometric foundation. In this study, an intuitive radiometric correction technique (at a daily, monthly and yearly scale) was proposed, aimed at all Landsat sensors' datasets for long-term Land Use Land Cover (LULC) trend analysis for a dry semi-arid river basin in western India, facing drought conditions. The post-calibration mosaiced images were smooth, and meaningful LULC classification results could be obtained easily for all the years. The LULC change dynamics were analyzed and compared for the years 1972, 1980, 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2016 in Shivna River Basin. During these study periods, wasteland was found to be the most altered class, followed by agricultural land and forest. The spatial extent of agricultural land was found to decrease linearly, while forest cover showed an exponential decrease; a linear increase was observed in wasteland. Though during the 44 years study period (1972-2016), 241.48 km(2) area was converted to agricultural land from wasteland, but more than double that land was converted to wasteland from agricultural land; alarmingly, 5.18% (8.12% in 1972 and 2.94% in 2016) forest cover decreased. The existing forest cover in 2016 is approximately one-third compared to 1972. The present work provides a generic framework for the calibration of multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite images for long-term LULC trend analysis, which can be adopted for other satellite datasets.

TI  - Variability in breast cancer surgery training across Europe: An ESSO-EUSOMA international survey
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: At present there is a lack of standardization of training in breast cancer surgery across Europe. The aim of this survey was to assess current practice in Europe regarding training in breast cancer (BC) surgery.Material and methods: General surgeons, surgical oncologists, gynecologist, and plastic surgeons in Europe were invited to participate in this bespoke survey including 19 questions.Results: The survey was sent to 3.000 surgical oncologists across Europe. A total of 671 physicians (387 general surgeons, 152 gynecologists, 126 surgical oncologist, 31 plastic surgeons) answered the survey (23% response rate). Four hundred and sixty-eight physicians devoted between 50%-100% of their job to treating breast cancer. 45% worked in a community/University hospital within a dedicated Breast Unit. Specific additional breast surgery training was not universal: 20% had undertaken an accredited breast fellowship, 30% in a Breast Unit as a trainee, 21% had done additional courses, masters or diploma and 8% had not done any additional training. The majority (61%) of respondents worked in Units treating >150 BC cases per year, while 26% of the responders treat >120 new primary cases per year, and 23% less than 50 new cases a year. Multivariate analysis showed that breast surgeons working in a Breast Unit and treating more than 50 cases/year significantly performed oncoplastic procedures.Conclusion: There is a great variability in breast cancer surgery training in Europe. It is imperative to develop quality standards for breast cancer surgery training to ensure that patients get standardized and certified surgical management regardless of the country in which they are treated.

T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study aimed to investigate the eight heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, Co, Pb, and Cd) occurrence and risk assessment in the sediment and sentinel crab (Macrophthalmus depressus) from the mangrove and coastal environment of industrialized and mega city Karachi, Pakistan. The sediment analyzed for physiochemical properties (grain size composition, organic matter, and heavy metals), that presented significant variability (p < 0.05) among the selected sites. The environmental health and ecotoxicological profile of the habitat determined through the enrichment factor (EF), adverse effect index (AEI) and potential ecological risk index (RI) that revealed high anthropogenic influences along the Karachi coast. All heavy metals in crab showed significant spatial differences (p < 0.001) and the strong correlation between the essential and non-essential metals. Sediment-biota accumulation factor (SBAF) suggested active bio-accumulation (>1.0) in crabs for all metals, except Cr. Pb accumulation in crabs showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) with the exposure Pb levels in sediment, which indicated the potential of crab as a bioindicator of Pb contamination. Principal component analysis (PCA) concluded that environmental factors like seawater temperature, salinity, sediment grain size and organic matter had a significant association with different metal accumulation in crabs. The current study revealed the ecological significance of sentinel crab, M. depressus, as they endure with wide range (low to serious RI) of metal contaminated environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Pathogenesis, Host Innate Immune Response, and Aerosol Transmission of Influenza D Virus in Cattle
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The recently discovered influenza D virus (IDV) of the Orthomyxoviridae family has been detected in swine and ruminants with a worldwide distribution. Cattle are considered to be the primary host and reservoir, and previous studies suggested a tropism of IDV for the upper respiratory tract and a putative role in the bovine respiratory disease complex. This study aimed to characterize the pathogenicity of IDV in naive calves as well as the ability of this virus to transmit by air. Eight naive calves were infected by aerosol with a recent French isolate, D/bovine/France/5920/2014. Results show that IDV replicates not only in the upper respiratory tract but also in the lower respiratory tract (LRT), inducing moderate bronchopneumonia with restricted lesions of interstitial pneumonia. Inoculation was followed by IDV-specific IgG1 production as early as 10 days postchallenge and likely both Th1 and Th2 responses. Study of the innate immune response in the LRT of IDV-infected calves indicated the overexpression of pathogen recognition receptors and of chemokines CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4, but without overexpression of genes involved in the type I interferon pathway. Finally, virological examination of three aerosol-sentinel animals, housed 3 m apart from inoculated calves (and thus subject to infection by aerosol transmission), and IDV detection in air samples collected in different areas showed that IDV can be airborne transmitted and infect naive contact calves on short distances. This study suggests that IDV is a respiratory virus with moderate pathogenicity and probably a high level of transmission. It consequently can be considered predisposing to or a cofactor of respiratory disease.IMPORTANCE Influenza D virus (IDV), a new genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family, has a broad geographical distribution and can infect several animal species. Cattle are so far considered the primary host for IDV, but the pathogenicity and the prevalence of this virus are still unclear. We demonstrated that under experimental conditions (in a controlled environment and in the absence of coinfecting pathogens), IDV is able to cause mild to moderate disease and targets both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The virus can transmit by direct as well as aerosol contacts. While this study evidenced overexpression of pathogen recognition receptors and chemokines in the lower respiratory tract, IDV-specific IgG1 production as early as 10 days postchallenge, and likely both Th1 and Th2 responses, further studies are warranted to better understand the immune responses triggered by IDV and its role as part of the bovine respiratory disease complex.

TI  - Assessment of sedimentary pigments and phytoplankton determined by CHEMTAX analysis as biomarkers of unusual upwelling conditions in summer 2014 off the SE coast of Algarve
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we tested the validity of sedimentary pigments and phytoplankton as biomarkers of upwelling events. Based on the evidence from satellite and reanalysis datasets that unusually intense upwelling conditions occurred in summer 2014 off the SE coast of Algarve (Portugal), we looked at pigments and phytoplankton before and after summer 2014 in order to test their use as biomarkers of upwelling conditions. From the analysis of summer anomalies with respect to the 2003-2014 average, we show that summer 2014 was characterized by exceptional westerly winds, colder waters and higher chlorophyll, pointing to unusual upwelling conditions. In order to confirm or not the intense upwelling in summer 2014 suggested by satellite data, the concentration of sedimentary pigments has been quantified. Sediments were sampled off the SE Algarve coast in spring and in summer-autumn 2014, above 60 m depth. Labile sedimentary pigments have been used as indicators of recently produced and non-degraded organic matter available as good quality food for consumers. We tested if the particular oceanographic conditions observed in summer 2014 were registered by sedimentary pigments by comparing their concentration and vertical distribution in spring and in summer-autumn. Based on the data on sedimentary pigments, also the phytoplankton composition has been studied. CHEMTAX software has been used to quantify the taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton community and it has been found that the relative contribution of dinoflagellates and diatoms to Chl-a was highest both in spring and in summer-autumn. Based on the SIMPER test, the contribution of dinoflagellates and diatoms to the average square distance between seasons was low, suggesting weaker stratification of the water column also in summer-autumn, maybe related to the intense upwelling conditions of summer 2014. Oceanographic data, together with the distribution of sedimentary pigments and phytoplankton taxa in spring and in summer autumn, suggest that exceptional upwelling events occurred in summer 2014 off the SE coast of Algarve.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - As the most frequently reported vector-borne disease among active component U.S. service members, with an incidence rate of 16 cases per 100,000 person-years in 2011, Lyme disease poses both a challenge to healthcare providers in the Military Health System and a threat to military readiness. Spread through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick, infection with the bacterial cause of Lyme disease can have lasting effects that may lead to medical discharge from the military. The U.S. Military Academy at West Point is situated in a highly endemic area in New York State. To identify probable areas where West Point cadets as well as active duty service members stationed at West Point and their families might contract Lyme disease, this study used Geographic Information System mapping methods and remote sensing data to replicate an established spatial model to identify the likely habitat of a key host animal--the white-tailed deer.

TI  - Automatic Building Footprint Extraction from Multi-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Using a Hybrid FCN
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent technical developments made it possible to supply large-scale satellite image coverage. This poses the challenge of efficient discovery of imagery. One very important task in applications like urban planning and reconstruction is to automatically extract building footprints. The integration of different information, which is presently achievable due to the availability of high-resolution remote sensing data sources, makes it possible to improve the quality of the extracted building outlines. Recently, deep neural networks were extended from image-level to pixel-level labelling, allowing to densely predict semantic labels. Based on these advances, we propose an end-to-end U-shaped neural network, which efficiently merges depth and spectral information within two parallel networks combined at the late stage for binary building mask generation. Moreover, as satellites usually provide high-resolution panchromatic images, but only low-resolution multi-spectral images, we tackle this issue by using a residual neural network block. It fuses those images with different spatial resolution at the early stage, before passing the fused information to the Unet stream, responsible for processing spectral information. In a parallel stream, a stereo digital surface model (DSM) is also processed by the Unet. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method generalizes for use in cities which are not included in the training data.

TI  - Optimization of sentinel lymph node identification techniques in the Indian setting: A randomized clinical trial
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The recommended technique of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer is a combination of blue dye and radiotracer. In the Indian scenario, SLNB is still not routinely practiced due to lack of nuclear medicine facilities and unavailability of isosulfan blue or patent blue violet (PBV). This study was conducted for optimizing SLN identification techniques by comparing the identification rate using PBV and methylene blue (MB) in combination with radiotracer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-blinded two-arm parallel design randomized control trial was conducted at an apex teaching and research medical institute in India. Patients with axillary LNunegative breast cancer were included. Blue dye and radio tracer were injected preoperatively, and SLNB was performed using a combination technique. Frozen section was performed. Demographic, clinical, radiological, operative, and histopathological data were recorded. Descriptive statistics were used to represent patient characteristics. Baseline characteristics for entire cohort and between groups were compared using Student's t-test for quantitative variables and Chi-square test for qualitative variables. RESULTS: A total of 119 patients were randomized for mapping with MB and 118 patients with PBV between 2011 and 2015. SLN was identified in 116 patients with MB and 115 with PBV. SLN identification proportions were 97.4% (MB) and 96.6% (PBV). In patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection, concordance with SLNB was 98.5% and 96.61% in MB and PBV, respectively. False-negative proportion for MB was 2.56% and 7.69% for PBV, respectively. The cost of MB is about INR 15 per 10-mL vial. The cost of PBV is approximately $91 per ampoule (equivalent to approximately INR 8190). CONCLUSION: SLNB using MB can be recommended as the technique of choice in low-resource settings.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantitative model of the Earth is provided by optical and radar space-borne remote sensing global digital elevation models (GDEMs). GDEMs are fundamental for many geo-spatial analysis and demanded by several applications that need topographical data. Recently released ALOS World 3D 30m (AW3D30) and 1 arc-second (30m) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) C-band GDEMs have the advantages of high quality and free availability from JAXA and NASA and much in demand in scientific community. In this paper, we comprehensively analyzed the discontinuities between AW3D30 and SRTM C-band GDEMs in country-scale calculating and interpreting the influence of terrain inclination and land cover classes. The coherence between two GDEMs was estimated by absolute horizontal and vertical accuracy analysis in the basis of model-to-model validation approaches. During the analysis, standard deviation and normalized median absolute deviation of height differences between GDEMs were utilized as the main coherence indicators. The frequency distribution of height differences and the incoherent outliers were presented by error distribution graphics and height error maps, respectively. The results clearly demonstrated the significance of ascending and descending orbits, terrain inclination, and land cover on the discontinuities.

TI  - The spatio-temporal trends of urban growth and surface urban heat islands over two decades in the Semarang Metropolitan Region
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper conveys the findings of a study of the development of Semarang Metropolitan Region (SMR) over two decades. The developments seen were urbanisation and its impact on Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHI). This research used remote sensing data satellite imagery of Landsat 5 T M and Landsat 8 OLI to see land cover change from 1998 to 2018. Furthermore, to predict the land cover change, this research used a Stochastic Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (SCA-MC) algorithm. Measurements of the LST and SUHI used Landsat products with Thermal Infra-Red Sensors (TIRS) Band 10 (2018) and TIRS Band 6 (1998). The classification of the results from 1998 to 2018 indicates a widespread change in the built-up area of about 74.62%, revealing urban expansion in the SMR. Moreover, there has been a decline in the vegetation canopy of 36.14%, resulting in an increase in average surface temperature of 2-5 degrees C. Areas with increased surface temperatures reached more than 30 degrees C, which is an increase of 245.57 km(2) from 1998 to 2018. Furthermore, the SCA-MC prediction suggests the scenario to mitigate the SUHI through Spatial planning instruments. Thus, control of development is essential to the sustainability of the SMR, through land use planning scenarios.

T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Integration of geospatial techniques (remote sensing and geographical information system) for the identification of groundwater potential has become an important tool in evaluating, monitoring and conserving groundwater resources. Effective utilization of groundwater resources has become important due to changing climatic scenario. Hence, estimating the zones of potential groundwater recharge is extremely important for the protection and management of water quality of groundwater systems. In this study, Rambiara river basin, southern-eastern part of Kashmir valley, was examined to assess its groundwater resource potential. Geospatial techniques were used to assimilate five causative factors: lithology/geology, land useand land cover, lineaments, drainage, and slope. The factor weight contributing to the groundwater recharge was acquired using satellite image data, lithological/geological maps, and a land use/land cover database followed by field validations. Based on the results obtained, it was observed that the premier recharge potential zones are located down the slope of the river basin due to the dominance of alluvium and agricultural land. Hard rock lithology located towards upstream areas of the basin allows less water to infiltrate.

TI  - Ship Classification in SAR Images Using a New Hybrid CNN-MLP Classifier
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection on the SAR images for marine monitoring has a wide usage. SAR technology helps us to have a better monitoring over intended sections, without considering atmospheric conditions, or image shooting time. In recent years, with advancements in convolutional neural network (CNN), which is one of the well-known ways of deep learning, using image deep features has increased. Recently, usage of CNN for SAR image segmentation has been increased. Existence of clutter edge, multiple interfering targets, speckle and sea-level clutters makes false alarms and false detections on detector algorithms. In this letter, constant false alarm rate is used for object recognition. This algorithm, processes the image pixel by pixel, and based on statistical information of its neighbor pixels, detects the targeted pixels. Afterward, a neural network with hybrid algorithm of CNN and multilayer perceptron (CNN-MLP) is suggested for image classification. In this proposal, the algorithm is trained with real SAR images from Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 satellites, and has a better performance on object classification than state of the art.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The human-induced desiccation of the Aral Sea has generated large amounts of salt dust and has been posing a great threat to local ecological environment and human health. Monitoring its land cover changes is essential to obtaining information about the desertification process and dynamics of potential salt/sand dust source. To this end, long-term Landsat imagery was applied for the land use/cover change analysis based on support vector machine approach. The land cover distribution of the study area for 1977, 1987, 1996, 2006 and 2015 was mapped. In addition, the Markov-cellular automata integrated approach was used to predict the land cover change in 2015 and project changes in 2025 by extrapolating current trends. The classification results revealed that water surface of the Aral Sea shrunk by more than 66%, leading to the dramatic expanding of the salt soil and bare area. Change detection analysis indicated a serious land degradation trend as well as a major land cover evolution mode in the Aral Kum that could predict shifts in dust composition. The Markov-cellular automata technique was successful in predicting land cover distribution in 2015, and the projected land cover for 2025 revealed more desertification of the landscape with potential expansion in the salt soils and bare area. It is worth noting that the vegetation cover of the region represented an obvious increase in recent years that may be a good signal of ecological recovery.

TI  - Agricultural drought monitoring across Inner Mongolia, China: development, spatiotemporal patterns and impacts
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought is related to meteorological and hydrologic conditions and the resilience vegetation to water deficit that have negative impacts on agricultural production. In this study, an integrated drought condition index (IDCI) was developed by integrating precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, temperature, soil moisture, and vegetation conditions. The performance of IDCI in agricultural drought monitoring was evaluated by comparing with standing drought indices, such as sc-PDSI (self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index), SMCI (Soil Moisture Condition Index), and SCYI (Scaled Crop Yields Index). Then, IDCI was used to characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of agricultural drought across Inner Mongolia, China. Results indicated that: (1) IDCI performed as well in drought monitoring as did sc-PDSI and SCYI. However, IDCI performed better than did SPEI3 (standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index at a time scale of 3 months), SMCI (Soil Moisture Condition Index) and VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) with respect to reliable and stable drought monitoring, detection of soil moisture and reflection of agricultural loss; (2) during the growing season (May-September), the frequency of droughts with higher than moderate drought intensity tended to be diminishing from May to August, and was amplifying again from August to September; (3) during 2000 to 2014, the drought severity was subject to regular variability with consecutive droughts during transitions between drought conditions; (4) compared to SMCI, VCI and SPEI3, IDCI is highly related to SCYI for maize with correlation coefficient of up to 0.788; the correlation coefficients between IDCI and SCYI for soybean and potato are larger than 0.5, while the SCYI for wheat is related to droughts with severe and even higher severity based on IDCI. The idea behind the development of IDCI can be referenced for drought monitoring in other regions of the globe.

TI  - Polarimetric Channel Misregistration Evaluation for the GaoFen-3 QPSI Mode
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter presents two main contributions to the data quality assessment of China's new GaoFen-3 radar satellite. First, we observed a half-pixel misregistration between the horizontal (H) and vertical (V) transmitting channels in the azimuth direction. This was determined by investigating the corner reflector (CR) response of some stripmap products of GaoFen-3 quad-pol stripmap (QPSI) mode. Second, to check whether the azimuth misregistration exists in different beams of QPSI mode, we improved the RADARSAT-2 channel checking method as a tool and evaluated more than 300 stripmap scenes. This letter confirms that the half-pixel misregistration problem, which can cause about 10% decoherence in the co-pol and cross-pol channel correlation coefficients, is common in the GaoFen-3 stripmap products of QPSI mode. Furthermore, the improved method can be considered as an effective way to fix the misregistration problem.

AB  - Aims Quantitative evaluation of the vegetation normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) dynamics plays an important role in understanding of the characteristics of regional ecological environment change and realizing the harmonious and sustainable development between regional ecology and socio-economy.Methods The study employed the supplementary trend analysis with MODIS-NDVI data, analyzed the spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation NDVI and the driving factors behind the changes in Xilin Gol during 2000-2015. Then, the ratio of the overlapped areas to the areas with significant NDVI changes was defined as the contribution rate.Important findings 1) NDVI represented a slow vegetation increase trend and showed a "Northeast high and Southwest low" spatio-temporal pattern. The NDVI significantly increased area was twice of the area significantly reduced. 2) The vegetation NDVI showed a significant spatial heterogeneity under the dual effects of climate and human activities. In the area of NDVI significantly increased, climate factor accounted for 47.79% of the causes, and the precipitation and temperature make nearly equal contributions while the policies of grazing prohibition and balance management between grass and livestock is the most important human factor, accounting for 69.55% of the causes. 3) In the area of NDVI significantly reduced, climate factors accounted for 52.55% of the causes, in which precipitation was the main factor among all. Human activities accounted for 24.73% of the causes. 4) In the area of NDVI significantly increased, the impact of human activities is greater than that of climatic factors, and the coupling effect between them is prominent.

TI  - Investigation of various aerosols over different locations in South Africa using satellite, model simulations and LIDAR
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Decadal studies (2004-2014) of various aerosols were carried out over South Africa (SA) using various satellite data and model simulations. The aerosols investigated included black carbon (BC), sulphate, dust and marine aerosols. BC aerosols were observed to be dominant in the northeastern parts of SA while sulphate aerosols were dominant in eastern parts of the country. Seasonal studies revealed that BC aerosols were more dominant in the eastern parts of SA during spring and less dominant in autumn. Sulphate also showed dominance in the eastern parts of SA during summer and less dominance in winter. The high sulphate concentration in summer is a result of an increase in relative humidity which favours the production of sulphates. Air masses from the north and northeastern parts of the subcontinent were responsible for the transport of BC resulting from biomass burning into SA. The Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport model indicated that there was no significant change in the sulphate aerosol trends from 2004 to 2007. The highest sulphate aerosol levels were observed in the summer whilst the lowest sulphate aerosol levels were observed in winter. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) was used to carry out measurements in Lephalale during July 10-18, 2014. Aerosol extinction co-efficient profiles were retrieved by the CSIR mobile LIDAR and were compared to aerosol extinction co-efficient profiles retrieved from the Cloud-Aerosol LIDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). The aerosol extinction co-efficients of 0.26 and 0.17/km on July 14 and 16, 2014, respectively could be identified as dust aerosols.

TI  - Classification of North Africa for Use as an Extended Pseudo Invariant Calibration Sites (EPICS) for Radiometric Calibration and Stability Monitoring of Optical Satellite Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pseudo invariant calibration sites (PICS) have been extensively used for the radiometric calibration and temporal stability monitoring of optical satellite sensors. Due to limited knowledge about the radiometric stability of North Africa, only a limited number of sites in the region are used for this purpose. This work presents an automated approach to classify North Africa for its potential use as an extended PICS (EPICS) covering vast portions of the continent. An unsupervised classification algorithm identified 19 clusters representing distinct land surface types was used; three clusters were identified with spatial uncertainties within approximately 5% in the shorter wavelength bands and 3% in the longer wavelength bands. A key advantage of the cluster approach is that large numbers of pixels are aggregated into contiguous homogeneous regions sufficiently distributed across the continent to allow multiple imaging opportunities per day, as opposed to imaging a typical PICS once during the sensor's revisit period. This potential increase in temporal resolution could result in increased sensitivity for the quicker identification of changes in sensor response.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is known that changes in urban surface characteristics lead to different urban climates. The surrounding environment directly affects thermal comfort and human behavior. In this respect, for sustainable urban growth, the evaluation of urbanization together with climate change from past to present is also important for planning.The main aim of the study is to propose a retrospective GIS-based change detection method for the monitoring of urban climate change by using satellite images. Two regions with a diameter of 1 km where there are significant constructional changes in Istanbul were selected as the study areas. The comparisons were made through Landsat thermal images during summer between the years 2007 and 2017. The function of the model proposed in the study was tested by evaluating whether the expected climatic changes could be achieved against the constructional changes that took place in the region. The correlations between the regions that get extremely hot/cold and the constructional change areas were examined by the bivariate method. The results showed that the correlations could reach up to a high level when important changes occurred in the areas.

TI  - Dust Detection and Aerosol Properties Over Arabian Sea Using MODIS Data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study deals with the use of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal infrared bands in the dust detection. Eight dust storm cases over the Arabian Sea have been selected (four TERRA and four AQUA) during the year 2002-2008. The brightness temperature (BT) difference method has been applied on MODIS thermal bands 29 (8 mu m), 31 (11 mu m) and 32 (12 mu m) to detect dust storms over the Arabian Sea. The performance assessment of BT differences (BT29-BT31 and BT31-BT32) has shown that BT31-BT32 has performed better to BT29-BT31. We suggest that BT31-BT32 is an effective combination of MODIS bands for dust detection over oceans and sea. The maximum (Dmax) and minimum dust (Dmin) intensity locations have also been identified in all the eight dust storm cases. The aerosol properties (aerosol optical thickness, tau; asymmetry factor g and Angstrom exponent alpha) over Dmax and Dmin have been studied using MODIS Level 2 data. In AQUA dust storms cases tau values (Dmax) were higher than TERRA dust cases, whereas g values were nearly same. The alpha was always positive in case of TERRA dust cases; however in AQUA negative alpha was also reported. Afternoon dust storms are more intense compared to forenoon dust storms and dust particles are also coarser.

TI  - Assessment of glacier stored water in Karakoram Himalaya using satellite remote sensing and field investigation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Karakoram Himalaya (KH) has continental climatic conditions and possesses largest concentration of glaciers outside the polar regions. The melt water from these glaciers is a major contributor to the Indus river. In this study, various methods have been used to estimate the ice volume in the Karakoram Range of glaciers such as Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation (COSI-Corr) method and Area-Volume relations. Landsat 8 satellite data has been used to generate the ice displacement, velocity and thickness map. Our study for 558 Karakoram glaciers revealed that the average ice thickness in Karakoram is 90 m. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey has been conducted in one of the KH glacier i.e. Saser La glacier and the collected GPR data is used for the validation of satellite derived thickness map. GPR measured glacier thickness values are found comparable with satellite estimated values with RMSE of 4.3 m. The total ice volume of the Karakoram glaciers is estimated to be 1607 +/- 19 km(3) (1473 +/- 17 Gt), which is equivalent to 1473 +/- 17 km(3) of water equivalent. Present study also covers the analysis of glacier surface displacement, velocity and ice thickness values with reference to glacier mean slope.

TI  - GIS-based multi-criteria approach for identification of rainwater harvesting zones in upper Betwa sub-basin of Madhya Pradesh, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergent water paucity calls for more resourceful alternatives of water conservation. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is one of the most capable systems to increase availability of water and agriculture output in the semi-arid regions. Nevertheless, the assessment of RWH potential and selection of appropriate RWH locations pose a great challenge for the water managers due to lacking biophysical data and infrastructure. The present study attempts to assess the RWH potential and identifying probable RWH locations in the Betwa sub-basin using geospatial and multiple criteria decision analysis techniques (MCDA). The spatial theme such as land use land cover was derived by supervised classification method and lineament and drainage by edge enhancement method from Landsat ETM+satellite image and other secondary published maps. The surface runoff was determined from modified Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method. These parameters were assigned suitable weights and integrated with a geospatial (GIS) technique to generate RWH site suitability map and to identify possible locations for RWH structures. SCS-CN technique displays that the water-body and built-up areas have high runoff potential, while forest area shows low runoff. The analysis indicates that 5.6% (87.7km(2)) is suitable for percolation tanks, 3% (46.6km(2)) suitable for farm ponds and for check dams (0.7km(2)) of the study area. The study reveals combined methodology of geospatial and MCDA procedures in planning of rainwater harvesting at a regional scale.

TI  - Diagnostic utility of dual 5-hydroxymethylcytosine/Melan-A immunohistochemistry in differentiating nodal nevus from metastatic melanoma: An effective first-line test for the workup of sentinel lymph node specimen
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Distinguishing benign nodal nevus from metastatic melanoma can be diagnostically challenging, with important clinical consequences. Recently, the loss of epigenetic marker, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) expression by immunohistochemistry has been found in melanomas and atypical melanocytic neoplasms. Methods About 41 metastatic melanomas and 20 nodal nevi were retrieved. Nuclear 5-hmC (brown) and cytoplasmic Melan-A Red (red) double immunohistochemical staining was performed. Results Total or partial loss of nuclear expression of 5-hmC was noted in 40/41 metastatic melanomas; these tumor cells were strongly positive for Melan-A Red, except in one case of desmoplastic melanoma. All cases of nodal nevus showed uniformly retained nuclear expression of 5-hmC accompanied by strong Melan-A Red cytoplasmic staining. In two cases containing both nodal nevus and metastatic melanoma, all tumor cells were positive for Melan-A Red, but a nuclear expression of 5-hmC was selectively absent only in the melanoma tumor cells. Conclusion Dual 5-hmC/Melan-A Red immunohistochemistry is highly specific in distinguishing nodal nevus from metastatic melanoma. Our protocol for brown and red chromogens used in this study provides excellent color contrast and is easy to interpret. Furthermore, this dual staining method allows the preservation of limited tumor tissue, which could be used for potential molecular studies.

TI  - Longitudinal variability of the equatorial counter electrojet during the solar cycle 24
T2  - STUDIA GEOPHYSICA ET GEODAETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground and space-based geomagnetic data were used in the investigation of the longitudinal, seasonal and lunar phase dependence of the equatorial counter electrojet (CEJ) occurrence in the Peruvian, Brazilian, African, Indian and Philippine sectors during geomagnetically quiet days from the solar cycle 24 (2008 to 2018). We found that CEJ events occur more frequently during the morning (MCEJ) than in the afternoon (ACEJ). The highest MCEJ and ACEJ occurrence rates were observed for the Brazilian sector. Distinct seasonal dependence was found for each longitudinal sector under investigation. The lunar phase dependence was determined for the first time for the Philippine sector (longitude 125 degrees E), and it was shown to be less pronounced than in the Peruvian, Brazilian and African sectors. We demonstrate that differences in CEJ rates derived from ground-based and satellite data can arise from the longitudinal separation between low-latitude and equatorial stations that are used to determine the signal and its consequent time delay in their sunrise/sunset times at ionospheric heights.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Small Icebergs in Fast Ice Using Satellite Wide-Swath SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic detection of icebergs in satellite images is regarded a useful tool to provide information necessary for safety in Arctic shipping or operations over large ocean areas in near-real time. In this work, we investigated the feasibility of automatic iceberg detection in Sentinel-1 Extra Wide Swath (EWS) SAR images which follow the preferred image mode in operational ice charting. As test region, we selected the Barents Sea where the size of many icebergs is on the order of the spatial resolution of the EWS-mode. We tested a new approach for a detection scheme. It is based on a combination of a filter for enhancing the contrast between icebergs and background, subsequent blob detection, and final application of a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm. The filter relies mainly on the HV-polarized intensity which often reveals a larger difference between icebergs and sea ice or open water. The blob detector identifies locations of potential icebergs and thus shortens computation time. The final detection is performed on the identified blobs using the CFAR algorithm. About 2000 icebergs captured in fast ice were visually identified in Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Imager (MSI) data and exploited for an assessment of the detection scheme performance using confusion matrices. For our performance tests, we used four Sentinel-1 EWS images. For judging the effect of spatial resolution, we carried out an additional test with one Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide Swath (IWS) mode image. Our results show that only 8-22 percent of the icebergs could be detected in the EWS images, and over 90 percent of all detections were false alarms. In IWS mode, the number of correctly identified icebergs increased to 38 percent. However, we obtained a larger number of false alarms in the IWS image than in the corresponding EWS image. We identified two problems for iceberg detection: 1) with the given frequency-polarization combination, not all icebergs are strong scatterers at HV-polarization, and (2) icebergs and deformation structures present on fast ice can often not be distinguished since both may reveal equally strong responses at HV-polarization.

TI  - Sedimentary Environment of a Modern Carbonate Platform of Karimunjawa Islands, Central Java
T2  - INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sitting in a biodiversity "hotspot" of the mid-Sunda Shelf region, Karimunjawa Islands have currently been the priority for marine biodiversity conservation. Knowledge of surface sediments on modern carbonate platform is one of essential information to support conservation policies, but such has received little attention from reef researchers. This study describes the sediment characteristics of the selected modern carbonate platforms of Karimunjawa Islands through integrated sediments and satellite data analysis. Textural group of sediments indicates that moderate to poorly sorted gravelly sands are dominant with no grading pattern concerning geomorphological and habitat succession from landward to seaward. Sediment compositions are predominantly bioclastic components, comprising coral and mollusks as the highest and the second highest estimated order of abundance. The reworked grains and rock fragments, although present, are not volumentary abundant. The carbonate sedimentary facies is primarily composed of mud-lean packstone with additional proportion of grainstone and packstone. There are only slight distinct sedimentological characteristics for all benthic habitats as shown by the principal component analysis revealing overlap relationship between sediment parameters and benthic habitats. The study provides the first characterization of sediments which operate on the modern carbonate platform of Karimunjawa Islands along with their controlling factors and specialized nature.

TI  - Dust Aerosol Detection by the Modified CO<sub>2</sub> Slicing Method
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust aerosols, which have diverse and strong influences on the environment, must be monitored. Satellite data are effective for monitoring atmospheric conditions globally. In this work, the modified CO2 slicing method, a cloud detection technique using thermal infrared data from space, was applied to GOSAT data to detect the dust aerosol layer height. The results were compared using lidar measurements. Comparison of horizontal distributions found for northern Africa during summer revealed that both the relative frequencies of the low level aerosol layer from the slicing method and the dust frequencies of CALIPSO are high in northern coastal areas. Comparisons of detected layer top heights using collocated data with CALIPSO and ground-based lidar consistently showed high detection frequencies of the lower level aerosol layer, although the slicing method sometimes produces overestimates. This tendency is significant over land. The main causes of this tendency might be uncertainty of the surface skin temperature and a temperature inversion layer in the atmosphere. The results revealed that obtaining the detailed behavior of dust aerosols using the modified slicing method alone is difficult.

TI  - A Classification Method Based on the Visible Spectrum for Burned and Unburned Gangue Distinguishment
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - A large number of coal mines are widely distributed over China. Bulk coal gangue deposits seriously affect the mining area environment, and some mishandling of coal gangue may cause spontaneous combustion and explosion, which poses a direct threat to mine safety. The comprehensive utilization of coal gangue can effectively alleviate this problem, and it is of significance to the ecological safety and sustainable development of mine. Depending on the burning state, coal gangue is divided into two types - burned and unburned gangue, whose hidden dangers of security and harm to the environment are different, as well as ways of comprehensive utilization. Therefore, it is very important to do the classification, recognition and monitoring of the coal gangue. The current monitoring methods are mainly the field investigation with low efficiency and high cost, almost impossible for meeting the actual demand of coal gangue monitoring. Tiefa mine in Liaoning Province was chosen as the study area. Firstly, a total of 106 typical coal gangue samples were collected from waste dump in mining areas. Then, SVC HR1024 spectrometer was used to test the visible and near infrared spectrum of samples, and a differential spectral index NDGI was constructed to identify the burned and unburned gangue based on the difference of spectral characteristics of the burned and unburned gangue. Finally, the laboratory spectral data and the corresponding satellite remote sensing images were utilized for verifying the index. The random forest classification method was used as a contrast to the results of the laboratory spectrum treatment. The results showed that the slope of the spectral curves of burned gangue samples was higher ranging from 350 to 750 nm, and the reflectance within range of 550 similar to 630 nm increased sharply, while the slope of the unburned gangue in the whole visible bands of spectrum was lower. The threshold of the NDGI index was set as 0. 25 to distinguish the burned and unburned gangue. The laboratory spectral data showed that the classification accuracy of the NDGI index is up to 99. 1%, higher than that of 95. 2% of the random forest classification method. The Field results showed burned and unburned areas of waste dump were distinguished and classified in Landsat8 OLI images based on the NDGI index, and the burned and unburned coal gangue areas were in good agreement with the Google Earth on the morphology and size. The overall results showed that the index can effectively distinguish the combustion states of gangue. In addition, burned and unburned gangue samples were taken for mineral identification respectively. By comparing the changes of mineral species before and after combustion, the cause of spectral difference was analyzed between the burned and unburned gangue. The results showed the oxidation from Fe(2+)to Fe (3+) of gangue in the process of combustion. A large increase in Fe3+ caused the formation of an obvious spectral valley characteristic at 550 nm band, and a highly reflectance appeared at 750 nm band due to the glass quality generated during combustion. The above conditions cause differences in NDGI index between the burned and unburned gangue. In this paper, the results provide a fast, efficient and accurate model and method for burned and unburned gangue distinguishment in coal mine.

M3  - Article
AB  - We report here on the diversity and composition of Coreidae and Pentatomidae species, as well as their egg parasitoids collected on cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L.] Walp) (Fabaceae) plants from a field in Teresina, central-northern Piaui State, Brazil. Weekly sweep net sampling was performed during the phenological cycle of this crop in the rainy and dry seasons. In the pentatomid collections, 14 species were identified from 3 subfamilies (Asopinae, Edessinae, and Pentatominae). Five species of Coreidae also were collected from the subfamily Coreinae. We found that Euschistus heros (F.), Crinocerus sanctus (F.), Chinovio ubica (Rolston), and Piezodorus guildinii (Westwood) (all Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) were the most abundant hemipteran species associated with cowpea. Generally, species richness and diversity of individuals from this order were higher in the rainy season than in the dry season. The parasitoid species identified from field-collected hemipteran egg masses were: Anastatus coreophagus Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae), Neorileya flavipes Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae), Ooencyrtus anasae (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), O. submetallicus (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), and Trissolcus urichi (Crawford) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae). We found that about 52% of hemipteran egg masses collected from the cowpea field were naturally parasitized by the above parasitoids, whereas nearly 10% of C. sanctus and C. ubico sentinel egg masses were parasitized.

TI  - Femtosecond Laser Filaments for Use in Sub-Diffraction-Limited Imaging and Remote Sensing
T2  - JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Probing remote matter with laser light is a ubiquitous technique used in circumstances as diverse as laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy and barcode scanners. In classical optics, the intensity that can be brought to bear on a remote target is limited by the spot size of the laser at the distance of the target. This spot size has a lower bound determined by the diffraction limit of classical optics. However, amplified femtosecond laser pulses generate intensity sufficient to modify the refractive index of the ambient air and undergo self-focusing. This self-focusing effect leads to the generation of highly intense laser filaments which maintain their intensity and small sub-millimeter diameter size at distances well beyond the classical Rayleigh length. Such intensity provides the capability of remote scanning, imaging, sensing, and spectroscopy with enhanced spatial resolution. We describe a technique for generating filaments with a femtosecond regenerative chirped-pulse amplifier, and for using the resulting filament to conduct imaging and spectroscopic measurements at remote distances of at least several meters.

TI  - Can Anastatus bifasciatus Be Used for Augmentative Biological Control of the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug in Fruit Orchards?
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The generalist egg parasitoid Anastatus bifasciatus (Geoffroy) (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae) is the most prevalent egg parasitoid of the invasive Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in Europe. To assess its efficacy against the pest H. halys and to validate the potential risks for non-target species in a realistic field setting, inundative releases were conducted over three consecutive years in four fruit orchards in Switzerland and Italy. In total, more than 4300 A. bifasciatus females were released, which was equivalent to 11,000 to 26,000 females per hectare, depending on distances between trees in each orchard. Parasitism of freeze-killed sentinel H. halys eggs achieved with the current release strategy was on average 6% (range: 2%-16%) and considered not high enough to effectively suppress the pest. However, the overall impact of A. bifasciatus on the mortality of H. halys eggs was likely underestimated. If pre-imaginal parasitoid mortality (3.3%) and host feeding (6%) are added to the observed parasitism (6%), the actual induced mortality of H. halys eggs may reach more than 15%. Parasitism of lepidopteran non-target species reached an average of 8% and thus, some degree of non-target parasitism after mass releases may be expected. To quantify the impact of the parasitoids in the orchards more precisely, naturally laid egg masses should be used in future trials to include host-finding cues of the host and host plants, and larger scale releases with potentially higher densities of parasitoids should be considered.

The objective of this study was to describe reports of URFOs, including the types of objects, anatomic locations, contributing factors, and harm, in order to make recommendations to improve perioperative safety.Methods: A retrospective review was undertaken of events involving URFOs reported to The Joint Commission from October 2012 through March 2018. Inclusion criteria were events meeting Joint Commission definitions of URFO and sen-tinel event. Exclusion criteria were sponges used intraoperatively and guidewires. Event reports included patients undergoing surgery, child birth, wound care, and other invasive procedures.Results: A total of 308 events involving URFOs were reported: instruments (102), catheters and drains (52), needles and blades (33), packing (30), implants (14), specimens (6), and other items (71). Many of the instruments were used in minimally invasive or orthopedic surgery. Items were most frequently retained in the abdomen or the vagina. Most URFOs occurred in the operating room. A total of 1,156 contributing factors were identified, most frequently in the categories human factors, leadership, and communication. In the majority of reports, the harm was categorized as unexpected additional care/extended stay. Five patients died as a result of the URFO.Conclusion: We describe events involving URFOs voluntarily reported to The Joint Commission. The variety of retained items, the departments involved, and the large number of contributing factors demonstrate the complexity of patient care and the need for a multifaceted plan for prevention. We make recommendations based on these findings.

TI  - Natural killer cells limit the clearance of senescent lung adenocarcinoma cells
T2  - ONCOGENESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Senescence is an important p53-controlled tumor suppressor program that not only opposes the proliferation of cancer cells but also promotes their immune-mediated clearance in certain contexts. In hepatocellular cancer, p53 induction promotes an innate immune cell-mediated clearance of senescent cells wherein natural killer (NK) cells seem to play the primary sentinel role. Whether NK cells also surveil cancer cells in other tumor types when p53 is activated to promote a senescence response is unknown. To identify the role that NK and other innate immune cell types have on the surveillance and destruction of lung adenocarcinoma cells, we developed an orthotopic transplantation model where p53 gene function could be restored to induce senescence after successful engraftment of tumor cells in the mouse lung. Contrary to precedent, we found that NK cells actually limited the efficient clearance of tumor cells from the mouse lung after p53 restoration. Instead, activation of p53 induced the infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils, and interstitial macrophages. Loss of NK cells further promoted expansion of these inflammatory cell types and tumor clearance after p53 restoration. These observations suggest that NK cell responses to p53 activation in lung adenocarcinoma is distinct from those found in other tumor types and that diverse innate immune cell populations may play context-dependent roles during tumor immune surveillance. Further, our data provide an impetus to understand the broader mechanisms that regulate cancer cell destruction by multiple cell types of the innate immune system and distinct cancer contexts.

TI  - Seagrass Resource Assessment Using WorldView-2 Imagery in the Redfish Bay, Texas
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass meadows play important roles as habitats for many marine organisms, traps for sediment, and buffers against wave actions. The objective of this paper is to map seagrass meadows in the Redfish Bay, Texas from WorldView-2 imagery. Seagrass meadows grow in shallow and clear water areas in the Redfish Bay. The WorldView-2 satellite can acquire multispectral imagery from the bay bottom with 2 m spatial resolution 8 multispectral bands and 0.46 m panchromatic imagery. The top of atmosphere radiance was transformed to the bottom reflectance through the atmospheric correction and the water column correction. The object based image analysis was used to identify seagrass meadows distributions in the Redfish Bay. This investigation demonstrated that seagrass can be identified with 94% accuracy, although seagrass species cannot be satisfactorily recognized. The results implied that the WorldView-2 satellite imagery is a suitable data source for seagrass distribution mapping.

TI  - BROADBAND LEO SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS: ARCHITECTURES AND KEY TECHNOLOGIES
T2  - IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview for key issues in broadband LEO satellite communication systems. First of all, the network architecture is introduced, which is the basis of the whole system. The space-based LEO system with ISL, which requires a small number of ground gateways, is the focus. In this system, the satellite constellation design is important with impact on key system performances such as coverage. Two popular LEO constellations, the walker Delta and Star constellations, are introduced. Given satellite constellations, proper beam coverage schemes should be employed at satellites to provide seamless coverage all over the world. A hybrid wide and spot beam coverage scheme is presented, where the LEO provides a wide beam for large area coverage and several steering spot beams for highspeed data access. Moreover, special coverage schemes should be designed in broadband LEO systems for the interference coordination between LEO and GEO. To protect GEO communications, LEO satellites should be turned off if they cause interference to GEO. In this case, to provide services for users covered by the turned-off LEO satellites, a progressive pitch method and a coverage expanding method can be employed. Finally, the coverage performance of LEO is also closely related to resource management schemes. The global resource management for broadband LEO systems is complicated, involving a large amount of data, and a two-level management structure should be employed. Using this structure, an NMC with powerful storage and processing capabilities is employed to carry out the first-level management, making strategies based on all information collected from the whole system. Then satellite base stations with limited capabilities are employed to respond to the strategies generated by NMC in real time.

TI  - SEASONAL DNA METHYLATION VARIATION IN THE FLAT TREE OYSTER <i>ISOGNOMON ALATUS</i> FROM A MANGROVE ECOSYSTEM IN NORTH BISCAYNE BAY, FLORIDA
T2  - JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Epigenetic analyses constitute an emerging approach for better understanding of the mechanisms underlying environmental responses and their role during acclimatization and adaptation across diverse ecosystems. The expansion of environmental epigenetic studies to a broader range of ecologically and environmentally relevant organisms will enhance the capability to forecast ecological and evolutionary processes, as well as to facilitate a retrospective assessment of stress exposures in biomonitor organisms through "epigenetic footprinting" analyses. With such purpose, the present study monitored spatial and temporal variation in abiotic parameters (temperature, salinity, pH, and horizontal visibility) over a 2-y period in a mangrove ecosystem located in North Biscayne Bay (North Miami, FL). The obtained data were subsequently compared with epigenetic modifications (global genome-wide DNA methylation levels) in the flat tree oyster Isognomon alarus, used as a sentinel model organism across experimental sites. The obtained results revealed a certain level of seasonality in temporal DNA methylation patterns, which seem to be primarily associated with changes in temperature and horizontal visibility. These results constitute the first long-term study combining spatial and temporal epigenetic analyses in a marine organism in its natural environment, laying the initial groundwork to assess the biomonitoring potential of environmental epigenetic analyses.

TI  - Marcus Aurelius and the Ancient Philosophical Ideas in Victor Pelevin's Novel <i>The Life of Insects</i>
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the philosophical aspect of Victor Pelevin's novel The Life of Insects, which embraces the system of characters, individual collisions and spatial images, as well as the development of the author's philosophical themes. From the position of comparative philosophy, the author turns to the literary study of a number of contemporary worldview problems.To verify their validity, these problems are considered in the context of two philosophical discourses: ancient and eastern. The ideas of the classical philosophy of antiquity and Marcus Aurelius are connected in the novel with the images of two fireflies or moths Mitya and Dima. These characters represent different manifestations of the same consciousness. Mitya is immersed in existence, Dima manifests the future state of Mitya's consciousness.Their relationship is organized as a relationship between a student and a mentor, which refers us to the ancient issue of self-education, impossible without the authoritative Other. By manifesting a philosophizing consciousness, these two characters are contrasted with the other characters of the novel. The philosophical dialogues of these characters are given in the context of the ideas of ancient philosophy and Marcus Aurelius. They address the problems of ontology, anthropology, gnoseology, ethics.In the plot of the novel, the process of self-determination is embodied: Mitya makes his existential choice between light and darkness, between true and false modes of existence, reveals a solution to the problem of the freedom of choice and will. After initiation, he creates his own poetic text "In Memory of Marcus Aurelius". The text of the poem appears as an act of the metaphysical will of a free man of an intelligible world, and rationality in the novel serves as the basis for bringing together the philosophical ideas of antiquity and of I. Kant.The collision of cognition and self-cognition is completed in the novel by the disappearance of Dima and the transformation of the divided consciousness into one: the character acquires the full name of Dmitry.The legacy of Marcus Aurelius and the philosophical ideas of antiquity turned out to be necessary for Pelevin to study the possibility of an existential breakthrough of an individual person to the truth under the conditions of modern mass civilization. The leading role in the comparison and dialogue of various philosophical discourses (ancient and eastern) belongs to the ancient one, in the center of which is Reflections by M. Aurelius.The actualization of the loss of the center, the relativism of this discourse in a postclassical situation indicates a return to antiquity in the search for ethical pillars in a supportfree world. However, admitting the possibility of individual enlightenment, the general concept of the novel implies the author's pessimism and skepticism in assessing the capabilities of humanity (the entomological aspect of the novel) since there is no common good, no rationality; life is irrational, and the individual truth acquired by the hero does not change the general state of the world.

TI  - Identification of microRNA expression in sentinel lymph nodes from patients with breast cancer via RNA sequencing for diagnostic accuracy
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node (SLN) property assessment (with or without metastasis) is important when deciding the surgery for breast cancer; however, the current diagnosis of SLN metastasis remains to be studied. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been confirmed previously as a molecular marker for the diagnosis, development and prognosis of tumors. However, the detailed role of miRNAs in the diagnosis of SLN metastasis has not been reported. Methods The present study aimed to explore the potential use of miRNAs in the diagnosis of SLN using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to compare the expression profiles of miRNAs in patients with breast cancer with or without SLN metastasis. Results The RNA-seq results revealed that 1993 miRNAs were differentially expressed in patients with breast cancer with SLN metastasis. Among these miRNAs, 1960 were up-regulated and 33 were down-regulated. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses revealed that these differentially expressed miRNAs were associated with tumor growth and metastasis and were also predicted to regulate a series of tumorigenesis and metastasis genes. In particular, the most differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR, such that miR-200a-3p and miR-96-5p were up-regulated and miR-1-3p and miR-486-3p were down-regulated in patients with breast cancer with SLN metastasis. Conclusions The findings of the present study suggest that there is an association of miRNAs with SLN metastasis and also that miRNAs function as biomarkers with respect to the choice of therapy and disease prognosis.

TI  - Remote Sensing Estimation of Sea Surface Salinity from GOCI Measurements in the Southern Yellow Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about the spatiotemporal distribution of sea surface salinity (SSS) provides valuable and important information for understanding various marine biogeochemical processes and ecosystems, especially for those coastal waters significantly affected by human activities. Remote-sensing techniques have been used to monitor salinity in the open ocean with their advantages of wide-area surveys and real-time monitoring. However, potential challenges remain when using satellite data with coarse spatiotemporal resolutions, leading to a loss of valuable information. In the current study, based on the local dataset collected over the southern Yellow Sea (SYS), a region-customized algorithm was developed to estimate SSS by using the remote sensing reflectance. The model evaluations indicated that our algorithm yielded good SSS estimation, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.29 psu and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.75%. Satellite-derived SSS results compared well with those derived from in situ observations, further suggesting the good performance of our developed algorithm for the study regions. We applied this algorithm to Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data for the month of August from 2011 to 2018 in the SYS, and produced the spatial distribution patterns of the SSS for August of each year. The SSS values were high in offshore waters and lower in coastal waters, especially in the Yangtze River estuary. The negative correlation between the monthly Changjiang River discharge (CRD) and SSS (R = -0.71, p < 0.001) near the Yangtze River estuary was observed, suggesting that the SSS distribution in the Yangtze River estuary was potentially influenced by the CRD. In offshore waters, the correlation between SSS and CRD was weak (R < 0.2), suggesting that the riverine discharge's effect might be weak.

TI  - Variation in MERRA-2 aerosol optical depth over the Yangtze River Delta from 1980 to 2016
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, 765 instantaneous MERRA-2 (second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications) aerosol optical depth (AOD) values at 550nm were compared with those of a sky radiometer in Hefei (31.90 degrees N, 117.17 degrees E) for the different seasons from March 2007 to February 2010. The correlation coefficients (R) were 0.88, 0.83, 0.88, and 0.80 in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. The MERRA-2 AOD is also compared with MODIS Aqua AOD in the entire Yangtze River Delta, and good agreement has been obtained. The MERRA-2 AOD product was used to analyze the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the annual, seasonal and monthly means of the AOD over the Yangtze River Delta region from 1980 to 2016 (37years). The mean values of the MERRA-2 AOD during the study period show that the AOD (between 0.45 and 0.55) in the northern area of the Yangtze River Delta was higher than that (between 0.30 and 0.45) of the southern area. The northwest part of the Yangtze River Delta had the highest mean AOD values (between 0.50 and 0.55). The AOD increased slowly in the 1980s and 1990s, followed by a rapid increase between 2001 and 2010. An AOD decrease can be seen from 2011 to 2016. The mean AOD in each month is discussed. High AOD was observed in March, April, and June, while low AOD could be seen in September, October, November, and December. Three different area types (large cities, medium-sized cities, and remote areas) had nearly the same annual AOD variation. Large cities had the highest AOD (about 0.48), while remote areas had the lowest (about 0.42). In summer, the AOD in remote areas was much lower than that in cities. The AOD variational trend over the Yangtze River Delta was studied during two periods. The increasing trend could be seen over the entire Yangtze River Delta in each month from 1980 to 2009. A decreasing trend was found all over the Yangtze River Delta in January, February, March, July, October, and November, whereas in other months, some parts witnessed increasing AOD while others saw a decreasing trend between 2010 and 2016.

TI  - Refined Typhoon Geometric Center Derived From a High Spatiotemporal Resolution Geostationary Satellite Imaging System
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen-4 (GF-4) and Himawari-8 (H8) imagery data were utilized to demonstrate and validate the impact of enhanced spatiotemporal imaging resolution when tracking Super Typhoon Nepartak (2016). The GF-4 remote sensing satellite is the China's first civilian high-resolution geostationary optical satellite, which has been launched at the end of December 2015. A classical TV-L1 optical flow (OF) algorithm and H8 cloud-top products were also presented to derive cloud-tracking motions, rotating centers, and geometric centers of Super Typhoon Nepartak to investigate the inner-core dynamics and structures of the typhoon. The typhoon positions of the rotating centers derived from the lowest velocities using GF-4 showed good agreement with centers derived using the H8 cloud-top pressure and height threshold-based method. The OF method failed to retrieve the typhoon center using H8 imagery data due to the relatively coarse spatiotemporal resolution. Conversely, refined features and shifts in the track of Typhoon Nepartak were apparent in the GF-4 imagery data as compared to H8. These findings illustrate the significant impact of a satellite imaging system with a higher spatiotemporal resolution when investigating the dynamics features of typhoon.

TI  - Microwave and Meteorological Fusion: A method of Spatial Downscaling of Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Downscaling of microwave remotely sensed that soil moisture content (SMC) is an efficient way to obtain spatial continuous SMC at a finer resolution. However, the classical optical/thermal and microwave fusion, and the active and passive microwave fusion cannot work under all-weather conditions because of contamination of clouds or the lack of suitable radar data source. In this study, a microwave and meteorological fusion (MMF) is provided. The MMF method is based on a complementary relationship hypothesis assuming SMC is reflected in the adjacent surface atmospheric moisture under midday conditions. By this method, daily passive SMC products from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission with 36-km resolution were disaggregated using a daily gridded meteorological data with nominal 4-km resolution. The original and downscaled SMCs were evaluated by comparing with in situ SMC obtained from three core validation sites and three sparse networks. The experiment was conducted in the central part of the U.S. from April 2015 to June 2018. Results demonstrated that the downscaled SMC maintained the dynamic range of original SMC product and energy was conserved. Furthermore, the downscaled SMC showed good agreement with and slightly outperformed the original SMC as compared with in situ SMC. The downscaling method is shown to capture higher resolution SMC spatial variability while preserving the quality of original SMC. However, because of the complexity of soil moisture-atmosphere interactions, the actual contributing domain of downscaled SMC may be greater than 4 km. The MMF method is suggested as a supplementary for all-weather downscaling coarse-resolution SMC.

TI  - Improving Estimation of Cropland Evapotranspiration by the Bayesian Model Averaging Method with Surface Energy Balance Models
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the key components of the global hydrological cycle. Many models have been established to obtain an accurate estimation of ET, but the uncertainty of each model has not been satisfactorily addressed, and the weight determination in multi-model simulation methods remains unclear. In this study, the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method was adopted to tackle this issue. We explored the combination of four surface energy balance (SEB) models (SEBAL, SSEB, S-SEBI and SEBS) with the BMA method by using Landsat 8 images over two study areas in China, the Huailai flux station (semiarid region) and the Sidaoqiao flux station (arid/semiarid region), and the data from two stations were used as validation for this method. The performances of SEB models and different BMA methods is revealed by three statistical parameters (i.e., the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE)). We found the best performing SEB model was SEBAL, with an R-2 of 0.609 (0.672), RMSE of 1.345 (0.876) mm/day, and NSE of 0.407 (0.563) at Huailai (Sidaoqiao) station. Compared with the four individual SEB models, each of the BMA methods (fixed, posterior inclusion probability, or random) can provide a more accurate and reliable simulation result. Similarly, in Huailai (Sidaoqiao) station, the best performing BMA random model provided an R-2 of 0.750 (0.796), RMSE of 0.902 (0.602) mm/day, and NSE of 0.746 (0.793). We conclude that the BMA method outperformed the four SEB models alone and obtained a more accurate prediction of ET in two cropland areas, which provides important guidance for water resource allocation and management in arid and semiarid regions.

TI  - High-Resolution Urban Land Mapping in China from Sentinel 1A/2 Imagery Based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely urban land mapping is fundamental to supporting large area environmental and socio-economic research. Most of the available large-area urban land products are limited to a spatial resolution of 30 m. The fusion of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for large-area high-resolution urban land mapping has not yet been widely explored. In this study, we propose a fast and effective urban land extraction method using ascending/descending orbits of Sentinel-1A SAR data and Sentinel-2 MSI (MultiSpectral Instrument, Level 1C) optical data acquired from 1 January 2015 to 30 June 2016. Potential urban land (PUL) was identified first through logical operations on yearly mean and standard deviation composites from a time series of ascending/descending orbits of SAR data. A Yearly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maximum and modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) mean composite were generated from Sentinel-2 imagery. The slope image derived from SRTM DEM data was used to mask mountain pixels and reduce the false positives in SAR data over these regions. We applied a region-specific threshold on PUL to extract the target urban land (TUL) and a global threshold on the MNDWI mean, and slope image to extract water bodies and high-slope regions. A majority filter with a three by three window was applied on previously extracted results and the main processing was carried out on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. China was chosen as the testing region to validate the accuracy and robustness of our proposed method through 224,000 validation points randomly selected from high-resolution Google Earth imagery. Additionally, a total of 735 blocks with a size of 900 x 900 m were randomly selected and used to compare our product's accuracy with the global human settlement layer (GHSL, 2014), GlobeLand30 (2010), and Liu (2015) products. Our method demonstrated the effectiveness of using a fusion of optical and SAR data for large area urban land extraction especially in areas where optical data fail to distinguish urban land from spectrally similar objects. Results show that the average overall, producer's and user's accuracies are 88.03%, 94.50% and 82.22%, respectively.

AB  - Since breast reconstruction has been covered by health insurance, we can choose a procedure that combines the cosmetic satisfaction of patients with curability. We report about a patient with breast cancer that who underwent nipple-sparing mastectomy after evaluating the intraductal spread by automated breast ultrasound system(ABUS), while hand held ultrasound( HHUS)showed only limited information on the intraductal spread of the lesion. A 52-year old woman with an abnormal screening finding was referred to our hospital. HHUS showed an irregular and poorly defined hypoechoic mass lesion with a lactiferous duct extending to directly under the nipple. A core needle biopsy revealed invasive ductal carcinoma. We performed ABUS to assess the intraductal spread in the lesion because the patient requested breast reconstruction. The coronal section of the breast in the ABUS did not showintraductal spread. We, therefore, decided to perform a nipple-sparing mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Intraoperative evaluation by frozen and permanent sections showed negative margins. The ABUS findings helped in the evaluation of the intraductal spread of the lesion and in the choice of the optimal procedure for the patient.

TI  - Near real-time monitoring of tropical forest disturbance: New algorithms and assessment framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Near real-time monitoring systems of forest disturbance are essential to reduce illegal logging and global deforestation, but the assessment of their performance varies greatly and rarely adheres to recommended assessment practices. Current assessment protocols recommended in the published literature focus on sample-based estimation of area and accuracy of features in remote sensing-based maps, which is less relevant for assessing the performance of near real-time monitoring systems. Rather than area bias and accuracy of mapped features, the objective of near real-time monitoring is fast detection of forest disturbance events. Here we present a new assessment framework as well as two new algorithms for near real-time monitoring of tropical forest disturbance. The first algorithm (NRT-CCDC) fits time series models based on MODIS data to predict future observations. Detections of forest disturbance are labeled as "low-probability", "high-probability", and "confirmed" based on the number of consecutive observations that deviate substantially from the prediction. The second algorithm (Fusion2) predicts MODIS observations at a high temporal frequency by building a model based on a time series of Landsat observations. Fusion2 utilizes daily MODIS observations from both Terra and Aqua to achieve rapid detection of disturbance events. A framework for assessing the performance of near real-time monitoring is presented that focuses on the timing and minimum detectable size of forest disturbance events while still being based on probability sampling and design-based inference. Central to the framework is a new metric we refer to as the "alert-lag relationship", which characterizes the frequency of omitted disturbance events as a function of the time lag between the dates of disturbance and detection. When applied to three different near-real monitoring systems representing three levels of operational readiness (Fusion2, NRT-CCDC and Terra-i), we found that Fusion2 achieved an alert accuracy (event-based agreement) of 50% after 82 days and NRT-CCDC achieved 50% after 126 days. Terra-i never achieved an alert accuracy of 50% but achieved 30% after 109 days. In terms of event size, all three systems showed better performance in detecting large events compared to small events. The smallest event detected by the three systems was 6.5 ha. Conventional accuracy assessment (pixel-based agreement) showed that the user's accuracy, which characterizes commission errors, of the disturbance class for Fusion2, NRT-CCDC, and Terra-i were 87%, 79%, and 30% respectively. The two more complex systems, Fusion2 and NRT-CCDC were consistently more accurate than the operational Terra-i system. In general, the higher the cost of implementing the system corresponded to a higher accuracy of the detection system. A primary objective moving forward is to make the NRT-CCDC and Fusion2 more operational over larger areas.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: Southeast US (SE US).Study focus: This study probes the propagation of errors in standard remote-sensing vegetation products caused by cloud contamination and the impact of time-variant radiative properties for correctly describing land-surface properties in hydrologic models. Spatiotemporally-varying quality-controlled vegetation attributes (i.e., leaf area index and fractional vegetation coverage) and surface radiative properties (i.e., longwave broadband emissivity and shortwave broadband albedo) were derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products over the SE US at 1 km x 1 km and hourly resolutions from 2007 to 2013. The data sets are publicly available. The impact of uncorrected standard vegetation products and static treatments of radiative properties was assessed systematically clearly illustrating improvements in simulated water and energy fluxes using the developed landscape attributes with a fully-distributed uncalibrated hydrologic model.New hydrological insights for the region: Through simulations in the Southern Appalachian Mountains, we found that the spatiotemporal variability of radiative properties significantly influences the diurnal cycle of the surface energy budget with marked differences in sensible heat fluxes (up to 10-20%). Better performance of streamflow simulations achieved by using the improved vegetation attributes is tied to changes in rainfall interception and evapotranspiration, reflecting the importance of SE forests in the regional water cycle. The largest improvements in streamflow simulations result from larger corrections to MODIS products in the inner mountain region where cloudiness is persistent.

TI  - Swimming Pool Electrical Injuries Steps Toward Prevention
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Electrical injuries in swimming pools are an important pediatric public health concern. We sought to (1) improve our understanding of the clinical presentation and outcomes following and (2) describe the epidemiology of swimming pool electrical injuries in the United States. Methods We reviewed 4 cases of pediatric (<18 y old) electrical injury from a single, urban level 1 pediatric trauma center. We also queried the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) for emergency department visits due to electrical injury associated with swimming pools, occurring between 1991 and 2013. Results Overall, 566 cases were reported, with a mean (SD) age of 9.2 (4.1) years. Patients were mostly treated and released from the emergency department (91.8%), whereas 8.2% were hospitalized. When stated, injuries occurred most frequently at home (57.0%), followed by public (23.9%) and sports facilities (19.1%). Electrical outlets or receptacles (39.8%) were most commonly implicated, followed by electrical system doors (18.2%), electric wiring systems (17.0%), thermostats (16.3%), hair dryers (4.6%), and radios (4.1%). Pediatric cases represented 48.4% of swimming pool-related electrical injuries reported to NEISS. Conclusions Electrical injuries occurring in and around swimming pools remain an important source of morbidity and mortality. Although NEISS monitors sentinel events, current efforts at preventing such cases are less than adequate. All electrical outlets near swimming pools should be properly wired with ground fault circuit interrupter devices. Possible approaches to increasing safe electrical device installation are through strengthening public awareness and education of the potential for injury, as well as changes to current inspection regulations.

AB  - Evapotranspiration is a key parameter in agricultural water planning and management strategies because it determines the crop and irrigation water requirements. With the recent advance in satellite-based field observations and meteorological modeling, several techniques have been developed and applied to estimate actual evapotranspiration. This paper presents the first results of the application to field evapotranspiration monitoring of land surface temperatures observed by Japan's new Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C) satellite. Through a test application conducted in an irrigation region in the western USA, specifications of the GCOM-C surface temperature observation and the derived field evapotranspiration were evaluated. The specifications of the surface temperature observation were that the satellite observed the study fields with a spatial resolution of about 300m at a frequency of 4-5days per week. Clouds further degraded observation frequency. However, at least one constant successful observation of land surface temperature was available each week during the study period from June 17 to July 21, 2018. With the unique spatial and temporal resolution of GCOM-C, the surface temperature data allowed weekly monitoring of individual field evapotranspiration for large-size fields. Estimation results of field evapotranspiration by the GCOM-C ETindex estimation algorithm were evaluated for fields of wheat, pea, alfalfa, bean, and corn/potato/beet, as well as for rangeland. The result reasonably explained the relative differences of evapotranspiration among the different crop types and among individual fields having the same crop type. Quantitatively, some indications of underestimation of evapotranspiration were found during the application.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) method is used together with field observations to determine whether surface deformations occur in the region after the 5,5 Mw (AFAD) Samsat Earthquake occurred at a distance of 2.5 km from the Samsat district of Adiyaman province on 2 March 2017. We attempted to determine the deformation of the interferogram created by analyzing two Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of the Sentinel-1A fit before and after the earthquake. As a result of the evaluation of the interferogram, a surface deformation of about 2.5 cm in the satellite view direction/Line of Sight (LoS) was observed in the region. This deformation is mostly concentrated in the northeast of Samsat town. As a result of the detailed field investigations made immediately after the earthquake in the region, no surface rupture occurred but surface deformations in the form of local and discontinous fissures developed in some areas. It is understood that the Earthquake developed on a fault passing through about 5 Km North of Samsat and named as Samsat Fault by TPAO. It appears that more than 400 aftershocks following the main shock in the region concentrate roughly on a N40-50W lineament. It is noteworthy that in the observations made in the field, the distribution of the damage has also developed along this line in particular.

TI  - Cross-Comparison between MODIS and VIIRS Snow Cover Products for the 2016 Hydrological Year
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) instrument on board the Suomi-NPP (National Polar-Orbiting Partnership) satellite aims to provide long-term continuity of several environmental data series including snow cover initiated with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). Although it is speculated that MODIS and VIIRS snow cover products may differ because of their differing spatial resolutions and spectral coverage, quantitative comparisons between their snow products are currently limited. Therefore, this study intercompares MODIS and VIIRS snow products for the 2016 Hydrological Year over the Midwestern United States and southern Canada. Two hundred and forty-four swath snow products from MODIS/Aqua (MYD10L2) and the VIIRS EDR (Environmental Data Records) (VSCMO/binary) were intercompared using confusion matrices, comparison maps and false color imagery. Thresholding the MODIS NDSI (Normalized Difference Snow Index) Snow Cover product at a snow cover fraction of 30% generated binary snow maps are most comparable to the NOAA VIIRS binary snow product. Overall agreement between MODIS and VIIRS was found to be approximately 98%. This exceeds the VIIRS accuracy requirements of 90% probability of correct typing. The agreement was highest during the winter but lower during late fall and spring. MODIS and VIIRS often mapped snow/no-snow transition zones as a cloud. The assessment of total snow and cloud pixels and comparison snow maps of MODIS and VIIRS indicate that VIIRS is mapping more snow cover and less cloud cover compared to MODIS. This is evidenced by the average area of snow in MYD10L2 and VSCMO being 5.72% and 11.43%, no-snow 26.65% and 28.67% and cloud 65.02% and 59.91%, respectively. While VIIRS and MODIS have a similar capacity to map snow cover, VIIRS has the potential to map snow cover area more accurately, for the successful development of climate data records.

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of shifting cultivation in Manipur, Northeast India based on time-series satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The extent and dynamics in shifting cultivation (locally called `jhum') landscapes in North-East India (NEI) particularly in hilly areas of Manipur has not been studied in the past. This study is an attempt to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of shifting cultivation in Manipur, NEI using Landsat time-series from 1999 to 2017. Effort was also made to explore if any relationship exist between the extent of jhum and population density in the study areas. Based on secondary data, we hypothesized that with the increase in population there is an increase in the number of jhum plots while the size of the jhum plots decreases. The different cropping stage and abandoned jhum patch of each year's imagery were mapped and post-classified to determine the crop-fallow rotation cycle. The results revealed a decreasing trend in the jhum area over the past 19 years with a major part occupied by current jhum patches, covering 67.00% (1047.36 km(2)) and 70.47% (844.17 km(2)) of the total jhum area in Ukhrul and Chandel respectively. On an average, 44-55 km(2) of forest was annually slashed for shifting cultivation with jhum size ranging from 1 ha to 2 ha in Ukhrul and 5-7.5 ha in Chandel. During the study period, an average of 39.88% area in Ukhrul and 41.05% area in Chandel was under current jhum, from which 19.64% land was continued for 2nd year cropping in Ukhrul while 17.20% land was continued for 2nd year cropping in Chandel. It was also observed that 10-14 years jhum cycles were most prevalent in Ukhrul (69.3% of total jhum affected area) while 9-12 years jhum cycles were most prevalent in Chandel (53.07% of total affected jhum area). With the existing 2 years cropping period, it may be inferred that the most prevalent fallow periods in Ukhrul and Chandel are 8-12 years and 7-10 years respectively. Increase in population over the years have nevertheless not only resulted in the reduction of jhum field size and total jhum extent but also the number of jhum plots except for Kamjong and Kasom Khullen blocks in Ukhrul. These findings were in partial agreement with our hypothesis that increase in population decreases the jhum field size without significant increase in the number of jhum plots.

TI  - Mapping Winter Crops in China with Multi-Source Satellite Imagery and Phenology-Based Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate mapping of winter crop planting areas in China is important for food security assessment at a national level. Time-series of vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are widely used for crop mapping, as they can characterize the growth cycle of crops. However, with the moderate spatial resolution optical imagery acquired by Landsat and Sentinel-2, it is difficult to obtain complete time-series curves for vegetation indices due to the influence of the revisit cycle of the satellite and weather conditions. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method for compositing the multi-temporal NDVI, in order to map winter crop planting areas with the Landsat-7 and -8 and Sentinel-2 optical images. The algorithm composites the multi-temporal NDVI into three key values, according to two time-windowsa period of low NDVI values and a period of high NDVI valuesfor the winter crops. First, we identify the two time-windows, according to the time-series of the NDVI obtained from daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer observations. Second, the 30 m spatial resolution multi-temporal NDVI curve, derived from the Landsat-7 and -8 and Sentinel-2 optical images, is composited by selecting the maximal value in the high NDVI value period, and the minimal and median values in the low NDVI value period, using an algorithm of the Google Earth Engine. Third, a decision tree classification method is utilized to perform the winter crop classification at a pixel level. The results indicate that this method is effective for the large-scale mapping of winter crops. In the study area, the area of winter crops in 2018 was determined to be 207,641 km(2), with an overall accuracy of 96.22% and a kappa coefficient of 0.93. The method proposed in this paper is expected to contribute to the rapid and accurate mapping of winter crops in large-scale applications and analyses.

TI  - The relationship between soil emissivity and soil reflectance under the effects of soil water content
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant changes of surface emissivity have taken place in cities with the rapid urbanization. Surface emissivity influences the radiation budget and the surface energy balance, thereby influences city climate. It is an important parameter in retrieving surface temperature and has close relationship with city heat island effect. This paper attempts to explore the possibility of using soil moisture index (SMI) to estimate soil emissivity (SE). The advantage of using SMI over soil moisture (SM) is that SMI is easily obtained with remotely sensed data. Its advantage over soil reflectance (SR) is that SMI can reflect soil water condition better. On the basis of the careful measurements of the variations of SE and SR with SM for four soil samples, the following results were obtained: (1) Logarithmic function is better than linear function in describing the relationship between SE and SM/SMI; (2) Similar correlation coefficient (R-2) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between SMI and SE were obtained in comparison with that between SM and SE. Therefore, SMI can replace SM to estimate SE. (3) The index of Water Index SOIL (WISOIL) is the best in the estimation of SE. (4) SE in MODIS 29 waveband is the most sensitive to the change of SM in comparison with SE in the other MODIS thermal wavebands regardless of soil texture.

TI  - The wedge clam Donax trunculus as sentinel organism for Mediterranean coastal monitoring in a global change context
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Review
AB  - The wedge clam Donax trunculus is commonly used in environmental monitoring studies as sentinel species for the biomonitoring of sandy beaches in Mediterranean areas. Taking in account the combined effects of chemical stressors and global changes in marine organisms, research efforts in ecotoxicology should be up-to-date for a more relevant and integrative monitoring studies. In the same context, it is an actual need to select bioindicators able to reflect both global change effects and conventional/emergent stressors in marine ecosystems. D. trunculus indeed appears as appropriate integrative sentinel specie. Apart from being an easy to collect species, D. trunculus presents many advantages justifying its use in (eco)toxicological studies such as large distribution, bioaccumulation capacity, responses (biomarkers) to contaminants and well studied biology, physiology and ecology. Herein, we propose a review based on a literature survey of (eco)toxicological aspects of D. trunculus with a special focus on the suitability of its use as a sentinel species in laboratory/ field studies and as potential indicator for regional and global changes. We recommend its further use in the environmental impact assessment of emerging contaminants (such as pharmaceuticals, micro and nanoplastics). Recommendations for an integrative environmental monitoring in a global change context are also highlighted.

TI  - Pixel-Based Classification of SAR Images Using Feature Attribute Profiles
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Attribute profiles (APs) are among the most prominent spectral-spatial pixel description tools, widely employed with optical, and hyperspectral images in particular. Their use, however, with the SAR data has been very limited. In this letter, we investigate the use of the recently developed feature attribute profiles (FPs) for the pixel-based classification of SAR images. Compared to low-level features such as intensity and amplitude, FPs are shown to provide high-level features incorporating successfully the spatial information of the pixels. Based on the classification results obtained on real TerraSAR-X images, it is shown that the FPs are capable of more accurately classifying the pixels compared to conventional and widely used SAR feature extraction methods such as gray-level co-occurrence matrices, histograms of oriented gradients, local binary patterns, and Gabor filters.

TI  - Comprehensive evaluation of Pleiades-1A bundle images for geospatial applications
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of comprehensive evaluation of Pleiades 1A which is the first civilian satellite of Europe with sub-meter resolution. The analyses consist of radiometric evaluation, georeferencing accuracy assessment, pan-sharpening performance, digital surface/terrain model quality and vector map production. The effective resolution is estimated with a factor slightly below 1.0 for triplet panchromatic images, and signal to noise ratio is in the range of other comparable space borne images. The georeferencing accuracy was estimated with a standard deviation in X and Y directions in the range of 0.45m by bias-corrected and sensor-dependent rational functional model. 3D standard deviation of +/- 0.44m in X direction, +/- 0.51m in Y direction and +/- 1.82m in the Z direction were reached in spite of the very narrow angle of convergence by the same mathematical model. The generated digital surface/terrain models were achieved with +/- 1.6m standard deviation in Z direction in relation to a reference digital terrain model. The pan-sharpened images were generated by various methods, and were validated by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Moreover, a vector map was generated in the level of detail 0 to analyse information content.

TI  - On the Use of Geophysical Parameters for the Top-of-Atmosphere Shortwave Clear-Sky Radiance-to-Flux Conversion in EarthCARE
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We have investigated whether differences across Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) clear-sky angular distribution models, estimated separately over regional (1 degrees x 1 degrees longitude-latitude) and temporal (monthly) bins above land, can be explained by geophysical parameters from Max Planck Institute Aerosol Climatology, version 1 (MAC-v1), ECMWF twentieth-century reanalysis (ERA-20C), and a MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)/albedo/nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) gap-filled products (MCD43GF) climatology. Our research aimed to dissolve binning and to isolate inherent properties or indicators of such properties, which govern the TOA radiance-to-flux conversion in the absence of clouds. We collocated over seven million clear-sky footprints from CERES Single Scanner Footprint (SSF), edition 4, data with above geophysical auxiliary data. Looking at data per surface type and per scattering direction-as perceived by the broadband radiometer (BBR) on board Earth Clouds, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE)-we identified optimal subsets of geophysical parameters using two different methods: random forest regression followed by a permutation test and multiple linear regression combined with the genetic algorithm. Using optimal subsets, we then trained artificial neural networks (ANNs). Flux error standard deviations on unseen test data were on average 2.7-4.0 W m(-2), well below the 10 W m(-2) flux accuracy threshold defined for the mission, with the exception of footprints containing fresh snow. Dynamic surface types (i.e., fresh snow and sea ice) required simpler ANN input sets to guarantee mission-worthy flux estimates, especially over footprints consisting of several surface types.

AB  - Projection of future changes in agricultural water demand and supply through numerical model simulations can be one of the reference materials used for long-term rural planning under climate change. With a distributed hydrological model incorporating an agricultural sub-model, time-series rice growth and its yield can be simulated in correspondence with time-series soil moisture simulated by a hydrological model. Whereas such an agro-hydrological model is useful for assessing the climate change impact on agriculture in that it can simulate the potential rice production and the water-related damages on it against the given rainfall and meteorological condition, one of the challenges in simulating a realistic situation by a model is how to give a planting date in the model in regions where it is not fixed to a certain calendar date and differs in different fields and in different years. In this study, we examined an algorithm to estimate planting date in paddy fields using satellite data. The data we used are the 16-day composite Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) product by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), which provides global coverage with 250-m spatial resolution. The time series of the EVI values at each pixel was analyzed first to detect heading dates as the local maxima in each year. Considering the number of days for growing rice, the existence of the second and the third rice cropping was judged from the time intervals of the local maxima. The planting dates were then estimated from the determined heading dates and local minima of the EVI time-series EVI. The estimated planting dates were validated against national statistical data in Japan and also with field-surveyed data in Cambodia. They showed reasonable estimations in the areal statistics, but there remained gaps in the comparison at individual fields.

TI  - Extracting sinkhole features from time-series of TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sinkholes are significant geologic hazards that are mainly formed in water-soluble carbonate bedrocks such as limestone, dolomite or gypsum. Sinkhole formation causes the surface to subside or collapse suddenly without any prior warning, and therefore can lead to extensive damage and even loss of life and property. Delineating sinkholes is important for understanding hydrological processes and mitigating geological hazards in karst areas. The recent development in deriving high-resolution digital elevation models from space missions such as TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (TSX/TDX) enables us to delineate and analyze geomorphologic features and landscape structures at small scale (up to 2 m). In this study we use time-series of TSX/TDX data and develop an adaptive sinkhole-analysis method using interferometry observations. A wavelet-based refinement approach is implemented on interferomeric processing to reduce the baseline bias effects and align the interferometrically-derived DEMs. The multi-temporal DEMs are then successfully stacked using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to reconstruct a higher quality DEM. Finally, feature extraction using watershed algorithm is applied to precisely delineate geomorphometric characteristics of the sinkholes.Five TSX/TDX images are selected to evaluate the performance of our approach for sinkholes in Hamedan, West Iran. Results show that applying our methodology on high-resolution TSX/TDX data from different geometries and time periods enables us to effectively distinguish sinkholes from other depression features of the basin. Different TSX/TDX pairs produce consistent results for diameter and depth of sinkholes with the standard deviation of approximately 1 m, in agreement with field observations.

TI  - Near Infrared Fluorescent Lymph Node Mapping with Indocyanine Green in Breast Cancer Patients: A Prospective Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 130th Annual Meeting of the Southern-Surgical-Association
CL  - Palm Beach, FL
AB  - BACKGROUND: Near infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging is an emerging modality that can enable real-time image-guided procedures. Indocyanine green (ICG) is an FDA-approved, inexpensive, and widely available NIR dye. We hypothesized that axillary lymphatic mapping with ICG is equivalent to lymphatic mapping with technetium 99m (Tc-99m) in breast cancer patients.STUDY DESIGN: Breast cancer patients (cT1-2, N0) were prospectively enrolled. Patients underwent lymphatic mapping with Tc-99m preoperatively and ICG mapping intraoperatively (0.8 mL). Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy was guided by NIR camera and gamma probe. Rate of failed mapping, number of SLNs identified, and rate of identifying pathologically positive SLNs were compared between the 2 techniques (p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant).RESULTS: Ninety-two female patients were enrolled (median age 59 years). Mean transit time from ICG injection in the breast to localization in the axilla was 5 minutes (range 2 to 29 minutes). No adverse reactions to ICG were noted. Mean number of SLNs identified with ICG and Tc-99m was 2.4 (SD 1.42) and 2.2 (SD 1.23), respectively (p = 0.34). Pathologically positive SLNs were identified in 18 (19.8%) patients. A total of 24 pathologically positive SLNs in 18 patients were identified by ICG in 24 of 24 (100%) patients and by Tc-99m in 23 of 24 (96%) patients (p = 0.99).CONCLUSIONS: Indocyanine green with NIR fluorescence imaging can be safely and efficiently used for realtime intraoperative lymphatic mapping in breast cancer patients. Indocyanine green performs similarly to Tc-99m with regard to the number of SLNs identified, rate of failed mapping, and identification of pathologically positive SLNs.

TI  - Separation of excitation and detection coils for <i>in</i> <i>vivo</i> detection of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th Joint European Magnetic Symposia (JEMS)
CL  - Mainz, GERMANY
AB  - A novel probe for laparoscopic in vivo detection of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) has been developed. The main application for in vivo detection of SPIONs our research group aims at is sentinel node biopsy. This is a method to determine if a tumor has spread through the body, which helps to improve cancer patient care. The method we use to selectively detect SPIONs is Differential Magnetometry (DiffMag). DiffMag makes use of small magnetic field strengths in the mT range. For DiffMag, a handheld probe is used that contains excitation and detection coils. However, depth sensitivity of a handheld probe is restricted by the diameter of the coils. Therefore, excitation and detection coils are separated in our novel probe. As a result, excitation coils can be made large and placed underneath a patient to generate a sufficiently large volume for the excitation field. Detection coils are made small enough to be used in laparoscopic surgery. The main challenge of this setup is movement of detection coils with respect to excitation coils. Consequently, the detector signal is obscured by the excitation field, making it impossible to measure the tiny magnetic signature from SPIONs. To measure SPIONs, active compensation is used, which is a way to cancel the excitation field seen by the detection coils. SPIONs were measured in various amounts and at various distances from the excitation coils. Furthermore, SPIONs were measured in proximity to a surgical steel retractor, and 3 L water. It is shown that small amounts of SPIONs (down to 25 mu g Fe) can be measured, and SPIONs can be measured up to 20 cm from the top of the excitation coil. Also, surgical steel, and diamagnetism of water - and thus of tissue - have minor influence on DiffMag measurements. In conclusion, these results make this novel probe geometry combined with DiffMag promising for laparoscopic sentinel node biopsy.

TI  - Monitoring Reservoir Drought Dynamics with Landsat and Radar/Lidar Altimetry Time Series in Persistently Cloudy Eastern Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical reservoirs are critical infrastructure for managing drinking and irrigation water and generating hydroelectric power. However, long-term spaceborne monitoring of reservoir storage is challenged by data scarcity from near-persistent cloud cover and drought, which may reduce volumes below those in the observational record. In evaluating our ability to accurately monitor long-term reservoir volume dynamics using spaceborne data and overcome such observational challenges, we integrated optical, lidar, and radar time series to estimate reservoir volume dynamics across 13 reservoirs in eastern Brazil over a 12-year (2003-2014) period affected by historic drought. We (i) used 1560 Landsat images to measure reservoir surface area; (ii) built reservoir-specific regression models relating surface area and elevation from ICESat GLAS and Envisat RA-2 data; (iii) modeled volume changes for each reservoir; and (iv) compared modeled and in situ reservoir volume changes. Regression models had high goodness-of-fit (median RMSE = 0.89 m and r = 0.88) across reservoirs. Even though 88% of an average reservoir's volume time series was based on modeled area-elevation relationships, we found exceptional agreement (RMSE = 0.31 km(3) and r = 0.95) with in situ volume time series, and accurately captured seasonal recharge/depletion dynamics and the drought's prolonged drawdown. Disagreements in volume dynamics were neither driven by wet/dry season conditions nor reservoir capacity, indicating analytical efficacy across a range of monitoring scenarios.

TI  - Internal Mammary Chain Sentinel Nodes in Early-Stage Breast Cancer Patients: Toward Selective Removal
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRemoval of internal mammary chain sentinel nodes (IMCSNs) affects prognosis and treatment of breast cancer, and internal mammary chain radiotherapy (IMCRT) can improve survival for selected patients. This study aimed to determine the effect of IMCSN biopsy on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) and to identify predictive factors for IMCSN and distant metastasis.MethodsPatients with IMCSNs were selected from a prospective database for the period 1999-2007. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed after intratumoral technetium-99m injection, and all sentinel nodes were removed. Both RFS and OS were calculated for subgroups with tumor-positive, tumor-negative, or non-removed IMCSNs. Predictive factors were identified for tumor-positive IMCSNs and distant metastasis by regression analysis.ResultsFor 287 (85%) of 336 patients, IMCSN biopsy was performed, and metastasis was detected in 38 patients (13%). The patients with tumor-positive IMCSNs had poorer OS than the patients with no IMCSN metastasis or non-removed IMCSNs (p=0.002). These patients also had worse RFS due to distant metastasis (p=0.002). Axillary metastasis was predictive for tumor-positive IMCSNs (positive predictive value, 38.5%). The predictive factors for distant metastasis were tumor-positive IMCSNs (hazard ratio [HR], 2.5), non-removed IMCSNs (HR, 2.3), tumor diameter greater than 1.5cm (HR, 3.5), and age older than 65years (HR, 3.1; reference, <50years).ConclusionsPatients with IMCSNs have worse survival due to distant metastasis. The clinically relevant predictive factor for distant metastasis is tumor larger than 1.5cm. According to the authors' current protocol, IMCSN biopsy is performed for patients younger than 70years who have a tumor larger than 1.5cm, with the cardiotoxicity of the adjuvant IMCRT weighed against the survival benefit.

TI  - Does the subtype of breast cancer affect the diagnostic performance of axillary ultrasound for nodal staging in breast cancer patients?
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Imaging findings can be affected by histopathological characteristics, such as breast cancer subtypes. The aim was to determine whether the diagnostic performance, in particular negative predictive value (NPV), of axillary US differs per subtype of breast cancer.Methods: All patients diagnosed between 2008 and 2016 in our hospital with primary invasive breast cancer and an axillary US prior to axillary surgery were included. Histopathology of axillary surgery specimens served as gold standard. The NPV, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and accuracy of the axillary US were determined for the overall population and for each subtype (ER+/PR+HER2-,HER2+, triple negative tumors). The Chi-square test was used to determine the difference in diagnostic performance parameters between the subtypes.Results: A total of 1094 breast cancer patients were included. Of these, 35 were diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer, resulting in 1129 cancer cases. Most common subtype was ER+/PR+HER2- in 858 cases (76.0%), followed by 150 cases of HER2+ tumors (13.3%) and 121 cases of triple negative tumors (10.7%). Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of axillary US did not significantly differ between the subtypes. There was a significant difference for NPV between triple negative tumors and HER2+ tumors (90.3% vs. 80.2%, p = 0.05) and between HER2+ and ER/PR+HER2- tumors (80.2% vs. 87.2%, p = 0.04).Conclusion: There was no significant difference in the diagnostic performance of axillary US between the subtypes, except for NPV. This was highest in triple negative subtype and lowest in HER2+ tumors. This can be explained by the difference in prevalence of axillary lymph node metastases in our cohort.

AB  - ObjectiveThis study aims to evaluate whether extracapsular extension (ECE) in the sentinel lymph node (SLN) is associated with involvement of 4 lymph node metastases at completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and the effect on 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and 10-year overall survival (OS).Summary background dataECE in a SLN is usually a contraindication for omitting completion ALND in cT1-2N0 breast cancer patients treated with breast-conserving therapy and 1-2 positive SLN(s).MethodsAll cT1-2N0 breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive SLN(s) who underwent ALND between 2005 and 2008 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between ECE and 4 lymph node metastases. Five-year DFS and 10-year OS were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Cox regression analysis was performed to correct for other prognostic factors.ResultsA total of 3502 patients were included. Information on ECE was available for 2111 (60.3%) patients, consisting of 741 (35.1%) patients with and 1370 (64.9%) without ECE. The incidence of 4 lymph node metastases was 116 (15.7%) in the ECE group vs. 80 (5.8%) in the group without ECE (p<0.001). Five-year DFS rate was 86.4% in the ECE group compared to 88.8% in the group without ECE (p=0.085). 10-year OS rate was 78.6% compared to 83.0% (p=0.018), respectively. Cox regression analysis showed that ECE was not an independent prognostic factor for both DFS and OS.ConclusionsECE was significantly associated with involvement of 4 lymph node metastases in the completion ALND group. ECE was not an independent prognostic factor for both DFS and OS.

TI  - An assessment of potential groundwater recharge zones in Bulgaria
T2  - Geologica Balcanica
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater resources on the territory of Bulgaria are unevenly distributed in both spatial and temporal aspects. The effective usage of these valuable assets is of paramount importance, since any over-exploitation would eventually lead to their depletion. Remote sensing data and satellite images have increasingly been used in groundwater exploration and management. An integrated approach was applied in the present study in order to delineate potential groundwater recharge zones on the territory of Bulgaria. Data from various sources were used to prepare different thematic layers. These layers were then transformed into raster data of 1x1 km. Lineament and drainage density maps of the research area were made with the help of GIS technology. In addition, a map was made for the annual total precipitation for the period from 1931 to 1985. DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data on a global scale at 90 m horizontal resolution were used for the slope analysis. A groundwater potential map was produced, which integrates several thematic maps, such as annual rainfall, geology, lineament density, land use, slope, soils, and drainage density. The thematic maps were then converted into a raster graphic format in order to be easily integrated into a GIS platform. The raster maps of these factors were then allocated a fixed score and weight-computed. The weights of those factors contributing to the groundwater recharge were derived by using the following components: geological map, lineament-length density map, land cover data base, soil data base, drainage-length density map, and slope gradient map. Subjective weights were assigned to the respective thematic layers, and they were overlaid in a GIS platform for the identification of potential groundwater recharge zones within the study area. These potential recharge zones were then categorized as being very good, good, moderate, poor, and very poor.

TI  - Rural development and land use land cover change in a rapidly developing agrarian South Asian landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - It is a general belief that agricultural area, particularly in developing countries, is decreasing with rapid urbanization. This is an important phenomenon in the form of land use land cover change (LULCC) as these countries depend on agriculture to a great extent for food and economic growth. Using Landsat data our investigation in the rural area of Varanasi district revealed that agricultural area, which constituted about 50% of land cover, increased by 37% in the 1993-2013 period and built area increased by 236%. A Relative Rural Development Index (RRDI) was formulated to find out the comparative development in rural blocks of the district. RRDI was based on built, green and agriculture land use, and the number of agricultural workers, LAC and LCR. Kashi Vidyapeeth (KV) and Chiragaon (CG) rural blocks present in close proximity of the urban core had the highest RRDI score and change in Land Absorption Coefficient (LAC) and Land Consumption Ratio (LCR). Proximity to the urban area influenced rural development in the form of agricultural and built area increase. The study can be helpful for focussing development and policymaking efforts to a rural area according to its RRDI score.

TI  - Guidance of sentinel lymph node biopsy decisions in patients with T1-T2 melanoma using gene expression profiling
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Can gene expression profiling be used to identify patients with T1-T2 melanoma at low risk for sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity? Patients & methods: Bioinformatics modeling determined a population in which a 31-gene expression profile test predicted <5% SLN positivity. Multicenter, prospectively-tested (n=1421) and retrospective (n=690) cohorts were used for validation and outcomes, respectively. Results: Patients 55-64years and 65years with a class 1A (low-risk) profile had SLN positivity rates of 4.9%and 1.6%. Class 2B (high-risk) patients had SLN positivity rates of 30.8% and 11.9%. Melanoma-specific survival was 99.3% for patients 55years with class 1A, T1-T2 tumors and 55.0% for class 2B, SLN-positive, T1-T2 tumors. Conclusion: The 31-gene expression profile test identifies patients who could potentially avoid SLN biopsy.

TI  - Predictive Modeling of Future Forest Cover Change Patterns in Southern Belize
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests and the biodiversity they contain are declining at an alarming rate throughout the world. Although southern Belize is generally recognized as a highly forested landscape, it is becoming increasingly threatened by unsustainable agricultural practices. Deforestation data allow forest managers to efficiently allocate resources and inform decisions for proper conservation and management. This study utilized satellite imagery to analyze recent forest cover and deforestation in southern Belize to model vulnerability and identify the areas that are the most susceptible to future forest loss. A forest cover change analysis was conducted in Google Earth Engine using a supervised classification of Landsat 8 imagery with ground-truthed land cover points as training data. A multi-layer perceptron neural network model was performed to predict the potential spatial patterns and magnitude of forest loss based on the regional drivers of deforestation. The assessment indicates that the agricultural frontier will continue to expand into recently untouched forests, predicting a decrease from 75.0% mature forest cover in 2016 to 71.9% in 2026. This study represents the most up-to-date assessment of forest cover and the first vulnerability and prediction assessment in southern Belize with immediate applications in conservation planning, monitoring, and management.

TI  - Evapotranspiration estimation using SMAP soil moisture products and bouchet complementary evapotranspiration over Southern Great Plains
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important water withdrawal in the water balance, particularly in arid and semiarid regions. In this study, a formulation to derive the relative evapotranspiration (beta) and ET from in situ and passive microwave data, is presented. The original Komatsu's beta equation was modified by introducing a calibration parameter to eliminate the wind speed effects. Then, a simple formulation to estimate mean daily ET was obtained by combining the beta parameter, Bouchet's complementary relationship, and Priestley-Taylor's equation. Estimates of beta and ET were compared with ground observations in the study area, Southern Great Plains (SGP). These comparisons suggest that beta characterizes the relative evapotranspiration behavior in the region. Besides, ET results show a good agreement with ground data, yielding a root mean square error and bias of 28.5 and - 6 W/m(2), respectively. The proposed approach took advantages of passive microwave images, combining them with ground observations in a simple and robust equation.

TI  - Fully Automatic Spectral-Spatial Fuzzy Clustering Using an Adaptive Multiobjective Memetic Algorithm for Multispectral Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clustering of remote sensing imagery is a tough task due to the particular and complex structure of remote sensing images and the shortage of known information. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic spectral-spatial fuzzy clustering method using an adaptive multiobjective memetic algorithm (AMOMA) for multispectral remote sensing imagery. This approach is made up of two automatic layers: an automatic determination layer and an automatic clustering layer. The first layer seeks the optimal number of clusters through a self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm. The second layer then takes advantage of the AMOMA for spectral-spatial clustering using the optimal number of clusters. The knee point from the Pareto front is then selected through the angle-based method in every generation, and we then compare the knee points between generations to output the final optimal solution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the experimental results obtained with three remote sensing data sets.

TI  - Estimating the fractional cover of photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare soil from MODIS data: Assessing the applicability of the NDVI-DFI model in the typical Xilingol grasslands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative estimations of the fractional cover of photosynthetic vegetation (f(PV)), non-photosynthetic vegetation (f(NPV)) and bare soil (f(BS)) are critical for soil wind erosion, desertification, grassland grazing, grassland fire, and grassland carbon storage studies. At present, regional and large-scale f(PV), f(NPV) and f(BS) estimations have been carried out in many areas. However, few studies have used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to perform large-scale, long-term f(PV), f(NPV) and f(BS) estimations in the Xilingol grassland of China. The objective of this study was to quantitatively estimate the time series of f(PV), f(NPV) and f(BS) in the typical grassland region of Xilingol from MODIS image data. Field measurement spectral and coverage data from May and September 2017 were combined with the 8-day composite product (MOD09A1) acquired during 2017. We established an empirical linear model of different non-photosynthetic vegetation indices (NPVIs) and f(NPV) based on the sample scale. The linear correlation between the dead fuel index (DFI) and f(NPV) was best (R-2 = 0.60, RMSE = 0.15). A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-DFI model based on MODIS data was proposed to accurately estimate the f(PV), f(NPV) and f(BS) (estimation accuracies of 44%, 71%, and 74%, respectively) in the typical grasslands of Xilingol in China. The f(PV), f(NPV) and f(BS) values for the typical grassland time series estimated by the NDVI-DFI model were consistent with the phenological characteristics of the grassland vegetation. The results show that the application of the NDVI-DFI model to the Xilingol grassland is reasonable and appropriate, and it is of great significance to the monitoring of soil wind erosion and fires in grasslands.

TI  - Analysis of vegetation changes and dominant factors on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research was undertaken to clarify the characteristics of vegetation change and its main influencing factors on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Using the greenness rate of change (GRC) and correlation factors, we analyzed the trend of vegetation change and its dominant factors from 2000 to 2015. The results indicate that the vegetation tended to improve from 2000 to 2015 on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with the improved area accounting for 39.93% of the total; and the degraded area accounting for 19.32%. The areas of degraded vegetation are mainly concentrated in the low-relief and intermediate-relief mountains of the high-altitude and extremely high-altitude areas on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, as the vegetation characteristics are impacted by the terrain. Temperature and precipitation have obvious response mechanisms to vegetation growth, but the effects of precipitation and temperature on vegetation degradation are not significant over a short time frame. Overgrazing and population growth arc the dominant factors of vegetation degradation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

TI  - An Improved Spatial-Temporal Downscaling Method for TRMM Precipitation Datasets in Alpine Regions: A Case Study in Northwestern China's Qilian Mountains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques provide data on the spatial-temporal distribution of environmental parameters over regions with sparse ground observations. However, the resolution of satellite precipitation data is too coarse to be applied to hydrological and meteorological research at basin scales. Downscaling research using coarse remote sensing data to obtain high-resolution precipitation data is significant for the development of basin-scale research. Here, we propose improvements to a spatial-temporal method for downscaling satellite precipitation. The improved method uses a nonlinear regression model and introduces longitude and latitude based on processed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a digital elevation model (DEM) to stimulate precipitation in the Qilian Mountains during 2006-2015. The final downscaled annual precipitation (FDAP) results are corrected by observed data to obtain corrected final downscaled annual precipitation (CFDAP) datasets. For temporal downscaling, monthly downscaled data are the corrected monthly ratio multiplied by the corresponding downscaled annual datasets. The results indicated that processed NDVI (PNDVI) reflected spatial precipitation patterns more accurately than the original NDVI. The accuracy was significantly improved when the final downscaled annual precipitation data were corrected by observed data. The average annual root mean square error (RMSE) from 2006 to 2015 of CFDAP was 66.48 and 83.07 mm less than that of FDAP and original Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data, respectively. Compared with previous methods, which use NDVI and/or DEM to downscale TRMM, the accuracy of FDAP and CFDAP from the improved method was higher, and the RMSE decreased on average by 13.63 and 80.11 mm. The RMSE of monthly data from corrected monthly ratio (CMR) decreased on average by 4.93 mm over monthly data from previous monthly ratio (PMR). In addition, the accuracy of the original satellite data affected the initial downscaling results but had no significant effects on the corrected downscaling results.

TI  - A radiance-based split-window algorithm for land surface temperature retrieval: Theory and application to MODIS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The split-window algorithm is the most commonly used method for land surface temperature (1ST) retrieval from satellite data. Simplification of the Planck's function, as an important step in developing the SWA, allows us to directly relate the radiance to the temperature toward solving the radiative transfer equation (RTE) set. In this study, Planck's radiance relationship between two adjacent thermal infrared channels was modeled to solve the RTE set instead of simplification of the Planck's function. A radiance-based split-window algorithm (RBSWA) was developed and applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The performance of the RBSWA was assessed and compared with three most common brightness temperature-based split-window algorithms (BTBSWAs) by using the simulated data and satellite measurements. Simulation analysis showed that the 1ST retrieval using RBSWA had a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.5 K and achieved an improvement of 0.3 K compared with three BTBSWAs, and the 1ST retrieval accuracy using RBSWA was better than 1.5 K considering uncertainties in input parameters based on the sensitivity analysis. For application of RBSWA to MODIS data, the results showed that: 1) comparison between 1ST from MODIS 1ST product and 1ST retrieved using RBSWA showed a mean RMSE of 1.33 K for 108 groups of MODIS image covering continental US, which indicates RBSWA is reliable and robust; 2) when using the measurements from US surface radiation budget network as real values the RMSE of the RBSWA algorithm was 2.55 K and was slightly better than MODIS 1ST product; and 3) through the cross validation using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 1ST product, the RMSE of the RBSWA algorithm was 2.23 K and was 0.28 K less than that of MODIS 1ST product. We conclude that the RBSWA for 1ST retrieval from MODIS data can attain a better accuracy than the BTBSWA.

TI  - Estimation of leaf area index from high resolution ZY-3 satellite imagery in a catchment dominated by Larix principis-rupprechtii, northern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key factor that determines a forest ecosystem's net primary production and energy exchange between the atmosphere and land surfaces. LAI can be measured in many ways, but there has been little research to compare LAI estimated by different methods. In this study, we compared the LAI results from two different approaches, i.e., the dimidiate pixel model (DPM) and an empirical statistic model (ESM) using ZY-3 high-accuracy satellite images validated by field data. We explored the relationship of LAI of Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr plantations with topographic conditions. The results show that DPM improves the simulation of LAI (r=0.86, RMSE=0.57) compared with ESM (r=0.62, RMSE=0.79). We further concluded that elevation and slope significantly affect the distribution of LAI. The maximum peak of LAI appeared at an aspect of east and southeast at an elevation of 1700-2000m. Our results suggest that ZY-3 can satisfy the needs of quantitative monitoring of leaf area indices in small-scale catchment areas. DPM provides a simple and accurate method to obtain forest vegetation parameters in the case of non-ground measurement points.

TI  - An Improved Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Data Fusion Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous high spatio-temporal resolution monitoring of evapotranspiration (ET) is critical for water resource management and the quantification of irrigation water efficiency at both global and local scales. However, available remote sensing satellites cannot generally provide ET data at both high spatial and temporal resolutions. Data fusion methods have been widely applied to estimate ET at a high spatio-temporal resolution. Nevertheless, most fusion methods applied to ET are initially used to integrate land surface reflectance, the spectral index and land surface temperature, and few studies completely consider the influencing factor of ET. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents an improved ET fusion method, namely, the spatio-temporal adaptive data fusion algorithm for evapotranspiration mapping (SADFAET), by introducing critical surface temperature (the corresponding temperature to decide soil moisture), importing the weights of surface ET-indicative similarity (the influencing factor of ET, which is estimated from remote sensing data) and modifying the spectral similarity (the differences in spectral characteristics of different spatial resolution images) for the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM). We fused daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and periodic Landsat 8 ET data in the SADFAET for the experimental area downstream of the Heihe River basin from April to October 2015. The validation results, based on ground-based ET measurements, indicated that the SADFAET could successfully fuse MODIS and Landsat 8 ET data (mean percent error: -5%), with a root mean square error of 45.7 W/m(2), whereas the ESTARFM performed slightly worse, with a root mean square error of 50.6 W/m(2). The more physically explainable SADFAET could be a better alternative to the ESTARFM for producing ET at a high spatio-temporal resolution.

TI  - Estimating the Volume of Oil Tanks Based on High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to obtain oil tank volumes from high-resolution satellite imagery to meet the need to measure oil tank volume globally. A preprocessed remote sensing HSV image is used to extract the shadow of the oil tank by Otsu thresholding, shadow area thresholding, and morphological closing. The oil tank shadow is crescent-shaped. Hence, a median method based on sub-pixel subdivision positioning is used to calculate the shadow length of the oil tank and then determine its height with high precision. The top of the tank and its radius in the image are identified using the Hough transform. The final tank volume is calculated using its height and radius. A high-resolution Gaofen 2 optical remote sensing image is used to evaluate the proposed method. The actual height and volume of the tank we tested were 21.8 m and 109,532 m(3). The experimental results show that the mean absolute error of the height of the tank calculated by the median method is 0.238 m, the relative error is within 1.15%, and the RMES is 0.23. The result is better than the previous work. The absolute error between the calculated and the actual tank volumes ranges between 416 and 3050 m(3), and the relative error ranges between 0.38% and 2.78%. These results indicate that the proposed method can calculate the volume of oil tanks with high precision and sufficient accuracy for practical applications.

TI  - Location of arm draining lymph node in relation to breast cancer radiotherapy field and target volume
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymphoedema of the arm following axillary surgery or radiotherapy remains a significant side effect affecting some women after breast cancer treatment. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) is a technique used to identify the lymph node draining the arm (ARM node). Our study aim was to examine the location of the ARM nodes in relation to target volumes and treatment fields for breast cancer radiotherapy.Materials and methods: Eighteen breast cancer patients underwent lymphoscintigraphy of contralateral arm (left 10, right 8) and SPECT CT scan on a research study. Patient position for the SPECT CT scan approximated the position used for radiotherapy. Using MIM software (TM), the ARM node for each subject was contoured on the SPECT CT and verified by a nuclear medicine physician. The CT component of the SPECT CT was then transferred to ECLIPSE (TM) radiotherapy planning software, and the contralateral breast and axilla were contoured on this CT scan according to the ESTRO contouring guideline. Two radiotherapy plans were generated for each subject using standard tangential IMRT technique at a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions, one treating contralateral breast alone, the other treating contralateral breast and contralateral axilla level 1-4. The ARM node was considered "within the radiotherapy field" if the mean dose received by the ARM node was more than 50% of the prescribed dose: i. e., 25 Gy.Results: One right-sided subject had 2 ARM nodes, all others had 1 ARM node. All ARM nodes (left 10, right 9) were located within level 1 of the axilla. For the subject with 2 ARM nodes, the node that received a higher dose was used for the analysis. The mean dose received by the ARM node in the whole breast radiotherapy plans ranged from 0.8 to 45.5 Gy, with a median of 10.9 Gy. The mean dose received by the ARM node in the whole breast and axilla plans ranged from 43.4 to 52.5 Gy, with a median of 49.3 Gy. In the whole breast radiotherapy plans, only 5 out of 18 ARM nodes were found to be "within radiotherapy field", and only 2 ARM nodes received more than 40 Gy. In the breast and axilla plans, all 18 ARM nodes were "within radiotherapy field" and all received more than 40 Gy. To better visualise the locations of ARM nodes, all left sided ARM nodes were then mapped onto a CT set from one of the left-sided subjects, and all the right sided ARM nodes mapped onto one of the right-sided subjects, and digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) for radiotherapy fields were produced.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the vast majority of ARM nodes (72%) are outside the tangential whole breast radiotherapy fields. In our study, all the ARM nodes were within the axillary radiotherapy fields covering level 1-4 axillary volumes according to the ESTRO contouring guideline, and complete shielding of the humeral head according to the EORTC consensus did not lead to sparing of the ARM nodes. A prospective study is needed to examine the oncological safety of ARM node-sparing axillary radiotherapy and its potential to reduce the risk of arm lymphoedema. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Changes in Vegetation Greenness in the Upper and Middle Reaches of the Yellow River Basin over 2000-2015
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Grain to Green Project (GTGP), a large ecological restoration project aiming to control soil erosion and improve the ecological environment, has been implemented since 1999 and has led to great land use changes with decreased farmland and increased forest and grass, and significant vegetation variations. Understanding vegetation variations for different land use types is important for accessing the present vegetation development and providing scientific guidance for future ecological restoration design and regional sustainable development. With two land use maps and MODIS LAI data, trend analysis, fluctuation analysis, and R/S methods were applied to analyze the vegetation dynamic changes and sustainability for converted land use types from cropland and unconverted types over 2000-2015 in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River. The results obtained were as follows: (1) Vegetation greening was remarkable in the entire study region (0.036 yr(-1)). The increasing rate was higher in wetter conditions with AI < 3 (0.036-0.053 yr(-1)) than arid regions with AI > 3 (0.012-0.024 yr(-1)). (2) Vegetation improved faster for converted forestland, shrubland, and grassland than unconverted types under similar drying conditions. Converted shrubland and grassland had a larger relative change than converted forestland. (3) Converted land use types generally exhibited stronger fluctuation than unconverted types with small differences among types. (4) Vegetation exhibited a sustainable increasing trend in the future, which accounted for more than 73.1% of the region, mainly distributed in the middle reach of the Yellow River. Vegetation restoration exerted important influences on vegetation greening and the effect was stronger for converted types than unconverted types.

TI  - Remote sensing image-based analysis of the urban heat island effect in Shenzhen, China
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island effect is a typical urban climate phenomenon, and the formation and intensity of these phenomena are closely related to the land cover type. Based on Landsat 8 remote sensing images of Shenzhen, China, this study uses a linear spectral mixture model to extract land coverage information, and then analyzes the effects of urban land coverage on the land surface temperature (LST) and heat budget components. The results show that the LST of Shenzhen decreases gradually from northwest to southeast and that the LST of urban impervious surfaces are significantly higher than those of vegetation-covered areas with a difference of 3-4 K, thus demonstrating a significant urban heat island effect. Impervious surfaces and urban vegetation both affect the LST and heat budget components of Shenzhen. The impervious area contributes more to the surface sensible heat, while urban vegetation contributes more to the surface latent heat. The research results show that a very small area of urban green land (vegetation fraction coverage less than 4-8%) exhibits a strong capacity for heat dissipation. In the practice of urban construction, avoiding concentrated impervious areas and increasing urban green land areas represent effective methods of alleviating the urban heat island effect. This study helps to better understand the optimization of urban landscapes and alleviation of the urban heat island effect.

TI  - Construction land sprawl and reclamation in the Johor River Estuary of Malaysia since 1973
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Johor River is the main source of water in Johor Bahru and Singapore as well as a vital maritime passage in the eastern Straits of Johor. However, the Johor River Estuary (JRE) has been experiencing environmental degradation due to construction land sprawl and reclamation (CLSR), which shows a combined effect of anthropogenic environmental change. In this paper, the spatial and temporal variation of CLSR in the JRE was studied based on twelve multi-temporal Landsat images (Landsat MSS, TM and OLI) obtained from 1973 to 2017. The results showed that the area of construction land increased more than 10-fold from 1973 (13.33 km(2)) to 2017 (135.46 km(2)). Each type of construction land showed an increasing tendency, and their area-weighted centroids migrated towards the mouth of the Johor River. Over the last four decades, an increased land area of 40.32 km(2) contributed by reclamation was mainly distributed in the Tekong Island and the eastern Singapore Islands, which shortened the minimum distance between lands in the JRE. The largest decrease in minimum distance was 1889 m between Johor Bahru and Tekong Island. CLSR is mainly driven by human activities such as population growth, economic development and policy change. To better protect the coastal environment in the JRE, construction land expansion and reclamation activities should be planned properly by the local government.

TI  - Risk factors and a predictive nomogram for non-sentinel lymph node metastases in Chinese breast cancer patients with one or two sentinel lymph node macrometastases and mastectomy
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Two ongoing prospective randomized trials are evaluating whether omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with breast cancer (BCA) and sentinel lymph node (SLN) macrometastases undergoing mastectomy is safe. Determining predictive risk factors for non-SLN metastases and developing a model to predict the probability of those patients having non-SLN metastases is also important.Methods This retrospective study enrolled 396 patients with BCA and 1-2 SLNS with macrometastases who underwent ALND and mastectomy between January 2012 and December 2016. Factors influencing the non-SLN metastases were determined, and a predictive nomogram was formulated. Performance of the nomogram was evaluated by its area under the curve (AUC).Results We developed a predictive nomogram with an AUC of 0.81 (cross-validation 95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 0.86) that included 4 factors (tumour size, histologic grade, and number of negative SLNs and axillary lymph nodes on imaging).Conclusions Our predictive nomogram assesses the risk of non-SLN metastases in patients with BCA and 1-2 SLN macrometastases undergoing mastectomy.

TI  - Segmentation model for hyperspectral remote sensing images based on spectral angle constrained active contour
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose an alternative hyperspectral image segmentation method based on a geometric active contour model. First, we use a spectral angle as a measure index to measure the spectral similarity between the pixels, and the spectral angle constrained function is constructed based on spectral similarity. Then, depending on the class separability criterion, an optimal band is chosen which is suitable for image segmentation. The model retains advantages of the traditional C-V model in regional information with rich textures and edges. Its unique feature is exploiting the characteristics of hyperspectral remote sensing images in regions with abundant spectral information. As a consequence, the capture capability, segmentation speed, and accuracy are enhanced. Finally, we present experiments using WorldView and Hyperion images, from whose results demonstrate the improved attributes of the proposed method over those of the traditional C-V model. The proposed model provides better results than the traditional models both in segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency.

TI  - A SAR Dataset of Ship Detection for Deep Learning under Complex Backgrounds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the launch of space-borne satellites, more synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are available than ever before, thus making dynamic ship monitoring possible. Object detectors in deep learning achieve top performance, benefitting from a free public dataset. Unfortunately, due to the lack of a large volume of labeled datasets, object detectors for SAR ship detection have developed slowly. To boost the development of object detectors in SAR images, a SAR dataset is constructed. This dataset labeled by SAR experts was created using 102 Chinese Gaofen-3 images and 108 Sentinel-1 images. It consists of 43,819 ship chips of 256 pixels in both range and azimuth. These ships mainly have distinct scales and backgrounds. Moreover, modified state-of-the-art object detectors from natural images are trained and can be used as baselines. Experimental results reveal that object detectors achieve higher mean average precision (mAP) on the test dataset and have high generalization performance on new SAR imagery without land-ocean segmentation, demonstrating the benefits of the dataset we constructed.

TI  - A Three-Hierarchy Evaluation of Polarimetric Performance of GF-3, Compared with ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and RADARSAT-2
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen-3 (GF-3) is the first Chinese civilian multi-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, launched on 10 August of 2016, and put into operation at the end of January 2017. The polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) system of GF-3 is able to provide quad-polarization (quad-pol) images in a variety of geophysical research and applications. However, this ability increases the complexity of maintaining image quality and calibration. As a result, to evaluate the quality of polarimetric data, polarimetric signatures are necessary to guarantee accuracy. Compared with some other operational space-borne PolSAR systems, such as ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 (ALOS-2) and RADARSAT-2, GF-3 has less reported calibration and image quality files, forcing users to validate the quality of polarimetric imagery of GF-3 before quantitative applications. In this study, without the validation data obtained from a calibration infrastructure, an innovative, three-hierarchy strategy was proposed to assess PolSAR data quality, in which the performance of GF-3 data was evaluated with ALOS-2 and RADARSAT-2 data as references. Experimental results suggested that: (1) PolSAR data of GF-3 satisfied backscatter reciprocity, similar with that of RADARSAT-2; (2) most of the GF-3 PolSAR images had no signs of polarimetric distortion affecting decomposition, and the system of GF-3 may have been improved around May 2017; and (3) the classification accuracy of GF-3 varied from 75.0% to 91.4% because of changing image-acquiring situations. In conclusion, the proposed three-hierarchy approach has the ability to evaluate polarimetric performance. It proved that the residual polarimetric distortion of calibrated GF-3 PolSAR data remained at an insignificant level, with reference to that of ALOS-2 and RADARSAT-2, and imposed no significant impact on the polarimetric decomposition components and classification accuracy.

TI  - Aerosol Retrieval in the Autumn and Winter From the Red and 2.12 μm Bands of MODIS
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the autumn and winter, aerosol is the important atmospheric pollutant over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. For monitoring aerosol in the autumn and winter, the lack of vegetation and the aging of MODIS sensor are two problems that needed to be solved. In this paper, after analyzing the characteristics of aerosol radiance in the red and shortwave infrared (2.12 mu m) bands of MODIS, we develop a new algorithm for terrestrial aerosol with the assumption that the reflectance ratio between the red and 2.12 mu m bands is invariant. With MODIS data over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from September 2016 to February 2017, the algorithm is applied to aerosol retrieval. The retrieved aerosol optical depth images show that our algorithm can retrieve aerosol over sparse vegetation, and the validation with the AERONET/PHOTONS Beijing site shows that the correlation is greater than 0.9% and 77% of the retrievals fall within the expected error. An error analysis shows that a 2% error in the proportion of the soot component can lead to 15% retrieval error, and over more than 60% of the surface area, the error from the changes in the ratio between the red and 2.12 mu m bands can lead to retrieved errors less than 0.1.

TI  - Identifying and extracting a seasonal streamflow signal from remotely sensed snow cover in the Columbia River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the western United States, meltwater from mountain snowpacks serves as the dominant water supply for many communities. Efficient distribution and use of this renewable, yet temporally and spatially variable resource relies critically on accurate forecasting of future water availability. Here we report on initial efforts to use Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) data on snow coverage to forecast flow in six selected watersheds within the Columbia River Basin. Little research has been done on identifying the relationship between seasonal discharge volume and these satellite-derived snow cover data. In the Yakima watershed within the Columbia River Basin, we could explain 52% of the spring discharge (April - July total streamflow volume) variance by selecting specific 24-km grid cells that exhibit both strong correlation with historical flows as well as high inter-annual variation. This approach yielded reasonable success in other watersheds. Of the six Columbia River subbasins examined in this paper, five of them give statistically significant predictors of April - July streamflow volume at the alpha = 0.05 level. When comparing this optimized specific-cell technique to the overall average across the entire watershed of interest, we observe improvements in each of our six subbasins, although in some regions, improvements were minimal. Clearly, this optimization technique is inherently limited by the role of snow cover variation in determining streamflow discharges in different subbasins. For both mountainous regions with extensive and stable snow cover as well as low-elevation regions with consistently minimal snow, the snow cover variation only accounts for a small inter-annual streamflow discharge variance. Our methodology shows that the IMS provides remotely-sensed data that are ready to "plug and play" into existing streamflow forecast models such as the Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) Visual Interactive Prediction and Estimation Routines (VIPER).

TI  - A new satellite-based indicator to identify spatiotemporal foraging areas for herbivorous waterfowl
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of food resources is a key factor in habitat selection. Herbivorous waterfowl prefer early-stage growing plants (from the onset of plant growth to the peak in nutrient biomass) as these offer higher energy intake rates. This plant development stage is not fully captured by commonly used satellite-derived vegetation indicators, which focus on plant biomass (e.g., Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) or active plant growth (e.g., the differential EVI between current and a previous date, diffEVI). To improve mapping suitable grazing areas for herbivorous waterfowl, we propose a new satellite-based plant growth indicator of early-stage plant growth (ESPG). We hypothesize that herbivorous waterfowl prefer plants at an early development stage during the growing season and select plants with a relatively later end of ESPG during the non-growing season. We use satellite tracking data of 20 greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) wintering in the Yangtze River flood-plain to validate our predictions. We build generalized linear models for goose distributions during the growing and non-growing seasons and compare the performance of ESPG to commonly used plant growth indictors (EVI and diffEVI). During the growing season, ESPG can explain 53% of variation in the goose distribution, outperforming EVI (27%) and diffEVI (34%). During the non-growing season, only the end of ESPG significantly influences goose distribution, explaining 25% of the variance (ESPG: AUC= 0.78; EVI: AUC= 0.58; diffEVI: AUC= 0.58). The newly-developed plant growth indicator ESPG could be used to improve models of herbivorous waterfowl distributions and hence support efforts toward waterfowl conservation and wetland management.

TI  - Improved merge schemes for MODIS Collection 6.1 Dark Target and Deep Blue combined aerosol products
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Our previous study illustrated that the operational Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 (C6.1) Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) combined products (denoted as DTB0) are not always the best in most regions due to its unsuitable merge approach. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop an improved merge approach to increase the spatiotemporal data coverage and reduce the estimation uncertainty. For this, three tests, i.e., a land-use-type test, a surface-relief test, and an aerosol-type test are performed according to the strengths and weakness of the performances of the DT and DB algorithms with their high-quality assurance retrievals (QA = 3 for DT and QA >= 2 for DB) against the newest Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 3 Level 2.0 measurements. Based on this, new merged DT and DB products (denoted as DTB1) are generated. The Terra and Aqua DTB1 products are then validated against AERONET measurements at 286 sites on site, continental, and global scales, and for varying underlying surfaces and elevated terrains from 2013 to 2017. The DTB0 products for the same period are collected for comparison. More than 90% of the sites now have more data points, and the performances of the DTB1 products are improved with an increased percentage of the data falling within the expected error [+/- (0.05 + 15%)] envelope and reduced mean absolute errors and root-mean-square errors compared with DTB0 products at most sites. Separate- and equal-number comparisons show that the DTB1 products significantly improve both the data coverage and data quality. The new merged products are more accurate and less affected by varying surface structures than the operational products. These results suggest that the improved merge approach is more robust and can be used for generating more accurate global aerosol products.

TI  - Monitoring 3D Building Change and Urban Redevelopment Patterns in Inner City Areas of Chinese Megacities Using Multi-View Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inner-city redevelopment is regarded as an effective way to promote land-use efficiency and optimize land-use structure, especially with the establishment of urban growth boundaries in Chinese cities. However, inner-city redevelopment as compared to urban sprawl has been rarely monitored in 2D space, let alone in 3D space. Therefore, in this paper, a novel approach to generate time-series 3D building maps (i.e., building footprint and height) based on high-resolution (2 m) multi-view ZY-3 satellite imagery was proposed. In the proposed method, the building footprint was updated by an object-based image-to-map change detection method, which employed spectral (i.e., HSV and NDVI) and structural features (i.e., morphological building index) to extract non-building and building objects, respectively; building height was estimated automatically through semi-global matching of multi-view images. We applied the proposed method to four representative Chinese megacities, i.e., Beijing, Xi'an, Shanghai, and Wuhan, for the period 2012-2017, and detected building footprints with overall accuracies ranging from 84.84% to 97.60%. The building height estimation was also relatively accurate, with the bias, slope, and root-mean-square error being -0.49-2.30 m, 0.93-1.10 m, and 4.94-7.31 m, respectively. Our results show that the total building coverage decreased over the study period, accompanied by an increase in both area-weighted building height and floor area ratio. In addition, compact low-rise buildings have been replaced by open high-rise buildings in the urban redevelopment process. Moreover, due to the scattered spatial distribution of the redevelopment sites, the local spatial aggregation patterns of building density are unlikely to shift between hotspots (i.e., spatial aggregation of high values) and coldspots (i.e., spatial aggregation of low values).

TI  - Propagation characteristics of mesospheric concentric gravity waves excited by a thunderstorm
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - This work used the all-sky airglow data of the Shuozhou station from Meridian Space Weather Monitoring Project, National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Black Body Temperature (TBB) data from FY-2 meteorological satellites, CG (cloud-ground) flash data, reanalysis data of NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) and ECWMF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). We analyzed a concentric gravity waves (CGWs) event observed in the middle and upper atmosphere over North China on 10 August 2013 (local time), caused by a thunderstorm in the troposphere. The ray tracing simulation suggests that the concentric rings observed by all-sky airglow imager in 87 km were motivated by this convective system, of which the convective center was located in the middle of Inner Mongolia autonomous region (108. 9 degrees E,40. 47 degrees N). At the initial stage, the small area of deep convection with TBB below 220 K excited the CGWs. The stronger convection occurred along with the system development, and deep convection area reached its maximum at 23 : 00 LT. During 23 : 30 LT to 24 :00 LT, the CG lightning flash frequency reached the maximum 120.7 fl/min, and then deep convection eventually disappeared. At the middle and upper atmosphere, the excitation source was 149. 64 km and 174. 25 km away from the CGWs ripples in 87 km by all-sky imager, and the horizontal wavelengths were 12. 67 km and 16. 75 km, periods of waves were 8. 56 min and 10. 72 min, and the excited times are 19 :34 and 19 :40 LT, respectively. With the increase of horizontal propagation distance, the horizontal wave length of CGWs increased.

TI  - The role of understory phenology and productivity in the carbon dynamics of longleaf pine savannas
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Savanna ecosystems contribute similar to 30% of global net primary production (NPP), but they vary substantially in composition and function, specifically in the understory, which can result in complex responses to environmental fluctuations. We tested how understory phenology and its contribution to ecosystem productivity within a longleaf pine ecosystem varied at two ends of a soil moisture gradient (mesic and xeric). We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the understory and ecosystem productivity estimates from eddy covariance systems to understand how variation in the understory affected overall ecosystem recovery from disturbances (drought and fire). We found that the mesic site recovered more rapidly from the disturbance of fire, compared to the xeric site, indicated by a faster increase in NDVI. During drought, understory NDVI at the xeric site decreased less compared to the mesic site, suggesting adaptation to lower soil moisture conditions. Our results also show large variation within savanna ecosystems in the contribution of the understory to ecosystem productivity and recovery, highlighting the critical need to further subcategorize global savanna ecosystems by their structural features, to accurately predict their contribution to global estimates of NPP.

TI  - A community-based test of the Dual Process Model of Intergroup Relations: Predicting attitudes towards Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, and Atheists
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research in New Zealand and elsewhere has shown that attitudes towards Muslims has been generally negative. Antipathy towards a variety of outgroups has previously been shown to be predicted by a combination of competitive/dangerous worldview and social dominant and authoritarian attitudes in Duckitt's (2001) dual-process cognitive-motivational model of ideology and prejudice. In this research, approximately one thousand New Zealanders completed measures of these variables, and their attitudes towards a range of groups: including Atheists, Christians, Hindus, Jews, and Muslims. Muslims were evaluated most negatively of the religion-based groups, and this was predicted by both the social dominance and authoritarianism 'routes' described in the dual-process model. This suggests that Muslims are seen as threatening both hierarchical and traditional social relationships.

TI  - Comparison of two-dimensional multitemporal Sentinel-2 data with three-dimensional remote sensing data sources for forest inventory parameter estimation over a boreal forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - National Forest Inventories (NFI) are key data and tools to better understand the role of forests in the global carbon budget. Traditionally inventories have been carried out as field work, which makes them laborious and expensive. In recent years, the development of various remote sensing techniques to improve the cost-efficiency of the NFIs has accelerated. The goal of this study is to determine the usability of open and free multitemporal multispectral satellite images from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite constellation and to compare their usability in forest inventories against airborne laserscanning (ALS) and three-dimensional data obtained with high-resolution optical satellite images from WorldView-2 and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) stereo data from TerraSAR-X. Ground reference consisted of field data collected over 74 boreal forest plots in Southern Finland in 2014 and 2016. Features utilizing both single- and multiple-date information were designed and tested for Sentinel-2 data. Due to high cloud cover, only four Sentinel-2 images were available for the multi-temporal feature analysis of all reference plots within the monitoring window. Random Forest technique was used to find the best descriptive feature sets to model five forest inventory parameters (mean height, mean diameter at breast height, basal area, volume, above-ground biomass) from all input remote sensing data. The results confirmed that the higher spatial resolution input data correlated with more accurate forest inventory parameter predictions, which is in line with other results presented in literature. The addition of temporal information to the Sentinel-2 results showed limited variation in prediction accuracy between the single and multidate cases ranging from 0.45 to 1.5 percentage points, whereof mean height, basal area and aboveground biomass are lower for single date with relative RMSEs of 14.07%, 20.66% and 24.71% respectively. Diameter at breast height and volume are lower for multi date feature combination with relative RMSEs of 18.38% and 27.21%. The results emphasize the importance of obtaining more evenly distributed data acquisitions over the growing season to fully exploit the potential of temporal features.

TI  - Setting the baseline for shale gas - Establishing effective sentinels for water quality impacts of unconventional hydrocarbon development
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a need for the development of effective baselines against which the water quality impacts of industry in general, and shale gas extraction specifically, can be assessed. The salinity, and hence the specific conductance, of fluids associated with shale gas extraction is typically many times higher that of river water. The contrast between these two water types means that testing for salinity (specific conductance) could provide an ideal sentinel for detecting environmental impact of shale gas extraction. Here, Bayesian generalised linear modelling was used to predict specific conductance across English surface waters. The modelling used existing, spot-sampled data from 2005 to 2015 from 123 sites to assess whether this approach could predict variation for subsequent years or for a new site (data from 2002 to 2015). We show that the results were readily projected in to subsequent years for sites included in the initial analysis. The use of covariates (land-use, hydroclimatic and soil descriptors) did not prove useful in predicting specific conductance at further sites not previously included in the analysis. The extension of the approach to 6833 English river monitoring sites with 10 or more observations from more than one year over the period 2005-2015 showed that it was possible to reproduce the seasonal variation in river water specific conductance. The approach taken here shows that it is possible to use low-frequency but widespread monitoring data to predict natural variation at monitoring sites to give a probabilistic assessment of whether or not a pollution incident has occurred and the seasonal variation, expressed as uncertainty bounds around the observations, at a specific site has been exceeded.

TI  - Long-Term Variations in the Pixel-to-Pixel Variability of NOAA AVHRR SST Fields from 1982 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) fields obtained from the series of space-borne five-channel Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRRs) provide the longest continuous time series of global SST available to date (1981-present). As a result, these data have been used for many studies and significant effort has been devoted to their careful calibration in an effort to provide a climate quality data record. However, little attention has been given to the local precision of the SST retrievals obtained from these instruments, which we refer to as the pixel-to-pixel (p2p) variability, a characteristic important in the ability to resolve structures such as ocean fronts characterized by small gradients in the SST field. In this study, the p2p variability is estimated for Level-2 SST fields obtained with the Pathfinder retrieval algorithm for AVHRRs on NOAA-07, 9, 11, 12 and 14-19. These estimates are stratified by year, season, day/night and along-scan/along-track. The overall variability ranges from 0.10 K to 0.21 K. For each satellite, the along-scan variability is between 10 and 20% smaller than the along-track variability (except for NOAA-16 nighttime for which it is approximately 30% smaller) and the summer and fall <>sigma</>s are between 10 and 15% smaller than the winter and spring <>sigma</>s. The differences between along-track and along-scan are attributed to the way in which the instrument has been calibrated. The seasonal differences result from the <>T4-T5</> term in the Pathfinder retrieval algorithm. This term is shown to be a major contributor to the p2p variability and it is shown that its impact could be substantially reduced without a deleterious effect on the overall p2p <>sigma</> of the resulting products by spatially averaging it as part of the retrieval process. The AVHRR/3s (NOAA-15 through 19) were found to be relatively stable with trends in the p2p variability of at most 0.015 K/decade.

TI  - Space weathering of the Moon from <i>in situ</i> detection
T2  - RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Space weathering is an important surface process that occurs on the Moon and other airless bodies, especially those that have no magnetic field. The optical effects of the Moon's space weathering have largely been investigated in the laboratory for lunar samples and lunar analogues. However, duplication of pristine regolith on Earth is not possible. Here we report on space weathering from the unique perspective of the "Yutu" rover, which was part of the Chang'e-3 (CE-3) mission, building on our previous work. Measurement of the visually undisturbed uppermost regolith as well as locations that have been affected by rocket exhaust from the spacecraft by the Visible-Near Infrared Spectrometer (VNIS) revealed that the returned samples provide biased information about the pristine lunar regolith. The uppermost surficial regolith is much more weathered than the regolith immediately below, and the finest fraction is rich in space weathered products. These materials are very dark and attenuated throughout the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) wavelengths, hence reducing the reflectance and masking the absorption features. The effects on the spectral slope caused by space weathering are wavelength-dependent: the visible and near-infrared continuum slope (VNCS) increases while the visible slope (VS) decreases. In the visible wavelengths, the optical effects of space weathering and TiO2 are identical: both reduce albedo and blue the spectra. This suggests that a new TiO2 abundance algorithm is needed. Optical maturity indices are related to composition and hence only locally meaningful. Since optical remote sensing can only sense the uppermost few microns of regolith and since this surface tends to be very weathered, the interpretation of surface composition using optical remote sensing data needs to be carefully evaluated. Sampling the uppermost surface is suggested.

TI  - Semantic segmentation of slums in satellite images using transfer learning on fully convolutional neural networks
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unprecedented urbanization in particular in countries of the global south result in informal urban development processes, especially in mega cities. With an estimated 1 billion slum dwellers globally, the United Nations have made the fight against poverty the number one sustainable development goal. To provide better infrastructure and thus a better life to slum dwellers, detailed information on the spatial location and size of slums is of crucial importance. In the past, remote sensing has proven to be an extremely valuable and effective tool for mapping slums. The nature of used mapping approaches by machine learning, however, made it necessary to invest a lot of effort in training the models. Recent advances in deep learning allow for transferring trained fully convolutional networks (FCN) from one data set to another. Thus, in our study we aim at analyzing transfer learning capabilities of FCNs to slum mapping in various satellite images. A model trained on very high resolution optical satellite imagery from QuickBird is transferred to Sentinel-2 and TerraSAR-X data. While free-of-charge Sentinel 2 data is widely available, its comparably lower resolution makes slum mapping a challenging task. TerraSAR-X data on the other hand, has a higher resolution and is considered a powerful data source for infra-urban structure analysis. Due to the different image characteristics of SAR compared to optical data, however, transferring the model could not improve the performance of semantic segmentation but we observe very high accuracies for mapped slums in the optical data: QuickBird image obtains 86-88% (positive prediction value and sensitivity) and a significant increase for Sentinel-2 applying transfer learning can be observed (from 38 to 55% and from 79 to 85% for PPV and sensitivity, respectively). Using transfer learning proofs extremely valuable in retrieving information on small-scaled urban structures such as slum patches even in satellite images of decametric resolution.

TI  - Combining kernel-driven and fusion-based methods to generate daily high-spatial-resolution land surface temperatures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High-spatiotemporal-resolution land surface temperatures (LSTs) are required in various environmental applications. However, due to the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolutions in remote sensing, such data are still unavailable. Many studies have been conducted to resolve this dilemma, but difficulties remain in generating high-spatiotemporal-resolution (i.e., diurnal, e.g., 30 m resolution) LSTs. Accordingly, this study proposes a weighted combination of kernel-driven and fusion-based methods (termed CKFM) to enhance the resolution of time series LSTs; the kernel-driven process can obtain abundant spatial details from visible bands, while the fusion-based process is applied for its spatiotemporal prediction ability. CKFM contains three parts. First, a kernel-driven method is applied to predict high-resolution LSTs via a regression relationship between simulated medium-resolution LSTs and kernels. Second, a fusion-based method is applied to predict the medium-resolution LST, the result of which is used for thin plate spline (TPS) downscaling. Finally, the results of the kernel-driven and fusion-based processes are combined via weights calculated from error estimations. Compared with existing thermal sharpening methods, CKFM has the following strengths: (1) it fully utilizes the available visible and thermal bands from multiple sensors, thereby obtaining spatial details in a variety of ways; (2) it downscales LSTs in a dynamic manner; and (3) it is suitable for heterogeneous regions. CKFM is tested with Landsat 8 and MODIS data and successfully downscales the 1 km resolution MODIS LSTs into 30 m resolution data. In both visual and quantitative evaluations, CKFM is more accurate and robust than the kernel-driven method with an improvement of 0.1-0.6 K, and it reconstructs more spatial details than the fusion-based process. Based on these characteristics, CKFM is a promising method for generating daily high spatial resolution LSTs for various environmental studies.

TI  - A Study on Remote Sensing Inversion of Soil Salt Content in Arid Area Based on Thermal Infrared Spectrum
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil salinization has faced a serious threat to the ecological environment in arid areas, and it is of great significance to quantitative inversion of the salt content of soil by remote sensing technology. In this paper, we gathered the farmland soil and salt crystal in Ebinur lake watershed, to prepare into soil samples with different salt content (the proportion of salt and saline soil : 0.3%similar to 30%) in the laboratory. We measured the thermal infrared emissivity spectral of soil samples using 102F FTIR spectrometer, and through the Planck function fitting to obtain soil emissivity data, and then used the Gaussian filter method for smoothing emissivity curve to eliminate the background and noise effects. The saline soil emissivity spectral curve features were as bellow. The emissivity spectrum curve of soil with different salt content was basically consistent in shape and change tendency, and with the increase of salt content, the value of emissivity increased. Soil salinity factors had inhibitory effect on Reststrahlen absorption characteristics, which would be weakened with the increase of salt content, that presented as the depth of the asymmetric absorption valleys decreased, but the position and width changed a little. Based on the correlation analysis of emissivity and salt content, we found that : It was positively correlated between thermal infrared emissivity and salt content of soil, with the maximum correlation coefficient being 0.899, and the corresponding waveband 9.21 mu m; 8.2 similar to 10.5 mu m was the most sensitive wave bands for soil salinity. Using monadic linear regression, multiple stepwise regression and partial least square method to construct the prediction model, the value of R-2 were respectively 0.863, 0.879 and 0.958, and RMSE were respectively 3.853%, 3.334% and 1. 911%. It was proved that these three kinds of methods had certain prediction ability for salt content of soil, but partial least square was the best method. The thermal infrared wave bands of ASTER, Landsat8 and HJ-1B satellite sensors were chosen for the emissivity spectrum simulation according to the spectral response function of the sensor, and the correlation analysis results showed : ASTER's B10, B11 and B12 bands are sensitive to the salt factor with thermal infrared spectroscopy and have a high correlation with soil salinity, and their correlation coefficient are up to 0.706, 0.786 and 0.872 respectively. Furthermore, the prediction model of soil salt content based on ASTER thermal infrared wavebands was established through the multiple linear regression method, R-2 and RMSE of the predicted model was 0.833 and 3.895%. At last, the results showed that : it is feasible to quantitatively inverse salt content of saline soil by satellite thermal infrared remote sensing, which will provide a new way and reference for the remote sensing monitoring of soil salinization in arid areas.

TI  - Mapping Irrigated Areas of Northeast China in Comparison to Natural Vegetation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information about the location and extent of irrigation is fundamental to many aspects of food security and water resource management. This study develops a new method for identifying irrigation in northeastern China by comparing canopy moisture between the cropland and adjacent natural ecosystems (i.e., forests). This method is based on two basic assumptions, which we validated using field survey data. First, the canopy moisture of irrigated cropland, indicated by a satellite-based land surface water index (LSWI), is higher than that of the adjacent forest. Second, the difference in LSWI between irrigation cropland and forest is larger in arid regions than in humid regions. Based on the field survey and statistical dataset, our method performed well in indicating spatial variations of irrigated areas. Results from this study suggest that our method is a promising tool for mapping irrigated areas, as it is a general and repeatable method that does not rely on training samples and can be applied to other regions.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurately monitoring stand ages of deciduous rubber plantations is of great importance for ecological studies and plantations management. The re-establishment of rubber plantations usually experiences a short period (several years) of land clearance and transplantation of rubber seedlings, along with a noticeable landscape change from well-grown forest to bare land and sparse vegetation in situ. With Landsat times series (LTS) data of four commonly-used vegetation indices (VIs), namely the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and three non-visible spectral bands, i.e. the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR1/2), in this study, an approach by combining the inter-annual defoliating and foliating features of rubber trees and the intra-annual landscape changes of rubber plantations was presented to detect and map stand ages of deciduous rubber plantations in an anti-chronological manner across Xishuangbanna between 1987 and 2018, one of the most intensive regions of deciduous rubber plantations within the tropics. The approach highlighted the repeated distribution of newly-cleared and replanted plot (NCRP) of rubber seedlings due to rubber management. It applied the bi-temporal VIs thresholds of zero of NBR and NDMI during the defoliation to foliation phases to delineate the stand ages of deciduous rubber plantations at an interval of five years, by combining a Landsat-based rubber map in 2018 and 32-year NCRPs as well as quadri-classified age-groups and seven subcategories (i.e. <= 5 as infantile rubber plantations (IRP), 6-10 as young rubber plantations (YRP), 11-15 and 16-20 as mature rubber plantations (MRP), 21-25, 26-30, and >= 31 years as old rubber plantations (ORP)). The results showed that the areas of IRP, YRP, MRP, and ORP were 19.1 km(2), 817.1 km(2), 1681.7 km(2), and 573.7 km(2) in 2018, respectively. Spatially, the YRP are mainly around the outskirts of two county-level administrative centers (Jinghong and Mengla), while ORP primarily distributed along main roads. Nearly 53.9% of ORP, 51.8% of IRP, 47.3% of MRP and 46.3% of YRP were in Jinghong City, and Mengla County had 50.5% of YRP, 48.8% of MRP, 42.4% of IRP and 36.3% of ORP. This study demonstrates that the bi-temporal VIs thresholds method (i.e. NBRdefoliation < 0, NDMIdefoliation, < 0, NBRfoliation < 0, and NDMIfoliation, < 0) have great potential for detecting stand ages of deciduous rubber plantations.

TI  - Extraction and analysis of abandoned farmland: A case study of Qingyun and Wudi counties in Shandong Province
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and continuous loss of rural labor force has resulted in abandonment of large areas of farmland in some regions of China. Remote sensing technology can indirectly help detect abandoned farmland size and quantity, which is of great significance for farmland protection and food security. This study took Qingyun and Wudi counties in Shandong Province as a study area and used CART decision tree classification to compile land use maps of 1990-2017 based on Landsat and HJ-1A data. We developed rules to identify abandoned farmland, and explored its spatial distribution, duration, and reclamation. CART accuracy exceeded 85% from 1990-2017. The maximum abandoned farmland area was 5503.86 ha during 1992-2017, with the maximum rate being 5.37%. Farmland abandonment rate was the highest during 1996-1998, and abandonment trend decreased year by year after 2006. Maximum abandonment duration was 15 years (1992-2017), mostly within 4 years and only a few exceeded 10 years. From 1993-2017, the maximum reclaimed abandoned farmland was 2022.3 ha, and the minimum 20 ha. The maximum reclamation rate was 67.44%m, with annual average rate being 31.83%. This study will help analyze farmland abandonment driving forces in the study area and also provide references to identify abandoned farmland in other areas.

TI  - On the Use of Neumann Decomposition for Crop Classification Using Multi-Temporal RADARSAT-2 Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In previous studies, parameters derived from polarimetric target decompositions have proven as very effective features for crop classification with single/multi-temporal polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data. In particular, a classical eigenvalue-eigenvector-based decomposition approach named after Cloude-Pottier decomposition (or H/A/) has been frequently used to construct classification approaches. A model-based decomposition approach proposed by Neumann some years ago provides two parameters with very similar physical meanings to polarimetric scattering entropy H and the alpha angle in Cloude-Pottier decomposition. However, the main aim of the Neumann decomposition is to describe the morphological characteristics of vegetation. Therefore, it is worth investigating the performance of Neumann decomposition on crop classification, since vegetation is the principal type of targets in agricultural scenes. In this paper, a multi-temporal supervised classification method based on Neumann decomposition and Random Forest Classifier (named ND-RF) is proposed. The three parameters from Neumann decomposition, computed along the time series of data, are used as classification features. Finally, the Random Forest Classifier is applied for supervised classification. For comparison, an analogue classification scheme is constructed by replacing the Neumann decomposition with the Cloude-Pottier decomposition, hence named CP-RF. For validation, a time series of 11 polarimetric RADARSAT-2 SAR images acquired over an agricultural site in London, Ontario, Canada in 2015 is employed. Totally, 10 multi-temporal combinations of datasets were tested by adding images one by one sequentially along the SAR observation time. The results show that the ND-RF method generally produces better classification performance than the CP-RF method, with the largest improvement of over 12% in overall accuracy. Further tests show that the two parameters similar to entropy and alpha angle produce classification results close to those of CP-RF, whereas the third parameter in the Neumann decomposition is more effective in improving the classification accuracy with respect to the Cloude-Pottier decomposition.

TI  - Mapping daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> at 500 m resolution over Beijing with improved hazy day performance
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) to infer surface PM2.5 has significantly increased the spatial coverage and resolutions (1-10 km) of ground-level PM2.5 mapping as required for accurate exposure estimation. The remaining challenge is to further increase the mapping resolution to the sub-km level with improved algorithms to minimize misrepresentation of severe haze as clouds. In this study, we provide the first daily PM2.5 estimation over Beijing at a 500 m resolution using AOD from the Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm( SARA) and linear mixed effects model. A novel cloud screenmethod is developed which significantly improves data availability during hazy days. The cross-validation R-2 for PM2.5 estimations is 0.82 with the cloud-screened SARA AOD. Based on the satellite-predicted high-resolution PM2.5 map, all-day population-weighted PM2.5 is estimated to be 81.4 mu g m(-3) over Beijing (2.3 times higher than China's NAAQS of 35 mu g m(-3)). Compared to the standard MODIS Dark Target 3 km product which presents a significant percentage of missing data, the 500 m resolution PM2.5 mapping derived from SARA AOD reveals distinct pollution patterns and population exposure conditions during severe hazy days, thereby providing valuable information for pollution control and epidemiological studies.

TI  - Coseismic and Postseismic Deformation of the 2016 <i>M<sub>W</sub></i> 6.2 Lampa Earthquake, Southern Peru, Constrained by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We use Sentinel-1 radar imagery to explore the coseismic and postseismic surface displacements associated with the 2016 M-W 6.2 Lampa earthquake in southern Peru. Based on coseismic interferograms, the preferred slip model links to a blind south southeast striking, south southwest dipping normal fault with a shallow dip (45.2 degrees) and a peak slip of 0.71m at depth 5.3km, which is consistent with seismic solutions. Postseismic interferograms, derived from two tracks of the Sentinel-1A/B satellites using a small baseline subset method, show subsidence up to 3cm in the first year after the mainshock. The kinematic inversions of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations imply that the postseismic surface displacements observed in 1year after the earthquake are governed by afterslip occurring along the updip extension of the coseismic slip patches. To further improve the data fitting, we generate a fault with variable strike to refine the kinematic afterslip model. The stress-driven afterslip forward modeling shows that the postseismic deformation is controlled by afterslip distributed at the edge of the compact coseismic slip area. The surface displacement predictions of the poroelastic rebound show subsidence of the hanging wall, but the magnitude of the displacements is small compared to the observed signal. We as well test a collection of viscoelastic relaxation models and find that the predicted surface displacements are not consistent with the observations. The InSAR results show that the strike of the seismogenic fault is quasi-parallel to the Vilcanota normal fault system and both the fault associated with earthquake and Vilcanota normal fault dip in the same direction. Therefore, we suspect that the causative fault of this 2016 event may be a normal fault belonging to a domino faulting system.

TI  - Study of dissolved oxygen responses to tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal based on Argo and satellite observations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Effects of tropical cyclones (TCs) on dissolved oxygen (DO) in subsurface waters (20-200 m) over the Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) are examined based on Argo and satellite data. Five TCs (Hudhud, Five, Vardah, Maarutha and Mora) during 2013-2018 are considered. Analyses reveal three types of DO temporal variability caused by the storm-induced mixing and upwelling. The first type features temporal DO increases in subsurface waters (37-70 m) caused mainly by intense vertical mixing and downwelling. The second type features DO reductions in subsurface waters after the storms attributed to storm-induced upwelling. The third type features temporal DO increases at depths between 40 and 79 m and decreases at depths between 80 and 150 m due to the combined effect of strong vertical mixing and upwelling. These three types of DO responses can occur in different areas, depending on TC intensity, translational speed and Ekman pumping. The temporal DO variability is also influenced by the shallow oxycline (58.3 +/- 16.7 m), mesoscale eddies and biochemical processes. Due to TC intensification, a pre-existing oceanic cyclonic eddy produced a large upwelling and induced a long time of DO decrease in the subsurface layer. This study suggests three different types of DO responses along the TC track in the OMZ, which is useful to evaluate the influence of TCs on the OMZ. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Retrieving leaf chlorophyll content using a matrix-based vegetation index combination approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(Leaf)), which is responsible for light harvesting for photosynthesis, is an important parameter for carbon cycle modeling and agriculture monitoring at regional and global scales. Since the spectral signals of chlorophyll content and leaf area are highly coupled, it is required to remove the effect of the LAI on the retrieval of Chl(Leaf) from satellite data. In this paper, an approach for the retrieval of Chl(Leaf) was proposed. A 2-dimensional matrix-based relationship between Chl(Leaf) and two VIs was established using simulated datasets from the PROSAIL model. The matrix was formed by dividing the two-VI space into m x n cells and assigning the Chl(Leaf) value to each cell. Based on the matrix, the Chl(Leaf) can be retrieved using the two VIs from observations. Three matrices of different VI pairs for retrieving Chl(Leaf) were tested using the PROSAIL simulated data. The results show that the matrix formed with two new VIs, RERI[705] and RERI[783], works best. The results from the matrices of two VIs are better than those from individual VIs as well as from VI ratios. The matrices were successfully used to retrieve the Chl(Leaf) of winter wheat from Sentinel-2 images. The Chl(Leaf) estimations using the RERI[705]-RERI[783] matrix achieves an accuracy of R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 10.4 mu g/cm(2), and NRMSE = 11.9%. The estimations using the TCARI-OSAVI and the R-740/R-705-R-865/R-665 matrices are also in good agreement with the measured Chl(Leaf) (R-2 > 0.48, RMSE < 13.1 mu g/cm(2), and NRMSE < 15.1%). The matrix-based VI combination approach has the potential for the operational retrieval of Chl(Leaf) from multispectral satellite data.

TI  - Study on clues for gold prospecting in the Maizijing-Shulonggou area, Ningxia Hui autonomous region, China, using ALI, ASTER and WorldView-2 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Several gold occurrences have been discovered in the Maizijing-Shulonggou area, Ningxia Hui autonomous region, China. The clues for gold prospecting in this area may relate to fractures and hydrothermal alterations, but it is very difficult to conduct a field investigation on the clues because of the alpine valleys. To explore the clues for gold prospecting, this study extracted geological information related to fracture zones and hydrothermal alterations using ALI, ASTER, and WorldView-2 data, and subsequently, explored potential relationships between extracted geological characteristics and gold mineralization. The WorldView-2 image in the study area was used for fracture interpretation. The azimuth and density of linear fractures were investigated, and the results showed that linear fractures with NE direction were most common, the gold occurrences except Au2 were all located in NE fracture zones, and all gold occurrences located in high fracture density areas (level 1-3 areas) where NE and NW fractures were the most common observations. This suggests that the high fracture density and NE and NW fractures are important indicators of potential gold mineralization. Hydrothermal alteration minerals in exposed bedrocks were mapped using ALI and ASTER imagery. Based on the spectral analysis, ASTER image in the study area were used to map quartz, illite and chlorite, while ALI image were used to map limonite. The spatial distribution of alteration minerals revealed regional specific alteration mineral in gold mineralization. In the northern Maizijing region, the composition of alteration mineral in the surrounding of Aul was overwhelmed by quartz, while the alteration minerals in the surrounding of Aug-4 were dominated by limonite in the southern Shulonggou region, which showed different indicator minerals for gold prospecting in the two regions. As a result, the key areas for prospecting are the NE and NW fracture zones with quartz veins in the Maizijing region and the NE and NW fracture zones with limonitization in the Shulonggou region. In the Shulonggou region, pyrite in buried quartz-pyritization belt and illitization-pyritization belt is likely to be the precursor of limonite. Heavy mineral assemblages were analyzed for native gold content, and the results suggested high native gold content in the illitization-pyritization belt, followed by quartz-pyritization belt, which was consistent with the strong association of limonite and gold mineralization, thus the two belts shall be prioritized for gold prospecting in the Shulonggou region.

AB  - An 83-year-old woman received 8 courses of chemotherapy(mogamulizumab)for adult T cell leukemia in the hematolo- gy department of our hospital, after which she achieved complete remission and was followed up with chemotherapy(VP/ MST: sobuzoxane/etoposide)as an outpatient. Later, diarrheal symptoms appeared, and detailed examinations led to a diagnosis of cancer of the ascending colon. Although no distal metastasis was found, breast cancer was also revealed in the C area of the right breast. The general status of the patient was favorable; thus, right pectoral muscle-conserving mastectomy and concomitant sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed through laparoscope-assisted extended right hemicolectomy. The postoperative course was favorable, and she was discharged on hospital day 7. The excised tumors were pathologically diagnosed as stageⅠ breast cancer and stage Ⅲa colorectal cancer. Chemotherapy(VP/MST)was administered without adjuvant chemotherapy. Presently, 18 months after surgery, complete remission of adult T cell leukemia has been maintained, without metastasis and recurrence of cancer of the ascending colon and breast cancer.

AB  - The tropical forest system of Xishuangbanna is of important value in global forest system, because it is the only green island in the tropical desert belt and the largest intact best-preserved tropical rain forest in China. Discovering the relationship between the tropical forest biomass of Xishuangbanna and Landsat TM data is very important for depicting the tropical forest biomass by using remote sensing. The study aimed to (1) discover the relationship between tropical forest biomass and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images in Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China, by using forest permanent plot data and correlation analysis; (2) explore how to improve the relationship by using topographic correction models such as the Lambert cosine correction model (LCCM) and the sun-canopy-sensor topographic correction model (SCSTCM). The results revealed the tropical forest biomass characteristics and the relationship characteristics between the tropical forest biomass and Landsat TM data and its improvement by using LCCM and SCSTCM. The results are beneficial to monitoring the tropical forest biomass variation in Xishuangbanna.

TI  - Assessing climate impact on forest cover in areas undergoing substantial land cover change using Landsat imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we propose to assess climate impact on forest cover (represented by EVI) at multiple scales in areas undergoing substantial land cover change, using Landsat imagery with human-induced land cover change effect excluded. Taking the Qingliu River catchment located in a subtropical humid monsoon area in China as a case study, the results indicate that EVI increases significantly (p < 0.01) during 1989-2014 with a magnitude of 0.026/decade. Spatial distribution of EVI is distinct in summer and growing season. Temperature and precipitation show high partial correlations with EVI, with better partial correlation found between EVI and temperature. Their partial correlations with EVI on monthly scale are higher than those on annual scale. Besides, precipitation and pan evaporation show accumulative lag effects (4 months) on forest EVI, while temperature has no lag effect. Finally, an empirical formula is established to quantify the relationship among EVI and its main driving factors (temperature and precipitation) by considering the precipitation threshold (200 mm). The findings should provide scientific supports for local forest management and ecosystem services, and should also support the hydrological effect assessment of vegetation cover change under climate change for the study area.

TI  - Land surface characterization using BeiDou signal-to-noise ratio observations
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) is providing new opportunities for GNSS reflectometry-related applications. We give the first and comprehensive description of the feasibility and potential of using BDS signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data to characterize land surface in terms of the volumetric soil moisture (VSM), vegetation water content (VWC) and snow depth. BDS SNR-derived interferogram metrics (phase phi, amplitude A, and effective reflector height h) are investigated, and their correlations to the corresponding land surface parameters are established. Data collected from a geodetic-quality BDS/GPS compatible receiver for approximately 300-day period were used to validate the VSM retrieval. Results show that both BDS B1 and B2 frequencies can perform well to reflect the fluctuations of the VSM. Specifically, the B2-derived phase phi exhibits a slightly higher correlation with in situ VSM than that of B1 (R=0.83 vs. R=0.80), and the B2-derived amplitude A also exhibits a higher correlation with MODIS NDVI than that of B1 (R=0.49 vs. R=0.53); whilst for snow, the B1 and B2 results indicate qualitative agreement with concurrent in situ snow depth measurements. Furthermore, similar estimation performance can be obtained by comparing the results of BDS B1 and B2 against GPS L2C and L5. Therefore, BDS could be a new and powerful data source with comparable potential as GPS for effectively characterizing high-temporal resolution land surface.

T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016 M-w 6.0 Hutubi earthquake occurred in the northern Tien Shan fold-and-thrust belts, China. However, the coseismic fault rupture model and the seismotectonics of the 2016 Hutubi earthquake remain uncertain up to the present due to the small magnitude, deep hypocenter, and no surface rupture caused by the seismogenic fault. Here, we show the evidence that the 2016 Hutubi earthquake occurred on a deep (15-20 km) blind-thrust fault, and the rupture of the blind fault triggers the slip of a shallow overlying fold. Ascending and descending Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations captured by Sentinel-1A/1B satellites are used to construct the seismogenic structure of the 2016 Hutubi earthquake. It is found that a single fault fails to provide a good fit to the observed Sentinel-1 ascending and descending InSAR deformation. A shallow fault-bend fold with strike along the surface trace of the Qigu anticline and a varying dip angle along the down-dip direction is proposed in this study based on the geodetic observations, which significantly improves the model fit to the InSAR observations. The estimated faulting model shows that the 2016 Hutubi earthquake occurred on a deep blind fault with 264.4 degrees strike and 28.8 degrees dip, and significant fault slip is located at the depth of 13-18 km with a peak slip of similar to 10.0 cm. The triggered shallow fault-bend fold has a listric surface with slight predominant thrust slip. The static Coulomb stress change from the mainshock on the shallow fold structure is negative, which indicates the dynamic stress may play a more important role than the static stress in the triggering of the shallow fault-bend fold in this case. The result of this study suggests that a moderate earthquake with a deep hypocenter has the potential to trigger the rupture of the shallow overlying fault-bend fold in this zone.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation Characteristics of Ecosystem Service Losses in the Agro-Pastoral Ecotone of Northern China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Being subject to climate change and human intervention, the land-use pattern in the agro-pastoral ecotone of Northern China has undergone complex changes over the past few decades, which may jeopardize the provision of ecosystem services. Thus, for sustainable land management, ecosystem services should be evaluated and monitored. In this study, based on Landsat TM/ETM data, we quantitatively evaluated the losses of ecosystem service values (ESV) in three sections of the agro-pastoral ecotone from 1980-2015. The results were as follows: (1) the main characteristic of the land conversions was that a large area of grassland was converted into cultivated land in the agro-pastoral ecotone; (2) on the spatial scale, the ESV losses of the agro-pastoral ecotone can be called an inclined surface in the direction of the northeast to southwest, and the northeastern section of the agro-pastoral ecotone lost more ESV than the middle and northwest sections (p < 0.05), on the temporal scale, the order of losses was 1990-2000 > 1980-1990 > 2000-2015; (3) the agro-pastoral ecotone lost more ESV, which was mainly due to four kinds of land conversion, which were grassland that was transformed into cultivated land, grassland transformed into unused land, grassland transformed into built-up areas, and cultivated land transformed into built-up areas; (4) although these land conversions were curbed after the implementation of protection policies at the end of the 1990s, due to reduced precipitation and increasing temperatures, the agro-pastoral ecotone will face a more severe situation in the future; and, (5) during the period of 1990-2015, the overall dynamic processes of increasing population gradually expanded to the sparsely populated pastoral area. Therefore, we believe that human interventions are the main cause of ecological deterioration in the agro-pastoral ecotone. This study provides references for fully understanding the regional differences in the ecological and environmental effects of land use change and it helps to objectively evaluate ecological civilization construction in the agro-pastoral ecotone of Northern China.

TI  - Estimating Daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations in Beijing Using 750-M VIIRS IP AOD Retrievals and a Nested Spatiotemporal Statistical Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) data have been widely used to predict PM2.5 concentrations. Most of their spatial resolutions (1 km or greater), however, are too coarse to support PM2.5-related studies at fine scales (e.g., urban-scale PM2.5 exposure assessments). Space-time regression models have been widely developed and applied to predict PM2.5 concentrations from satellite-retrieved AOD. Their accuracies, however, are not satisfactory particularly on days that lack a model dataset. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of recent high-resolution (i.e., 750 m at nadir) AOD obtained from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite instrument (VIIRS) Intermediate Product (IP) in estimating PM2.5 concentrations with a newly developed nested spatiotemporal statistical model. The nested spatiotemporal statistical model consisted of two parts: a nested time fixed effects regression (TFER) model and a series of geographically weighted regression (GWR) models. The TFER model, containing daily, weekly, or monthly intercepts, used the VIIRS IP AOD as the main predictor alongside several auxiliary variables to predict daily PM2.5 concentrations. Meanwhile, the series of GWR models used the VIIRS IP AOD as the independent variable to correct residuals from the first-stage nested TFER model. The average spatiotemporal coverage of the VIIRS IP AOD was approximately 16.12%. The sample-based ten-fold cross validation goodness of fit (R-2) for the first-stage TFER models with daily, weekly, and monthly intercepts were 0.81, 0.66, and 0.45, respectively. The second-stage GWR models further captured the spatial heterogeneities of the PM2.5-AOD relationships. The nested spatiotemporal statistical model produced more daily PM2.5 estimates and improved the accuracies of summer, autumn, and annual PM2.5 estimates. This study contributes to the knowledge of how well VIIRS IP AOD can predict PM2.5 concentrations at urban scales and offers strategies for improving the coverage and accuracy of daily PM2.5 estimates on days that lack a model dataset.

TI  - Increased spatial heterogeneity in vegetation greenness due to vegetation greening in mainland China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial heterogeneity in vegetation greenness (VG) can influence earth surface process and resource ecology. However, its long-term change and driving forces remain poorly understood. In this study, MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data was used to examine the change in spatial heterogeneity in VG and its relationships with vegetation greening in mainland China during 2000-2017. Moving window standard deviation and range of growing season mean EVI (GSEVI) were used as proxies for spatial heterogeneity in VG. It was found that moving window standard deviation of GSEVI increased significantly over 33.8% to 53.7% of mainland China during 2000-2017, while it decreased significantly over less than 5% of mainland China. The results of moving window range of GSEVI were similar to moving window standard deviation of GSEVI. These may be explained by: (1) increased standard deviation and range of GSEVI accompanied by increased GSEVI value; and (2) faster greening speed in dense than in sparse vegetated areas. Additionally, the increased spatial heterogeneity in VG means the increased difference in VG between arid and humid regions, and between urban cores (UCs) and rural areas. These may primarily be attributed to slower greening speed in arid than in humid regions, and in UCs than in rural areas. Thus some benefits from vegetation greening may be much less in arid than in humid regions, and in UCs than in rural areas. Overall, this study analyzed an interesting phenomenon that vegetation greening may increase spatial heterogeneity in VG, which has a series of implications for environment and human activities.

TI  - Advance in Agricultural Drought Monitoring Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, frequent agricultural droughts not only seriously affect regional food security and ecological security, but also threaten social economic stability and sustainable development in the context of global warming. Using remote sensing technology to monitor agricultural drought is an important way to prevent the occurrence and development of agricultural drought, which can provide a strong support for people to develop scientific management measures. Hence, understanding the current progress in studies related to the agricultural drought monitoring based on remote sensing data has importance and practical significance in the quantitative evaluation of agricultural drought and promotion of sustainable social and economic development. In this paper, we first introduced the concepts of the drought and agricultural drought and main research methods. Secondly, we reviewed the progress of research on the agricultural drought monitoring by remote sensing, especially in monitoring indices and its methods. The monitoring indices based on remote sensing were classified into three categories: reflecting rainfall change, reflecting soil moisture change and reflecting crop water balance. Beside this, microwave remote sensing monitoring method, multispectral, near infrared and thermal infrared remote sensing monitoring method and hyperspectral remote sensing monitoring method which are sensitive to moisture change were selected to summarize the advance in monitor agricultural drought research by analyzing the two typical land use types of soil and vegetation. The limitations and applicability of different methods for each category were systematically summarized and described. Thirdly, the existing bottlenecks and difficulties in current research were discussed. Finally, in order to provide a reference for quantitative monitoring and analysis of the agricultural drought, the future research directions were equally proposed.

TI  - Understanding the complex seasonality of seasonal influenza A and B virus transmission: Evidence from six years of surveillance data in Shanghai, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Understanding the complexity of influenza subtype seasonality is critical to promoting a suitable vaccination program. The aim of this study was to identify and compare the seasonality and epidemiological features of seasonal influenza subtypes after the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic and to lay a foundation for further investigation into the social and environmental factors affecting seasonal influenza virus transmission.Methods: Influenza-like illness (ILI) case surveillance was conducted in two sentinel hospitals in Pudong New Area, Shanghai between 2012 and 2018. Weekly data on ILI cases were analyzed. A time-series seasonal decomposition analysis was used to reveal the seasonality of influenza and epidemiological features among different subtypes.Results: In total, 10 977 ILI patients were enrolled of whom 2385 (21.7%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza. Compared to influenza A (16.3%), influenza B (5.4%) was less frequently detected among the ILI patients (p < 0.001). Semiannual epidemic peaks were identified in four of the years during the 6-year study period, while only one annual epidemic peak was found in the other two years. An epidemic peak occurred in each winter season, and a secondary peak also occasionally occurred in summer or spring. A/H3N2 predominated in both summer and winter, while A/H1N1, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria circulated almost exclusively in winter or spring. Two lineages of influenza B seemed to predominate in alternating years.Conclusions: This study highlights the complexity of seasonal influenza virus activity in a subtropical region of China, presenting both semiannual and annual epidemic peaks in different years. The results of this study may provide further insight into possible improvements in the timing of influenza vaccination in Shanghai, China. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Net primary productivity dynamics and associated hydrological driving factors in the floodplain wetland of China's largest freshwater lake
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are thought to be the most unique ecosystem in the world which plays an important role in water and material circulation. However, investigation of ecosystem dynamics in those lake floodplain wetlands that suffering rapid and significant short-term water level fluctuation is quite a challenge. In this study, the short-and long-term characteristics of vegetation NPP (net primary productivity) and their driving mechanism were investigated in the Poyang Lake floodplain wetland, an important international wetland that listed in the Global Eco-region by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Attempts were achieved through validating the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model based on observed biomasses of different vegetation types and reconstructed continuous high spatiotemporal resolution (30 m and 16 days) of NDVI data during 2000-2015 according to the fused Landsat and MODIS data. Major result indicates that the intra-annual variation of NPP of most vegetation types shows two peaks in a year due to combined effects of vegetation growth rhythm and seasonal exposure of the lake floodplain. Annual NPP of the lake floodplain ranges in 360.09-735.94 gC/m2 and shows an increasing trend during the study period. The change of NPP in space indicates that the distribution elevation of the major vegetation types decreased and evoluted toward the center lake floodplain. Different from the terrestrial ecosystem, inundation duration is the dominant factor that controls NPP dynamics in the lake floodplain, while the influences of other meteorological factors are much weakened. Recent decline of lake water level was the major reason for the spatio-temporal evolution of annual and seasonal vegetation NPP in the lake floodplain. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long-term flood-hazard modeling for coastal areas using InSAR measurements and a hydrodynamic model: The case study of Lingang New City, Shanghai
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we study long-term coastal flood risk of Lingang New City, Shanghai, considering 100- and 1000-year coastal flood return periods, local seal-level rise projections, and long-term ground subsidence projections. TanDEM-X satellite data acquired in 2012 were used to generate a high-resolution topography map, and multi-sensor InSAR displacement time-series were used to obtain ground deformation rates between 2007 and 2017. Both data sets were then used to project ground deformation rates for the 2030s and 2050s. A 2-D flood inundation model (FloodMap-Inertial) was employed to predict coastal flood inundation for both scenarios. The results suggest that the sea-level rise, along with land subsidence, could result in minor but non-linear impacts on coastal inundation over time. The flood risk will primarily be determined by future exposure and vulnerability of population and property in the floodplain. Although the flood risk estimates show some uncertainties, particularly for long-term predictions, the methodology presented here could be applied to other coastal areas where sea level rise and land subsidence are evolving in the context of climate change and urbanization.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Scarcity of water in arid and hyper-arid environments is one of the main challenges that hinder the development of such areas. Therefore, the main study objective is to introduce a comprehensive scientific approach based on remote sensing data and geoinformatic applications in combination with field investigations to extract inferences for groundwater exploration in a remote data-scarce pilot area (El-Kubanyia basin). The measured composite section has thickness 410 m where the geologic exposures are represented from Upper Cretaceous to Quaternary age. The Quaternary aquifer has limited exploration where it was penetrated by 16 wells (depths ranging between 23 and 210 m, salinity between 775 and 3142 mg/l), while Nubian sandstone does not explored yet. The porosity and permeability are evaluated for Nubian group through blue dye staining thin sections and reveal high capabilities to bear and sore groundwater. The photogeologic structural lineaments of El-Kubanyia basin include sets of fracture and/or faults (NE-SW, NW-SE and E-W) where two faults are connecting between Naser Lake and Nubian group in El-Kubanyia basin. The magnetotelluric and gravity data clarified that the basin outlet is a graben filled with post-Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. The integration between the obtained geological structures with data derived from remote sensing investigations, are used to design five conceptual models simulate the opportunities for recharging the Quaternary and Nubian sandstone aquifers and identify the different recharge sources such as; Nile River, Nasser Lake, and paleo-precipitation in past wet periods. Finally, a future perspective strategy for groundwater exploration was presented.

TI  - The response of cyclonic eddies to typhoons based on satellite remote sensing data for 2001-2014 from the South China Sea
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Eddies are known to be affected by typhoons, and in recent years, the general three-dimensional structure, as well as features of the spatial and temporal distributions of eddies have been determined. However, the type of eddy that is most likely to be affected by a typhoon remains unclear. In this paper, quantitative and qualitative methods were used to study the eddies that are most sensitive to upper-ocean tropical cyclones (TCs) from the perspective of eddy characteristics, and the quantitative results showed that not all eddies were enhanced under the influence of typhoons. Enhancement of the eddy amplitude (Amp), radius (Rad), area (A), or eddy kinetic energy (EKE) accounted for 92.3% of the total eddy within the radius of the typhoon. Qualitative analyses showed the following: First, eddies located on different sides of the typhoon tracks were differently affected, as eddies on the left side were more intensely affected by the typhoon than eddies on the right side, and second, eddies with short lifespans or small radii were more susceptible to the TCs.

TI  - Urban expansion in Shenzhen since 1970s: A retrospect of change from a village to a megacity from the space
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the characteristic of urban expansion is the prerequisite of understanding its social and ecological outcomes. Here, using Shenzhen, a city that grew from a fishery village to a megacity in 40 years as a case study, we quantified the urban expansion at two scales, over the entire city and within the city, at district level. Twelve land cover maps from 1979 to 2017 were classified using Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images. Based on the long-term map series, we examined the impacts of urban expansion on land cover change, and the directional variations of those change trajectories. Our results demonstrated that: (1) Shenzhen experienced rapid and dramatic urban expansion from 1979 to 2017. The developed land increased by 3400%, from 27 km(2) to 946 km(2) with an average annual growth of 24 km(2). While the developed land continued to increase, its expansion rate exhibited a general decreasing trend, except for the time period of 1990-1995. (2) The urban expansion primarily consumed forest, water, and farmland. Forest experienced a 44% loss from 1979 to 2017, equals 659 km(2) of land. (3) The urban expansion exhibited distinctive directional variations from the southwest to the northeast, following a "fan" model. The within city differences are potentially related to changes of regional geographical conditions. In the western coastal area, water experienced major changes, and in the northern region forest had the most lost. The understanding of urban expansion variations within the city will help local government in designing and implementing effective plans that balancing future urban development and ecological conservation.

TI  - Trends of sea surface temperature and sea surface temperature fronts in the South China Sea during 2003-2017
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The trends of the sea surface temperature (SST) and SST fronts in the South China Sea (SCS) are analyzed during 2003-2017 using high-resolution satellite data. The linear trend of the basin averaged SST is 0.31 degrees C per decade, with the strongest warming identified in southeastern Vietnam. Although the rate of warming is comparable in summer and winter for the entire basin, the corresponding spatial patterns of the linear trend are substantially different between them. The SST trend to the west of the Luzon Strait is characterized by rapid warming in summer, exceeding approximately 0.6 degrees C per decade, but the trend is insignificant in winter. The strongest warming trend occurs in the southeast of Vietnam in winter, with much less pronounced warming in summer. A positive trend of SST fronts is identified for the coast of China and is associated with increasing wind stress. The increasing trend of SST fronts is also found in the east of Vietnam. Large-scale circulation, such as El Nino, can influence the trends of the SST and SST fronts. A significant correlation is found between the SST anomaly and Nino3.4 index, and the ENSO signal leads by eight months. The basin averaged SST linear trends increase after the El Nino event (2009-2010), which is, at least, due to the rapid warming rate causing by the enhanced northeasterly wind. Peaks of positive anomalous SST and negatively anomalous SST fronts are found to co-occur with the strong El Nino events.

TI  - Spatiotemporal differentiation of vegetation coverage in Qinhe Basin
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - With four images of Landsat TM/OLI as data sources, fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) in Qinhe Basin was estimated by dimidiating pixel model, and the spatiotemporal changes of vegetation patterns from 1993 to 2016 were analyzed using transition matrix, geo-spectrum and center of gravity migration model. The spatial variation of FVC at different attitudes, slopes, and aspects were explored based on topographic factors. The results showed that, spatially, FVC was higher in the north and lower in the south, and the vegetation with higher FVC was mainly transformed from those with lower FVC. During 1993-2016, the FVC in the Qinhe Basin showed an increasing trend with no significant fluctuation. The sum of areas with significant improvement (55.99%) and slight improvement (10.13%) were greater than that of areas with significant degradation (7.31%) and slight degradation (4.59%), reflecting good vegetation conditions. The center of gravity for FVC was migrated toward the southeast with 2.05 km, with the migrations of higher and highest FVC being the most obvious. FVC values were significantly positively correlated with elevation and slope. The area with remarkable improvement increased and then decreased with elevation and slope. The favorable terrain of vegetation in aspect was the area of the northeast, northwest and southwest. Our results will be helpful to the control of soil and water losses and ecological restoration in the study area.

TI  - Surgical Management of the Axilla in Breast Cancer Patients with Negative Sentinel Lymph Node: A Method to Reduce False-Negative Rate
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFalse-negative rate (FNR) of sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) has not been eliminated. The study was conducted to optimize the surgical resection of axilla in patients with negative sentinel lymph node (SLN) for the purpose of eradicating false-negative (FN) events of SLND.MethodsA total of 312 clinically node-negative patients without neoadjuvant therapy underwent SLND with indocyanine green (ICG), methylene blue and the combination of ICG and methylene blue. Axillary dissection was performed subsequently regardless of the status of SLN. Lymph nodes were sent for pathological examination separately by serial resection every 0.5cm away from marginally visualized SLNs.ResultsSLND was successfully conducted in 98.1% (306/312) of patients using methylene blue, ICG, and its combination. Further examination revealed 97 true-positive, 189 true-negative, and 13 FN results. The overall FNR was 11.8% (13/110). A horizontal line 1.5cm away from the superior vSLN and a vertical line 1.5cm away from the medial vSLN formed a zone of lower outer quadrant (LOQ) in axilla. Surgical resection of LOQ en bloc' showed a FNR of zero.ConclusionsThe surgical management of axilla may benefit negative SLN patients with potential nodal involvement, reducing the FNR of SLND to zero.Trial registration number and agencyThis study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1800014247).

TI  - Responses of Ecosystem Services to Urbanization-Induced Land Use Changes in Ecologically Sensitive Suburban Areas in Hangzhou, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecologically sensitive suburban areas provide important ecosystem services and protect urban ecological security because of their multiple functions in natural and human systems. The research on the ecological environment effects of land use activities in ecologically sensitive suburban areas is important in guiding the healthy and sustainable development of cities. Taking the west suburbs of Hangzhou in China as a case study, we quantified land use changes from Landsat satellite imagery and calculated the value of ecosystem services using the well-established equivalent factor table for land use/cover change (LUCC) and ecosystem services value (ESV). The impacts of LUCC on the ecological environment were analyzed using the transfer matrix of land use and coefficient of elasticity. Results revealed the following. (1) The total ESV in the western suburban area of Hangzhou decreased from $109.95 million in 2000 to $87.09 million in 2016. Moreover, the ESV of gas regulation, climate regulation, soil formation and protection, as well as biodiversity conservation presented a large decrease of more than 25%, especially between 2010 and 2016. (2) The spatial distribution of ESV was high in the west and low in the east. The regions with a significant reduction in ESV were mainly distributed in the eastern town of Wuchang and in Jincheng Town located in the midwest valley. (3) Industrial agglomeration activities in the ecologically sensitive suburban area emerged as the primary factor influencing ESV for various land uses. The elasticity indicator for assessing the responses to ESV changes relative to LUCC showed that 1% of the land conversion in this area resulted in average changes in ESV of 4.1% after the establishment of the industrial agglomeration area. (4) The increase in construction land was associated with a significant decrease in forest area because of the policy of cultivated land requisition-compensation balance and development strategies for low-slope hilly lands. Consequently, the ESV in the ecologically sensitive suburban areas rapidly declined.

TI  - Automated Mapping of Convective Clouds (AMCC) Thermodynamical, Microphysical, and CCN Properties from <i>SNPP</i>/VIIRS Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The advent of the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi NPP (SNPP) satellite made it possible to retrieve a new class of convective cloud properties and the aerosols that they ingest. An automated mapping system of retrieval of some properties of convective cloud fields over large areas at the scale of satellite coverage was developed and is presented here. The system is named Automated Mapping of Convective Clouds (AMCC). The input is level-1 VIIRS data and meteorological gridded data. AMCC identifies the cloudy pixels of convective elements; retrieves for each pixel its temperature T and cloud drop effective radius r(e); calculates cloud-base temperature T-b based on the warmest cloudy pixels; calculates cloud-base height H-b and pressure P-b based on T-b and meteorological data; calculates cloud-base updraft W-b based on H-b; calculates cloud-base adiabatic cloud drop concentrations N-d,N-a based on the T-r(e) relationship, T-b, and P-b; calculates cloud-base maximum vapor supersaturation S based on N-d,N-a and W-b; and defines N-d,N-a/1.3 as the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration N-CCN at that S. The results are gridded 36 km x 36 km data points at nadir, which are sufficiently large to capture the properties of a field of convective clouds and also sufficiently small to capture aerosol and dynamic perturbations at this scale, such as urban and land-use features. The results of AMCC are instrumental in observing spatial covariability in clouds and CCN properties and for obtaining insights from such observations for natural and man-made causes. AMCC-generated maps are also useful for applications from numerical weather forecasting to climate models.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF OCEANOGRAPHIC FACTORS ON SKIPJACK TUNA FAD VS FREE SCHOOL CATCH IN THE BONE BAY, INDONESIA: AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD FISHING MANAGEMENT
T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aims of this study were to compare skipjack catch between FAD and free school fishing grounds and to describe the effect of the oceanographic factors on either skipjack tuna Fish Aggregating Device (FAD) or free school. We used a field survey method for collecting the skipjack catch and the fishing positions for both near FAD and free school areas. Remotely sensed satellite data of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) were also used to extract the oceanographic data corresponding with both the fishing locations. To find out the vital oceanographic factors, we examined the characteristics of the oceanographic variables and skipjack catch using t-test. Results indicated that the fishing operations of skipjack tuna at FAD tended to locate areas of relatively higher Chl-a than at free school locations. We also found that skipjack tuna catch was higher near the FAD than the other area, where the Chl-a was the most significant factor that affected the difference. This study suggests that the number of skipjack tuna FAD in the coastal waters of Bone Bay should be calculated accurately to ensure and support the tuna fishing management in that study area.

TI  - Weakly-coupled geo-statistical mapping of soil salinity to Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression of MODIS spectral image products
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating remote sensing and geo-statistical techniques are of expanding field of researches, for soil salinity mapping taking advantage of steadily improving technology for the remote and proximal sensing of land features at the terrain surface. The main objective of the research is to enhance the performance of soil salinity mapping by employing MODIS spectral products and results of laboratory soil analysis into a geo-statistical soil properties analysis. The study area is the Sarvestan region, located in the southeast of Shiraz, Iran. The research followed a stratified random cluster sampling approach for collecting 240 soil samples in 60 geo-referenced soil pits from top of bare soils (5-10 cm). The MODIS data sets used were acquired during soil sampling. Stepwise multiple linear regression (SLMR) was employed for selecting MODIS products, that carry the most information on soil factors. Geo-statistical methods including Ordinary Kriging (OK), Co-kriging (CK), and Regression Kriging (RK) were used in mapping soil properties. Statistical criteria were considered to validate the models developed by SMLR. RK and OK as they are the best in EC and pH prediction. RK presents a higher effectiveness for the soil variables than CK, and confirms the usefulness of coupling SMLR to geostatistical mapping processes. The results indicate that MODIS imageries improve the capability of geostatistical methods for soil salinity mapping. The results showed that the use of MODIS imageries increased the G-Values of RK by 13%, 5%, 3%, 7% and 1% on average for OM, SAR, Na, K, and Mg respectively. RK also showed a good competitiveness for the EC and pH, when compared with OK. The research presentes an integrated helpful and effective mapping tool, especially in areas where there is lack of intensive field data on soil properties.

TI  - Detection of Sentinel Lymph Nodes with Near-Infrared Imaging in Malignancies
T2  - MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Optical molecular imaging, a highly sensitive and noninvasive technique which is simple to operate, inexpensive, and has the real-time capability, is increasingly being used in the diagnosis and treatment of carcinomas. The near-infrared fluorescence dye indocyanine green (ICG) is widely used in optical imaging for the dynamic detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in real time improving the detection rate and accuracy. ICG has the advantages of low scattering in tissue absorbance, low auto-fluorescence, and high signal-to-background ratio. The detection rate of axillary sentinel lymph nodes biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancers with ICG was more than 95%, the false-negative rate was lower than 10%, and the average detected number ranged from 1.75 to 3.8. The combined use of ICG with nuclein or blue dye resulted in a lower false-negative rate. ICG is also being used for the sentinel node detection in other malignant cancers such as head and neck, gastrointestinal, and gynecological carcinomas. In this article, we provide an overview of numerous studies that used the near-infrared fluorescence imaging to detect the sentinel lymph nodes in breast carcinoma and other malignant cancers. It is expected that with improvements in the optical imaging systems together with the use of a combination of multiple dyes and verification in large clinical trials, optical molecular imaging will become an essential tool for SLN detection and image-guided precise resection.

TI  - Assessment of the patterns of urban land covers and impervious surface areas: A case study of Shenzhen, China
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques have gradually become a popular tool for monitoring urban ecological environments because of their multi-temporal characteristics and rapid acquisition abilities. Based on five Landsat 8 scenes from 2013 to 2017, this study investigates the application of land cover classification and spectral mixture analysis in monitoring the urban environment of Shenzhen. By combining high-resolution data with field survey data, this study also assesses and analyzes the spatiotemporal patterns of various land cover types, including impervious surfaces. The results show that Landsat 8 data can effectively monitor the land covers of Shenzhen with a classification accuracy exceeding 90%. The results also demonstrate that Landsat 8 data can extract information regarding the abundance of impervious surfaces with an acceptable accuracy. Further investigation reveals that the expansion of urbanization in Shenzhen tends to be stable; nevertheless, the areas of impervious surfaces increase slightly, while the areas of forests and cropland decrease slightly. These changes may impact the urban ecological conditions of Shenzhen.

TI  - Land Use Change in Coastal Cities during the Rapid Urbanization Period from 1990 to 2016: A Case Study in Ningbo City, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal cities have been experiencing tremendous land use changes worldwide. Studies on the consequences of land use change in coastal cities have provided helpful information for spatial regulations and have attracted increased attention. Changes in forests and water bodies, however, have rarely been investigated, challenging the formation of a holistic pattern of land use change. In this study, we selected Ningbo, China, as a case study area and analyzed its land use change from 1990 to 2016. Random forest (RF) classification was employed to derive land use information from Landsat images. Transition matrices and a distribution index (DI) were applied to identify the major types of land use transitions and their spatial variations by site-specific attributes. The results showed that the entire time period could be divided into two stages, based on the manifestations of land use change in Ningbo: 1990-2005 and 2005-2016. During 1990-2005, construction land expanded rapidly, mainly through the occupation of agricultural land and forest, while during 2005-2016, the main change trajectory turned out to be a small net change in construction land and a net increase in agricultural land sourced from construction land, forests, and water bodies. In terms of land use change by site-specific attributes, the rapid expansion of construction land around the municipal city center during 1990-2005 was restrained, and similar amounts of land conversion between construction and agricultural use occurred during 2005-2016. During the study period, areas undergoing land use change also showed trends of moving outward from the municipal city center and the county centers located adjacent to roads and the coastline and of moving up to hilly areas with steeper slopes and higher elevations. Protecting reclaimed agricultural land, improving the efficiency of construction land, and controlling forest conversion in hilly areas are suggested as spatial regulations in Ningbo city.

TI  - Time Series High-Resolution Land Surface Albedo Estimation Based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous, long-term sequence, land surface albedo data have crucial significance for climate simulations and land surface process research. Sensors such as the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) provide global albedo product data sets with a spatial resolution of 500 m over long time periods. There is demand for new high-resolution albedo data for regional applications. High-resolution observations are often unavailable due to cloud contamination, which makes it difficult to obtain time series albedo estimations. This paper proposes an amalgamation albedo approach to generate daily land surface shortwave albedo with 30 m spatial resolution using Landsat data and the MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDF)/Albedo product MCD43A3 (V006). Historical MODIS land surface albedo products were averaged to obtain an albedo estimation background, which was used to construct the albedo dynamic model. The Thematic Mapper (TM) albedo derived via direct estimation approach was then introduced to generate high spatial-temporal resolution albedo data based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter algorithm (EnKF). Estimation results were compared to field observations for cropland, deciduous broadleaf forest, evergreen needleleaf forest, grassland, and evergreen broadleaf forest domains. The results indicated that for all land cover types, the estimated albedos coincided with ground measurements at a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.0085-0.0152. The proposed algorithm was then applied to regional time series albedo estimation; the results indicated that it captured spatial and temporal variation patterns for each site. Taken together, our results suggest that the amalgamation albedo approach is a feasible solution to generate albedo data sets with high spatio-temporal resolution.

TI  - Unsupervised Difference Representation Learning for Detecting Multiple Types of Changes in Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid increase of remote sensing images in temporal, spectral, and spatial resolutions, it is urgent to develop effective techniques for joint interpretation of spatial-temporal images. Multitype change detection (CD) is a significant research topic in multitemporal remote sensing image analysis, and its core is to effectively measure the difference degree and represent the difference among the multitemporal images. In this paper, we propose a novel difference representation learning (DRL) network and present an unsupervised learning framework for multitype CD task. Deep neural networks work well in representation learning but rely too much on labeled data, while clustering is a widely used classification technique free from supervision. However, the distribution of real remote sensing data is often not very friendly for clustering. To better highlight the changes and distinguish different types of changes, we combine difference measurement, DRL, and unsupervised clustering into a unified model, which can be driven to learn Gaussian-distributed and discriminative difference representations for nonchange and different types of changes. Furthermore, the proposed model is extended into an iterative framework to imitate the bottom-up aggregative clustering procedure, in which similar change types are gradually merged into the same classes. At the same time, the training samples are updated and reused to ensure that it converges to a stable solution. The experimental studies on four pairs of multispectral data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model on multitype CD.

TI  - Integrated Satellite, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Ground Inversion of the SPAD of Winter Wheat in the Reviving Stage
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll is the most important component of crop photosynthesis, and the reviving stage is an important period during the rapid growth of winter wheat. Therefore, rapid and precise monitoring of chlorophyll content in winter wheat during the reviving stage is of great significance. The satellite-UAV-ground integrated inversion method is an innovative solution. In this study, the core region of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) is used as a study area. Ground measurements data, UAV multispectral and Sentinel-2A multispectral imagery are used as data sources. First, representative plots in the Hekou District were selected as the core test area, and 140 ground sampling points were selected. Based on the measured SPAD values and UAV multispectral images, UAV-based SPAD inversion models were constructed, and the most accurate model was selected. Second, by comparing satellite and UAV imagery, a reflectance correction for satellite imagery was performed. Finally, based on the UAV-based inversion model and satellite imagery after reflectance correction, the inversion results for SPAD values in multi-scale were obtained. The results showed that green, red, red-edge and near-infrared bands were significantly correlated with SPAD values. The modeling precisions of the best inversion model are R-2 = 0.926, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 0.63 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 0.92, and the verification precisions are R-2 = 0.934, RMSE = 0.78 and MAE = 0.87. The Sentinel-2A imagery after the reflectance correction has a pronounced inversion effect; the SPAD values in the study area were concentrated between 40 and 60, showing an increasing trend from the eastern coast to the southwest and west, with obvious spatial differences. This study synthesizes the advantages of satellite, UAV and ground methods, and the proposed satellite-UAV-ground integrated inversion method has important implications for real-time, rapid and precision SPAD values collected on multiple scales.

TI  - Retrieval of Sea Surface Wind Speeds from Gaofen-3 Full Polarimetric Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the sea surface wind speed (SSWS) retrieval from Gaofen-3 (GF-3) quad-polarization stripmap (QPS) data in vertical-vertical (VV), horizontal-horizontal (HH), and vertical-horizontal (VH) polarizations is investigated in detail based on 3170 scenes acquired from October 2016 to May 2018. The radiometric calibration factor of the VV polarization data is examined first. This calibration factor generally meets the requirement of SSWS retrieval accuracy with an absolute bias of less than 0.5 m/s but shows highly dispersed characteristics. These results lead to SSWS retrievals with a small bias of 0.18 m/s, but a rather high root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.36 m/s when compared with the ERA-Interim reanalysis model data. Two refitted polarization ratio (PR) models for the QPS HH polarization data are presented. Based on a combination of the incidence angle-dependent and azimuth angle-dependent PR model and CMOD5.N, the SSWS derived from the QPS HH data shows a bias of 0.07 m/s and an RMSE of 2.26 m/s relative to the ERA-Interim reanalysis model wind speed. A linear function relating SSWS and the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) of QPS VH data is derived. The SSWS data retrieved from the QPS VH data show good agreement with the WindSat SSWS data, with a bias of 0.1 m/s and an RMSE of 2.02 m/s. We also apply the linear function to the GF-3 Wide ScanSAR data acquired for the typhoon SOULIK, which yields very good agreement with the model results. A comparison of SSWS retrievals among three different polarization datasets is also presented. The current study and our previous work demonstrate that the general accuracy of the SSWS retrieval based on GF-3 QPS data has an absolute bias of less than 0.3 m/s and an RMSE of 2.0 +/- 0.2 m/s relative to various datasets. Further improvement will depend on dedicated radiometric calibration efforts.

TI  - Spatial downscaling of thermal infrared image based on improved three-layer decomposition model
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature is one of the important parameters of geogas interaction and energy exhange. In order to obtain the land surface temperature data with high spatial resolution, this research improved a method of downscaling thermal infrared remote image, and was verified using Shanghai Landsat 8OLI/TIRS image as the data source. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was decomposed into low frequency layer, edge layer and detail layer, in which edge layer and detail layer are scaled up to the thermal infrared data. The proposed algorithm used simulated LST(270 m) as a downscaling data source to achieve downscaling LST (90 m), and compared with the classical thermal infrared downscaling method DisTrad algorithm and TsHARP algorithm. The results show that all three downscaling methods preserve the spatial characteristics of the original land surface temperature, but the DisTrad algorithm and the TsHARP algorithm add the detailed information that does not exist in original land surface temperature data. The improved three-layers decomposition model has a root mean square error of 0. 913 K, which is 0. 937 K and 0. 832 K higher than the DisTrad method and the TsHARP method.

TI  - Impacts of land cover and land use change on long-term trend of land surface phenology: a case study in agricultural ecosystems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenological trends during last few decades have been frequently reported and these trends are commonly assumed to result from climate change. With the widespread influence of both human activities and natural processes, however, land cover and land use change (LCLUC) has dominated across various ecosystems in more than one-third of world's land surface. LCLUC could lead to changes in vegetation types and species composition at local to regional scales. Thus, we hypothesize that LCLUC can significantly influence phenological trends at an ecosystem scale. Here we tested this hypothesis in agricultural ecosystems composed of various crop types spanning the Midwest of the United States by analyzing satellite-observed land surface phenology from 1982 to 2014. Greenup onset dates in croplands occurred later at rates ranging from 0.18 to 0.67 d yr(-1) at the state scale. This trend was due to significant areal increases in corn (maize) and soybean that have later emergence coupled with areal decreases in wheat and oats that have earlier emergence, despite a trend of warmer spring temperatures that aid earlier crop emergence. Overall, considering the long-term directional change in greenup onset dates across these croplands, two-thirds was attributable to LCLUC and one-third to climatic variation. This finding indicates that extensive LCLUC can be the primary driver of satellite-observed phenological trends, especially in intensively managed agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Identification and mapping of winter wheat by integrating temporal change information and Kullback-Leibler divergence
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop acreage and its spatial distribution are a base for agriculture related works. Current research combining medium and low spatial resolution images focuses on data fusion and unmixing methods. The purpose of the former is to generate synthetic fine spatial resolution data instead of directly solving the problem. In the latter, high-resolution data is only used to provide endmembers and the result is usually an abundance map rather than the true spatial distribution data. To solve this problem, this paper designs a conceptual model which divides the study area into different types of pixels at a MODIS 250 m scale. Only three types of pixels contain winter wheat, i.e., pure winter wheat pixels (P-A), the mixed pixels comprising winter wheat and other vegetation (M-A) and the mixed pixels comprising winter wheat and other crops (M-B). Different strategies are used in processing them. (1) Within the pure cultivated land pixels, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is employed to analyze the similarity between unknown pixels and the pure winter wheat samples on the temporal change characteristics of NDVI. Further P-A is identified. (2) For M-A, a proposed reverse unmixing method is firstly used to extract the temporal change information of cultivated land components, after which winter wheat is identified from the cultivated land components as previously described. (3) For M-B which only appears on the border of P-A, a mask is created by expanding the P-A and temporal difference is utilized to identify winter wheat under the mask. Finally, these three results are integrated at a TM scale with the aid of 25 to resolution land use data. We applied the proposed solution and obtained a good result in the main agricultural area of the Yiluo River Basin. The identified winter wheat planting acreage is 161,050.00 hm(2). The result is validated based on the five-hundred random validation points. Overall accuracy is 94.80% and Kappa coefficient is 0.85. This demonstrates that the temporal information reflecting crop growth is also an important indicator, and the KL divergence makes it more convenient in identifying winter wheat. This research provided a new perspective for the combination of low and medium spatial resolution remote sensing images. The proposed solution can also be effectively applied in other places and countries for the crop which has a clear temporal change characteristic that is different from others.

TI  - Multiscale Applications of Two Online-Coupled Meteorology-Chemistry Models during Recent Field Campaigns in Australia, Part I: Model Description and WRF/Chem-ROMS Evaluation Using Surface and Satellite Data and Sensitivity to Spatial Grid Resolutions
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution and associated human exposure are important research areas in Greater Sydney, Australia. Several field campaigns were conducted to characterize the pollution sources and their impacts on ambient air quality including the Sydney Particle Study Stages 1 and 2 (SPS1 and SPS2), and the Measurements of Urban, Marine, and Biogenic Air (MUMBA). In this work, the Weather Research and Forecasting model with chemistry (WRF/Chem) and the coupled WRF/Chem with the Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS) (WRF/Chem-ROMS) are applied during these field campaigns to assess the models' capability in reproducing atmospheric observations. The model simulations are performed over quadruple-nested domains at grid resolutions of 81-, 27-, 9-, and 3-km over Australia, an area in southeastern Australia, an area in New South Wales, and the Greater Sydney area, respectively. A comprehensive model evaluation is conducted using surface observations from these field campaigns, satellite retrievals, and other data. This paper evaluates the performance of WRF/Chem-ROMS and its sensitivity to spatial grid resolutions. The model generally performs well at 3-, 9-, and 27-km resolutions for sea-surface temperature and boundary layer meteorology in terms of performance statistics, seasonality, and daily variation. Moderate biases occur for temperature at 2-m and wind speed at 10-m in the mornings and evenings due to the inaccurate representation of the nocturnal boundary layer and surface heat fluxes. Larger underpredictions occur for total precipitation due to the limitations of the cloud microphysics scheme or cumulus parameterization. The model performs well at 3-, 9-, and 27-km resolutions for surface O-3 in terms of statistics, spatial distributions, and diurnal and daily variations. The model underpredicts PM2.5 and PM10 during SPS1 and MUMBA but overpredicts PM2.5 and underpredicts PM10 during SPS2. These biases are attributed to inaccurate meteorology, precursor emissions, insufficient SO2 conversion to sulfate, inadequate dispersion at finer grid resolutions, and underprediction in secondary organic aerosol. The model gives moderate biases for net shortwave radiation and cloud condensation nuclei but large biases for other radiative and cloud variables. The performance of aerosol optical depth and latent/sensible heat flux varies for different simulation periods. Among all variables evaluated, wind speed at 10-m, precipitation, surface concentrations of CO, NO, NO2, SO2, O-3, PM2.5, and PM10, aerosol optical depth, cloud optical thickness, cloud condensation nuclei, and column NO2 show moderate-to-strong sensitivity to spatial grid resolutions. The use of finer grid resolutions (3- or 9-km) can generally improve the performance for those variables. While the performance for most of these variables is consistent with that over the U.S. and East Asia, several differences along with future work are identified to pinpoint reasons for such differences.

TI  - Mapping annual forest cover by fusing PALSAR/PALSAR-2 and MODIS NDVI during 2007-2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) HH and HV polarization data were used previously to produce annual, global 25 m forest maps between 2007 and 2010, and the latest global forest maps of 2015 and 2016 were produced by using the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data. However, annual 25 m spatial resolution forest maps during 2011-2014 are missing because of the gap in operation between ALOS and ALOS-2, preventing the construction of a continuous, fine resolution time-series dataset on the world's forests. In contrast, the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI images were available globally since 2000. This research developed a novel method to produce annual 25 m forest maps during 2007-2016 by fusing the fine spatial resolution, but asynchronous PALSAR/PALSAR-2 with coarse spatial resolution, but synchronous MODIS NDVI data, thus, filling the four-year gap in the ALOS and ALOS-2 time-series, as well as enhancing the existing mapping activity. The method was developed concentrating on two key objectives: 1) producing more accurate 25 m forest maps by integrating PALSAR/PALSAR-2 and MODIS NDVI data during 2007-2010 and 2015-2016; 2) reconstructing annual 25 m forest maps from time-series MODIS NDVI images during 2011-2014. Specifically, a decision tree classification was developed for forest mapping based on both the PALSAR/PALSAR-2 and MODIS NDVI data, and a new spatial-temporal super resolution mapping was proposed to reconstruct the 25 m forest maps from time-series MODIS NDVI images. Three study sites including Paraguay, the USA and Russia were chosen, as they represent the world's three main forest types: tropical forest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, and boreal conifer forest, respectively. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed approach produced the most accurate continuous time-series of fine spatial resolution forest maps both visually and quantitatively. For the forest maps during 2007-2010 and 2015-2016, the results had greater overall accuracy values (> 98%) than those of the original JAXA forest product. For the reconstructed 25 m forest maps during 2011-2014, the increases in classifications accuracy relative to three benchmark methods were statistically significant, and the overall accuracy values of the three study sites were almost universally > 92%. The proposed approach, therefore, has great potential to support the production of annual 25 m forest maps by fusing PALSAR/PALSAR-2 and MODIS NDVI during 2007-2016.

TI  - Evaluation of MAIAC aerosol retrievals over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) is a new aerosol algorithm developed to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) over land using the time series data to dynamically isolate aerosol and land contributions. However, there are still no comprehensive research on the quality of MAIAC AOD over China. In this paper, 1 km MAIAC AOD over China were examined against ground-based measurements to evaluate the performance of the data. In general, Aqua and Terra MAIAC retrievals have a high correlation coefficient (0.924 for Aqua and 0.933 for Terra) with ground-based observations and there are more than 72% of retrievals falling within the Expected Errors (EE = +/- (0.05 + 0.2*AOD)). We found that the accuracy of MAIAC AOD is related with the AOD magnitude, aerosol size, seasons and surface types. In spring and summer, the AOD bias was influenced by both aerosol model and surface reflectance estimation. We also found that the aerosol model is the main source of AOD bias over desert regions. These results indicated that the MAIAC AOD could be used as a new aerosol data source for air quality and climate studies in China.

TI  - A Bayesian Kriging Regression Method to Estimate Air Temperature Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface air temperature (Ta) is an important physical quantity, usually measured at ground weather station networks. Measured Ta data is inadequate to characterize the complex spatial patterns of Ta field due to low density and unevenness of the networks. Remote sensing can provide satellite imagery with large scale spatial coverage and fine resolution. Estimating spatially continuous Ta by integrating ground measurements and satellite data is an active research area. A variety of methods have been proposed and applied in this area. However, the existing studies primarily focused on daily Ta and failed to quantify uncertainties in model parameter and estimated results. In this paper, a Bayesian Kriging regression (BKR) method is proposed to model and estimate monthly Ta using satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) as the only input. The BKR is a spatial statistical model with the capacity to quantify uncertainties via Bayesian inference. The BKR method was applied to estimate monthly maximum air temperature (Tmax) and minimum air temperature (Tmin) over the conterminous United States in 2015. An exploratory analysis shows a strong relationship between LST and Ta at the monthly scale, indicating LST has the great potential to estimate monthly Ta. 10-fold cross-validation approach was adopted to compare the predictive performance of the BKR method with the linear regression method over the whole region and the urban areas of the contiguous United States. For the whole region, the results show that the BKR method achieves a competitively better performance with averaged RMSE values 1.23 K for Tmax and 1.20 K for Tmin, which are also lower than previous studies on estimation of monthly Ta. In the urban areas, the cross-validation demonstrates similar results with averaged RMSE values 1.21 K for Tmax and 1.27 K for Tmin. Posterior samples for model parameters and estimated Ta were obtained and used to analyze uncertainties in the model parameters and estimated Ta. The BKR method provides a promising way to estimate Ta with competitively predictive performance and to quantify model uncertainties at the same time.

TI  - Fifteen-year statistical analysis of cloud characteristics over China using Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using 15-year observations obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board both NASA Terra and Aqua from March 2003 to February 2018, this study investigated the spatio-temporal variations of both macro- and micro-physical cloud properties over China, including cloud fraction (CF), cloud top pressure (CTP), cloud top temperature (CTT), cloud optical thickness (COT), and effective radius (r(e)) of both liquid water and ice clouds. Multi-year averaged CF is around 61% over whole China region. However, CF varies with both regions and seasons. The CFs are about 6-8% larger in summer and winter (64-65%) than in spring and autumn (58%). By classifying China into five regimes, which are northwestern China (NW), northeastern China (NE), Tibetan Plateau (TP), northern China (N), and southern China (S), there is a clear CF regional distribution pattern. In general, there are large amount of clouds in S and southeast of TP, and small amount in NE, N, NW and most TP. Moreover, there are generally more clouds over ocean than over land, and much more clouds over S than over N. The CFs are larger (smaller) in the afternoon than in the morning over most land (ocean) regions. Furthermore, the largest CF differences between afternoon and morning occur over the TP region in China. COT demonstrates almost the same regional distribution pattern as the CF for all four seasons. Specifically, COT is higher in S than in N, which is most likely associated with the type of clouds and the availability of water vapour. Cloud r(e) shows larger values in NW and TP than in eastern China regions in all seasons except for summer, which could be related to the heavy aerosol pollution in eastern China regions. Accompanying with the cold cloud tops over TP, a low CTP centre is often located there.

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of vegetation in Xishuangbanna from 2001 to 2015 based on MOD13Q1 data
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Xishuangbanna, the largest rainforest region in China, is one of the most important biodiversity conservation areas in the world. Studying the temporal and spatial variations of vegetation in Xishuangbanna and its relationship with climate factors can provide scientific supports for environmental management. This study, based on MODIS-NDVI dataset, aims to assess the spatial-temporal dynamics and spatial autocorrelation distribution pattern of NDVI and its response to thermal-moisture factors in Xishuangbanna from 2001 to 2015. Spatial autocorrelation analysis, linear-regression analysis and partial correlation analysis were carried out. From 2001 to 2015, annual NDVI showed a slowly upward trend, with a rate of 0.11% . 10 a(-1) and the most pronounced enhancement in 2011-2015. NDVI had a "season inversion" phenomenon, i.e., the lowest NDVI value occurred in summer. In the past 15 years, mean NDVI of Xishuangbanna was 0.875, with a pattern of "high in the east and low in the west". The NDVI threshold within 0.85-0.9 accounted for the largest proportion of the area. From 2001 to 2015, the Global Moran's I of NDVI was greater than 0.65, showing a significant positive spatial autocorrelation, but the degree of spatial agglomeration of NDVI had weakened and tended to be fragmented. In 2013, the spatial heterogeneity of NDVI was the strongest. There were differences in vegetation change across different climate types. In the north tropical zone, the areas with improvement and degradation accounted for 28.74% and 9.40%, respectively. In the south subtropical and mid-subtropical zones, the deteriorated area was slightly higher than the improved area. Temperature was the dominant factor driving vegetation growth in Xishuangbanna, which was positively correlated with NDVI from December to February of the following year. Precipitation from June to November was significantly negatively correlated with NDVI.

TI  - A coupled convolutional neural network for small and densely clustered ship detection in SAR images
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery plays a significant role in global marine surveillance. However, a desirable performance is rarely achieved when detecting small and densely clustered ship targets, and this problem is difficult to solve. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown strong detection power in computer vision and are flexible in complex background conditions, whereas traditional methods have limited ability. However, CNNs struggle to detect small targets and densely clustered ones that exist widely in many SAR images. To address this problem while preserving the good properties for complex background conditions, we develop a coupled CNN for small and densely clustered SAR ship detection. The proposed method mainly consists of two subnetworks: an exhaustive ship proposal network (ESPN) for ship-like region generation from multiple layers with multiple receptive fields, and an accurate ship discrimination network (ASDN) for false alarm elimination by referring to the context information of each proposal generated by ESPN. The motivation in ESPN is to generate as many ship proposals as possible, and in ASDN, the goal is to obtain the final results accurately. Experiments are evaluated on two data sets. One is collected from 60 wide-swath Sentinel-1 images and the other is from 20 GaoFen-3 (GF-3) images. Both data sets contain many ships that are small and densely clustered. The quantitative comparison results illustrate the clear improvements of the new method in terms of average precision (AP) and F1 score by 0.4028 and 0.3045 for the Sentinel-1 data set compared with the multi-step constant false alarm rate (CFAR-MS) method. The values are verified as 0.2033 and 0.1522 for the GF-3 data set. In addition, the new method is demonstrated to be more efficient than CFAR-MS.

TI  - Kriging methods with auxiliary nighttime lights data to detect potentially toxic metals concentrations in soil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of potentially toxic metals (PTMs) has been shown to be related to anthropogenic activities. Several auxiliary variables, such as those related to remote sensing data (e.g. digital elevation models, land use, and enhanced vegetation index) and soil properties (e.g. pH, soil type and cation exchange capacity), have been used to predict the spatial distribution of soil PTMs. However, these variables are mostly focused on natural processes or a single aspect of anthropogenic activities and cannot reflect the effects of integrated anthropogenic activities. Nighttime lights (NTL) images, a representative variable of integrated anthropogenic activities, may have the potential to reflect PTMs distribution. To uncover this relationship and determine the effects on evaluation precision, the NTL was employed as an auxiliary variable to map the distribution of PTMs in the United Kingdom. In this study, areas with a digital number (DN) >= 50 and an area > 30 km(2) were extracted from NTL images to represent regions of high-frequency anthropogenic activities. Subsequently, the distance between the sampling points and the nearest extracted area was calculated. Barium, lead, zinc, copper, and nickel concentrations exhibited the highest correlation with this distance. Their concentrations were mapped using distance as an auxiliary variable through three different kriging methods, i.e., ordinary kriging (OK), cokriging (CK), and regression kriging (RK). The accuracy of the predictions was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross validation method. Regardless of the elements, CK and RK always exhibited lower mean absolute error and root mean square error, in contrast to OK. This indicates that using the NTL as the auxiliary variable indeed enhanced the prediction accuracy for the relevant PTMs. Additionally, RK showed superior results in most cases. Hence, we recommend RK for prediction of PTMs when using the NTL as the auxiliary variable. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Characteristics of Surface Albedo Change Trends over the Antarctic Sea Ice Region during Recent Decades
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on a long-time series (1982-2015) of remote sensing data, we analyzed the change in surface albedo (SAL) during summer (from December to the following February) for the entire Antarctic Sea Ice Region (ASIR) and five longitudinal sectors around Antarctica: (1). the Weddell Sea (WS), (2). Indian Ocean, (3). Pacific Ocean (PO), (4). Ross Sea, and (5). Bellingshausen-Amundsen Sea (BS). Empirical mode decomposition was used to extract the trend of the original signal, and then a slope test method was utilized to identify a transition point. The SAL provided by the CM SAF cloud, Albedo, and Surface Radiation dataset from AVHRR data-Second Edition was validated at Neumayer station. Sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) were also analyzed. The trend of the SAL/SIC was positive during summer over the ASIR and five longitudinal sectors, except for the BS (-2.926% and -4.596% per decade for SAL and SIC, correspondingly). Moreover, the largest increasing trend of SAL and SIC appeared in the PO at approximately 3.781% and 3.358% per decade, respectively. However, the decreasing trend of SAL/SIC in the BS slowed down, and the increasing trend of SAL/SIC in the PO accelerated. The trend curves of the SST exhibited a crest around 2000-2005; thus, the slope lines of the SST showed an increasing-decreasing type for the ASIR and the five longitudinal sectors. The evolution of summer albedo decreased rapidly in the early summer and then maintained a relatively stable level for the whole ASIR. The change of it mainly depended on the early melt of sea ice during the entire summer. The change of sea ice albedo had a narrow range when compared with composite albedo and SIC over the five longitudinal sectors and reached a stable level earlier. The transition point of SAL/SIC in several sectors appeared around the year 2000, whereas that of the SST for the entire ASIR occurred in 2003-2005. A high value of SAL/SIC and a low value of the SST existed in the WS which can be displayed by the spatial distribution of pixel average. In addition, the lower the latitude was, the lower the SAL/SIC and the higher the SST would be. A transition point of SAL appeared in 2001 in most areas of West Antarctica. This transition point could be illustrated by anomaly maps. The spatial distribution of the pixel-based trend of SAL demonstrated that the change in SAL in East Antarctica has exhibited a positive trend in recent decades. However, in West Antarctica, the change of SAL presented a decreasing trend before 2001 and transformed into an increasing trend afterward, especially in the east of the Antarctic Peninsula.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variability in water transparency in Yunnan Plateau lakes, China
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water transparency (represented by Secchi disk depth, SDD), a key physical feature of lake ecosystems, is directly controlled by optically active substances, including organic matter (concentration and composition) and phytoplankton biomass which are closely related to eutrophication and climate warming. Here, we examined the trends in SDD variation and the driving mechanisms based on short-term (35 lakes, JulySeptember 2017) and long-term (3 lakes, 19822016) datasets covering lakes with different trophic states on the Yunnan Plateau. In the short-term dataset, increases in organic matter content, phytoplankton biomass and trophic state reduced the SDD. In the long-term dataset, the annual SDD decreased significantly in all three lakes. Significant increases occurred in phytoplankton biomass in eutrophic Lake Dianchi, both phytoplankton biomass and organic matter content in oligo-mesotrophic Lake Erhai, and organic matter content in oligotrophic Lake Fuxianhu over time, and these increases were related to increased trophic state (or change in nutrient level) and/or possibly to climate warming. Furthermore, phytoplankton biomass and organic matter content were important direct driving factors for reduced SDD in eutrophic Lake Dianchi and oligotrophic Lake Fuxianhu, respectively, while the interaction of these two factors was the most important factor in oligo-mesotrophic Lake Erhai. These results implied that eutrophication and climate warming could regulate SDD by changing organic matter concentration and/or phytoplankton biomass, which may depend on the lacustrine trophic state. However, further studies across larger geographical scales and more lakes are needed to confirm these results.

TI  - A Study of Soil Salinity Inversion Based on Multispectral Remote Sensing Index in Ebinur Lake Wetland Nature Reserve
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is an important factor for measuring soil quality, and it is also a basic condition for the growth of crops. Therefore, it is urgent to find a method that can understand soil salt content quickly. This paper is based on the Landsat8 OLI multispectral remote sensing image for the Ebinur Lake Wetland Nature Reserve, and we use the salt content of 36 soil surface samples in the study area as the data source, and choose several multispectral remote sensing indices which have the superior correlation with soil salinity to analyze the soil salinity distribution in the study area. The linear, logarithmic and quadratic function models were constructed with the measured soil salinity, and optimum inversion model of soil salt content was selected. The result shows that; (1)Among these multispectral remote sensing indices, the enhanced vegetation indices show the closest correlation with soil salinity, and the correlation coefficient range is between -0.67 and -0.70. The second is the traditional vegetation indices, and the correlation coefficient range is between -0.46 and -0.58. The correlation of soil salt index is the farthest t, and its range is between 0.16 and -0.45, and there is no correlation between SI3, SI4 and soil salt content. (2)Comparing and analyzing the salt distribution map inverted by measured soil salinity values and the spatial distribution of Enhanced Vegetation indices, we found that the soil salt content around the Ebinur Lake of the northwest and south direction and tne Yan Chi Bridge in the northeast is higher, but the enhanced vegetation indices are lower. The result shows that the salt distribution map inverted by measured soil salinity values is consistent with the spatial distribution of Enhanced Vegetation indices. It indicates that the enhanced vegetation indices have a higher sensitivity to soil salinity, which can better reverse the spatial distribution of soil salinity in the study area. (3)From the comparison and analysis of those models, which builds the three enhanced vegetation indices and measured soil salt content respectively. We found that the enhanced ratio vegetation index is the best choice to construct the quadratic function model. The determination coefficient of its validation set (R-2) is 0.92, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 2.48, and the relative analysis error (RPD) is 2.09. The data show that this model is more accurate and reliable. In summary, ERVI is more sensitive to soil salinity and predict the soil salinity content, while is more suitable for inversion of soil salinity in this study area. Therefore, the study indicates that it is feasible to invert the soil salinity by the enhanced vegetation index constructed by the b6 and b7 band of Landsat8 multipectral remote sensing imagery. And its inversion effect is better than that of traditional visible light band. Therefore, this study not only provides a theoretical reference for remote sensing inversion, but also has important implications for the quantitative estimation and dynamic monitoring of soil salinity for the study area. Otherwise, it can be used as an alternative offer for prediction of soil salt content in other regions.

TI  - Cetaceans and microplastics: First report of microplastic ingestion by a coastal delphinid, <i>Sousa chinensis</i>
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Anthropocene, marine microplastic debris has been rapidly increasing and interacting with wildlife. As apex predators, cetaceans have been proven to be ideal sentinel species to indicate ecosystem changes and umbrella and flagship species to help develop environmental management strategies. Here, we report the presence of microplastics in the intestines of Sousa chinensis for the first time, which highlights the potential impacts of microplastic pollution in coastal environments. Microplastics were detected in the intestinal contents of both adult and calf individuals, indicating that consumption of prey and unintentional ingestion are the potential pathways for microplastic accumulation in Sousa chinensis. The properties of the microplastics indicated that fibers, white and blue items, 1-5 mm items, and polyester were the predominant shapes, colors, sizes and plastic materials, respectively. More microplastics were detected in the foreguts and midguts than in the hindguts, which may be correlated with the specific intestinal structure of Sousa. This study indicates that coastal delphinids might suffer from microplastic pollution, even young calves. The sample size in this study is limited, whereas it's a starting point for assessing microplastics in the endangered coastal delphinid, Sousa. We suggest that assessments of the risks of microplastic consumption by cetaceans and the presence of microplastics in their habitats should be conducted at a global scale. Moreover, further works should be done to look for evidence of adverse effects of microplastics pollution on cetaceans. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Benefits of the free and open Landsat data policy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The United States (U.S.) federal government provides imagery obtained by federally funded Earth Observation satellites typically at no cost. For many years Landsat was an exception to this trend, until 2008 when the United States Geological Survey (USGS) made Landsat data accessible via the internet for free. Substantial increases in downloads of Landsat imagery ensued and led to a rapid expansion of science and operational applications, serving government, private sector, and civil society. The Landsat program hence provides an example to space agencies worldwide on the value of open access for Earth Observation data and has spurred the adaption of similar policies globally, including the European Copernicus Program. Here, we describe important aspects of the Landsat free and open data policy and highlight the importance and continued relevance of this policy.

TI  - A surface network based method for studying urban hierarchies by night time light remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban hierarchies are closely related to economic growth, urban planning and sustainable urban development. Due to the limited availability of reliable statistical data at fine scales, most existing studies on urban hierarchy characterization failed to capture the detailed urban spatial structure information. Previous studies have demonstrated that night time light data are correlated with many urban socio-economic indicators and hence can be used to characterize urban hierarchies. This paper presents a novel method for studying urban hierarchies from night time light data. Night time light data were first conceptualized as continuous mathematical surfaces, termed night time light surfaces. From the morphology of these surfaces the corresponding surface networks were derived. Hereafter, a night time light intensity (NTLI) graph was defined to describe the morphology of the surface network. Then, structural similarity between the night time light surfaces of any two different cities was calculated via a threshold-based maximum common induced graph searching algorithm. Finally, urban hierarchies were defined on the basis of the structural similarities between different cities. Using the 2015 annual NPP-VIIRS night time light data, the urban hierarchies of 32 major cities in China were successfully examined. The results are highly consistent with the reference urban hierarchies.

TI  - Deep feature learning versus shallow feature learning systems for joint use of airborne thermal hyperspectral and visible remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the development of various remote sensing sensors has provided more reliable information and data for identification of different ground classes. Accordingly, multisensory fusion techniques are applied to enhance the process of information extraction from complementary airborne and spaceborne remote sensing data. Most of previous research in the literature has focused on the extraction of shallow features from a specific sensor and on classification of the resulted feature space using decision fusion systems. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have drawn a lot of attention in the machine learning area and have had different remote sensing applications, especially on data fusion. This study presents two different feature-learning strategies for the fusion of hyperspectral thermal infrared (HTIR) and visible remote sensing data. First, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN)-Support Vector Machine (SVM) was utilized on the features of two datasets to provide the class labels. To validate the results with other learning strategies, a shallow feature model was used, as well. This model was based on feature fusion and decision fusion that classified and fused the two datasets. A co-registered thermal infrared hyperspectral (HTIR) and Fine Resolution Visible (Vis) RGB imagery was available from Quebec of Canada to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results showed that, except for the computational time, the proposed deep learning model outperformed shallow feature-based strategies in the classification performance that was based on its accuracy.

TI  - Quantifying coconut palm extent on Pacific islands using spectral and textural analysis of very high resolution imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Native forests on islands throughout the global tropics face increasing pressure from the human-driven expansion of coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) planted for the purposes of coconut oil harvest. Conversion from native forests to Cocos monocultures leads to drastic ecological consequences in island environments and alters terrestrial and marine food webs through a variety of cascading effects and feedbacks. Despite the ecological significance and geographic range of Cocos expansion, large-scale assessments of coconut proliferation are still lacking due to the isolated nature of many islands where Cocos is found. Remote sensing approaches are often used to monitor forest composition at broad scales, but the small physical size of most islands limits the use of many popular satellite sensors with 15-30 m resolution. The recent availability of very high resolution (<5 m) satellite imagery facilitates novel assessment of this major ecological pattern, but the increased resolution introduces problematic 'salt-and-pepper' effects due to the heterogeneous nature of palm frond canopies. This case study evaluates the effectiveness of applying grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textural features to very high resolution (0.5-2 m) WorldView-2 imagery to resolve the canopy heterogeneity problem and map the extent of Cocos spread on 21 islets of Palmyra Atoll, a protected United States National Wildlife Refuge in the Northern Line Islands. A random forest (RF)-driven classification scheme differentiating between coconut palms, native trees including Pisonia grandis, and endemic Scaevola sericea shrubs achieved 97.0% overall accuracy and 98.4% producer's and user's accuracies for the coconut palm class when trained on a combined spectral and GLCM textural feature set. Classifications restricted to the eight spectral bands of WorldView-2 are not only less accurate (89.4% overall accuracy), but also significantly worse at identifying Cocos canopies (79.0% versus 98.0% accuracy when GLCM textures are included). However, paring down the full set of sixteen spectral and textural features to the three most important of each type did not result in significant changes in accuracy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of a joint high-resolution textural and spectral approach for remotely quantifying the spread of Cocos and its impacts on native tree communities throughout the tropics, including remote island locations.

TI  - An analysis of spectral variability in hyperspectral imagery: a case study of stressed oil palm detection in Colombia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral images have acquired an increasing interest in the scientific and civil community to detect or classify materials by their spectral signature in remote sensing applications. However, spectral signatures can vary because of lighting or atmospheric conditions. This phenomenon is known as spectral variability, and ignoring this variability is an important source of error in the analysis of hyperspectral images. Therefore, this work focuses on analysing different causes and effects of the spectral variability in hyperspectral images, by studying the latest advances in this area, including approaches that do not address the phenomenon and methods that address spectral variability. Experiments are executed with five different approaches to compare their accuracy in the estimation of abundances in synthetic data generated with spectral variability. Specifically, a case study is developed on hyperspectral data of oil palm crops in Colombia, which exhibit high spectral variability. The results of identification of stressed oil palms are compared by mapping the abundances of three classes (diseased oil palm, healthy oil palm, and background), evaluating the performance of the different approaches in terms of the root mean squared error (RMSE), reconstruction error (RE), and spectral angle mapping (SAM). Results show that the coordinate descent algorithm-mismodelling effects (CDA-ME) present the best performance, outperforming in up to 70% the other approaches with and without spectral variability since it can jointly model changes of illumination, effects of variability and outlier values present in the hyperspectral images.

TI  - Integrative geoarchaeological research on settlement patterns in the dynamic landscape of the northwestern Nile delta
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Settlement activity in the Nile delta is characterized by its profound connection to the branches of the river Nile. Major ancient settlements were founded next to waterways. The constant shifting of these Nile branches - coming either too close or moving too far away - was a fundamental challenge for settlements. This research focuses on the region around Buto (Tell el-Fara'in) in the northwestern Nile delta. The massive increase in settlements in the Ptolemaic, Roman and in particular late Roman periods (4th c BC - 7th c AD) needs to be connected with a fundamental change in the landscape and the way people interacted with the landscape. A particular challenge to reconstructing the ancient land and waterscape was posed by the regional lack of an indicative modern surface relief. A linear settlement pattern of ancient sites was interpreted as showing the distribution along a defunct river branch. A combination of remote sensing data, in particular a new high re-solution DEM based on Tandem-X data, and a program of over thirty cores on the ground, have clarified the landscape, especially its fluvial pattern, and the placements of associated settlements. In the north of the study region, the DEM shows elevated levees of former palaeorivers belonging to a finely ramified subdelta, with all settlements placed on alluvial levees. The corings uncovered different artificial channels and identified ancient natural riverbeds at a deep level but similar depth, suggesting that the streams were active during the occupation of these sites and the ancient settlements were either in direct vicinity of the natural rivers or connected via artificial channels. These artificial channels found in corings next to the settlements show characteristics of slack water regimes. In essence, the massive increase of settlements spread over the northwestern delta in Classical Antiquity was spurred by multiple branches that provided routes of transportation, fresh water for irrigation and good conditions for agriculture on their elevated and fertile levees.

TI  - Possible causes for the asymmetric evolution between the aerosol optical depth over East Asia and eastern United States during boreal spring
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations have suggested that the 550-nm aerosol optical depth (AOD) decreases over East Asia (EA) but increases over eastern United States (EUS) in boreal spring. Based on the NCEP CFSR reanalysis and TRMM 3A25 data set, the present work indicates that this asymmetry can be ascribed to the distinct feedback of general circulation and atmospheric heat source (AHS) between the two regions. In April and May, condensation heating becomes dominant in the AHS over EA and leads to low-level southerly and upper-tropospheric northerly flow in response. Subsequently, deep convection with strong ascending motion is generated, which reduces AOD over EA via the effect of vertical ventilation and rainfall-related washout. Meanwhile, the AHS over EUS is induced by circulation originating from the Tropics and mid-high latitudes. Thus, AOD further increases over EUS due to the absence of vertical ventilation and the import of dust aerosols from EA in the upper troposphere during late spring. Also discussed is the role played by the Tibetan Plateau in this distinct AHS-circulation relationship between EA and EUS.

TI  - Mapping the spatial distribution and changes of oil palm land cover using an open source cloud-based mapping platform
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm has become well known for its oil palm yields that can be used to produce food, biodiesel and biogas. The rapid expansion of oil palm plantations over large areas has changed the land use and land cover of surroundings. Changes in land covers can be mapped and later used for further analysis. However, obtaining and classifying large coverages require massive amounts of data and computing resources and the skills and time of analysts. The Remote Ecosystem Monitoring Assessment Pipeline (REMAP) provides a cloud computing platform that hosts an open-source stacked Landsat data that allows land cover classification to be implemented using a built-in random forest supervised machine learning algorithm. Classifications were performed with the aid of predictor layers to discriminate the following land covers in Peninsular Malaysia: oil palm, built-up, bare soil, water, forest, other vegetation and paddy. The classification performed on period 1 (1999-2003) and period 2 (2014-2017) data produced an overall accuracy of 80.34% and 79.53% respectively. The analysis of the changes in oil palm distributions from period 1 to period 2 indicated an increment of 23.59%. Further analysis revealed that oil palm expansion in Peninsular Malaysia only minimally affected forested area and is mostly resulted from the conversion of less productive crops to oil palm. Results prove the land cover mapping and change detection capabilities of REMAP as a cloud computing platform for large areas. Despite its limitations, REMAP has the potential to achieve fast-paced mapping over large areas and monitor land changes in oil palm distributions.

TI  - Clinical factors associated with persistently poor diabetes control in the Veterans Health Administration: A nationwide cohort study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivePatients with persistent poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus (PPDM) despite engagement in clinic-based care are at particularly high risk for diabetes complications and costs. Understanding this population's demographics, comorbidities and care utilization could guide strategies to address PPDM. We characterized factors associated with PPDM in a large sample of Veterans with type 2 diabetes.MethodsWe identified a cohort of Veterans with medically treated type 2 diabetes, who received Veterans Health Administration primary care during fiscal years 2012 and 2013. PPDM was defined by hemoglobin A1c levels uniformly >8.5% during fiscal year (FY) 2012, despite engagement with care during this period. We used FY 2012 demographic, comorbidity and medication data to describe PPDM in relation to better-controlled diabetes patients and created multivariable models to examine associations between clinical factors and PPDM. We also constructed multivariable models to explore the association between PPDM and FY 2013 care utilization.ResultsIn our cohort of diabetes patients (n = 435,820), 12% met criteria for PPDM. Patients with PPDM were younger than better-controlled patients, less often married, and more often Black/African-American and Hispanic or Latino/Latina. Of included comorbidities, only retinopathy (OR 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63,1.73) and nephropathy (OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.19,1.34) demonstrated clinically significant associations with PPDM. Complex insulin regimens such as premixed (OR 10.80, 95% CI: 10.11,11.54) and prandial-containing regimens (OR 18.74, 95% CI: 17.73,19.81) were strongly associated with PPDM. Patients with PPDM had higher care utilization, particularly endocrinology care (RR 3.56, 95% CI: 3.47,3.66); although only 26.4% of patients saw endocrinology overall.ConclusionPPDM is strongly associated with complex diabetes regimens, although heterogeneity in care utilization exists. While there is evidence of underutilization, inadequacy of available care may also contribute to PPDM. Our findings should inform tailored approaches to meet the needs of PPDM, who are among the highest-risk, highest-cost patients with diabetes.

TI  - Impact of land use/cover changes on lake ecosystem of Ethiopia central rift valley
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Rift Valley (CRV) Ethiopia is an important region in terms of its vast ecosystem services (ES)and enriched biodiversity. However, its ES and biodiversity are under terrific pressure from hurried population growth, unsustainable developmental activities, unplanned urbanization, aggressive agricultural expansion, climate change, and the associated changes in land use and land cover (LULC). This study was aimed at analyze LULC changes in the Ethiopia CRV areas from 1985 to 2015 through Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques. Satellite images were accessed, pre-processed and classified. Field observations, discussion with dwellers (elders) were also employed to validate results from remotely sensed data. Major LULC types were detected and change analysis was executed. Consequently, nine LULC changes were successfully evaluated. The classification result revealed that in 1985 the area was covered by 44.34% with small-scale farming followed by mixed cultivated/acacia (21.89%), open woodland (11.96%), and water bodies (9.77%), respectively. Though the area measure varied among land use classes, the trend of share occupied by the LULC types in the study area remained the same in 1995 and 2015. In this research increase in small and large-scale farming, settlements and mixed cultivation/acacia while a decrease in water bodies, forest, and open woodlands is noted. Accordingly, the overall accuracy of this study was 84.46, 86.86 and 88.86 with kapa value of 0.82, 0.84 and 0.87, respectively. Lastly, the DPSIR framework analysis was done and integrated land use and policy reform are suggested as a response for sustainable land use planning and management.

TI  - Large-scale urban mapping using integrated geographic object-based image analysis and artificial bee colony optimization from worldview-3 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) has demonstrated strong capability compared with pixel-based algorithms for urban characterization studies. In this study, new solutions to feature selection (FS) and image segmentation optimization are investigated in the GEOBIA domain. First, the combination of Taguchi-based optimization technique and F-score segmentation quality measures was adopted to optimize the parameters of multiresolution segmentation (MRS) and determine the optimum multiscale combinations of MRS parameters. Second, artificial bee colony (ABC) FS was integrated to select the most relevant features. Third, random forest (RF) classification algorithm was utilized to extract multiscale urban land use/land cover (LULC) classes from geographically wide images obtained from two WorldView-3 image datasets. The proposed method was developed in the first study area and later applied to the second study area for validation. Results of image segmentation optimization indicated that scales 40 and 80 were the best for classification. The result of FS through ABC outperformed those of other FS techniques, including support vector machine with recursive feature elimination (SVM-REF), variable selection using RF, Boruta, genetic algorithm, correlation-based FS, and chi-square, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 88.46%. Among the 100 examined features, only 25 were significant. The RF classification results showed a kappa coefficient (kappa) of 0.84 in the first study area. The transferability and scalability of the best-performing features based on ABC FS were evaluated in the second study area, which covered a geographically wide scene of 162 km(2). The results for the second study area obtained an OA of 86.78% and a kappa of 0.82. The proposed integrated method is an efficient and promising technique for high-quality LULC mapping of geographically wide areas.

TI  - The El Nino event of 2015-2016: climate anomalies and their impact on groundwater resources in East and Southern Africa
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of climate variability on groundwater storage has received limited attention despite widespread dependence on groundwater as a resource for drinking water, agriculture and industry. Here, we assess the climate anomalies that occurred over Southern Africa (SA) and East Africa, south of the Equator (EASE), during the major El Nino event of 2015-2016, and their associated impacts on groundwater storage, across scales, through analysis of in situ groundwater piezometry and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data. At the continental scale, the El Nino of 2015-2016 was associated with a pronounced dipole of opposing rainfall anomalies over EASE and Southern Africa, north-south of similar to 12 degrees S, a characteristic pattern of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Over Southern Africa the most intense drought event in the historical record occurred, based on an analysis of the cross-scale areal intensity of surface water balance anomalies (as represented by the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index - SPEI), with an estimated return period of at least 200 years and a best estimate of 260 years. Climate risks are changing, and we estimate that anthropogenic warming only (ignoring changes to other climate variables, e.g. precipitation) has approximately doubled the risk of such an extreme SPEI drought event. These surface water balance deficits suppressed groundwater recharge, leading to a substantial groundwater storage decline indicated by both GRACE satellite and piezometric data in the Limpopo basin. Conversely, over EASE during the 2015-2016 El Nino event, anomalously wet conditions were observed with an estimated return period of similar to 10 years, likely moderated by the absence of a strongly positive Indian Ocean zonal mode phase. The strong but not extreme rainy season increased groundwater storage, as shown by satellite GRACE data and rising groundwater levels observed at a site in central Tanzania. We note substantial uncertainties in separating groundwater from total water storage in GRACE data and show that consistency between GRACE and piezometric estimates of groundwater storage is apparent when spatial averaging scales are comparable. These results have implications for sustainable and climate-resilient groundwater resource management, including the potential for adaptive strategies, such as managed aquifer recharge during episodic recharge events.

TI  - Remote sensing of earth's energy budget: synthesis and review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Review
AB  - The Earth's climate is largely determined by its energy budget. Since the 1960s, satellite remote sensing has been used in estimating these energy budget components at both the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and the surface. Besides the broadband sensors that have been traditionally used for monitoring Earth's Energy Budget (EEB), data from a variety of narrowband sensors aboard both polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites have also been extensively employed to estimate the EEB components. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the satellite missions, state-of-the art estimation algorithms and the satellite products, and also synthesizes current understanding of the EEB and spatio-temporal variations. The TOA components include total solar irradiance, reflected shortwave radiation/planetary albedo, outgoing longwave radiation, and energy imbalance. The surface components include incident solar radiation, shortwave albedo, shortwave net radiation, longwave downward and upwelling radiation, land and sea surface temperature, surface emissivity, all-wave net radiation, and sensible and latent heat fluxes. Some challenges, and outlook such as virtual constellation of different satellite sensors, temporal homogeneity tests of long time-series products, algorithms ensemble, and products intercomparison are also discussed.

TI  - A Sentinel in the Crosstalk Between the Nervous and Immune System: The (Immuno)-Proteasome
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The wealth of recent evidence about a bi-directional communication between nerve and immune- cells revolutionized the traditional concept about the brain as an "immune-privileged" organ while opening novel avenues in the pathophysiology of CNS disorders. In fact, altered communication between the immune and nervous system is emerging as a common hallmark in neuro-developmental, neurodegenerative, and neuro-immunological diseases. At molecular level, the ubiquitin proteasome machinery operates as a sentinel at the crossroad between the immune system and brain. In fact, the standard proteasome and its alternative/inducible counterpart, the immunoproteasome, operate dynamically and coordinately in both nerve- and immune- cells to modulate neurotransmission, oxidative/inflammatory stress response, and immunity. When dysregulations of the proteasome system occur, altered amounts of standard- vs. immune-proteasome subtypes translate into altered communication between neurons, glia, and immune cells. This contributes to neuro-inflammatory pathology in a variety of neurological disorders encompassing Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntingtin's diseases, brain trauma, epilepsy, and Multiple Sclerosis. In the present review, we analyze those proteasome-dependent molecular interactions which sustain communication between neurons, glia, and brain circulating T-lymphocytes both in baseline and pathological conditions. The evidence here discussed converges in that upregulation of immunoproteasome to the detriment of the standard proteasome, is commonly implicated in the inflammatory- and immune- biology of neurodegeneration. These concepts may foster additional studies investigating the role of immunoproteasome as a potential target in neurodegenerative and neuro-immunological disorders.

TI  - Landslide detection in La Paz City (Bolivia) based on time series analysis of InSAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geologically, La Paz City is located in an unstable area. During the history of La Paz city, many landslides have destroyed houses and valuable infrastructures. In the last decades, time series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technologies have demonstrated a great capacity for detecting slow ground displacement, achieving an accuracy of millimetre-level. In order to have a better landslide monitoring of La Paz city, in this study, the Sentinel-1 SAR images have been processed by Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) techniques. The time span of the datasets is from March 2015 to August 2016. Both ascending and descending Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images have been processed to obtain the line of sight (LOS) ground velocity, and then the results have been combined to estimate the up-down and east-west displacement. Several active movement areas have been identified, showing a surface velocity up to 158 mm year(-1) westward and 49 mm year(-1) eastward. Furthermore, two important findings have been discovered. First, the InSAR result has detected movement in Auquisamaa hill before the area collapsed (15 February 2017), where five houses are buried. Second, the InSAR result has identified that there are still some unstable sites in Callapa area, where a mega-landslide has destroyed more than a thousand of houses in February 2011. In conclusion, we have verified that the InSAR technology could be a very useful tool to help La Paz public institutions for a better management of urban planning, landslide areas delimitation and landslide risk mitigation.

TI  - Topographic connection method for automated mapping of landslide inventories, study case: semi urban sub-basin from Monterrey, Northeast of Mexico
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - By nature, slopes are conformed by forces that are in constant balance. Altering this natural balance causes the sliding of soil towards lower zones. Landslides are a constant danger that compromises the general welfare of society. Landslides mapping is especially important for urban areas or development plans. The innovative aspect of this study is the creation of the Topographic Connection Method (TPCM) to automatically map landslides using two types of landslides 1) falls and 2) flows. TPCM cartography results were compared to a previously proven method (Contour Connection Method), as well as to the manual inventory method. Each method was run four times to locate changes through time by using satellite imagery, digital elevations models and 3D relief visualizations with data covering a period from 2012 to 2017. Results showed both falls and flows with all three methods and demonstrated that TPCM can improve mapping accuracy by up to 14%.

TI  - Crop biomass estimation using multi regression analysis and neural networks from multitemporal L-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass has a direct relationship with agricultural production and may help to predict crop yield. Earth observation technology can contribute significantly to monitoring given the availability of temporally frequent and high-resolution radar or optical satellite data. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) has several advantages for operational monitoring given that at these longer wavelengths atmospheric and illumination conditions do not affect acquisitions and considering the sensitivity of microwaves to the structural properties of targets. Therefore, SARs are a promising source of data for crop mapping and monitoring. With increasing access to SARs the development of robust methods to monitor crop productivity is timely.In this paper, we examine the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches to analyze a time series of Polarimetric parameters for crop biomass estimation. In total, 14 polarimetric parameters from a time series of Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) airborne L-band data were used for biomass estimation for an intensively cropped site in western Canada. Then, Multiple linear regression (MR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed and evaluated to estimate the biomass for canola, corn, and soybeans. According to the experimental results, the ANN provided more accurate biomass estimates compared to MR.Canola biomass, in general, showed less sensibility to almost all the polarimetric parameters. Nevertheless, Freeman-Double combined with vertical-vertical backscattering (VV) delivered the correlation coefficient (r) of 0.72, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 56.55 g m(-2) of canola biomass. For corn, the highest correlation was observed between a pairing of horizontal-horizontal backscattering (HH) with Entropy (H) for biomass estimation yielding an r of 0.92 and RMSE of 196.71 g m(-2). Horizontal-vertical backscattering (HV) and Yamaguchi-Surface (O-Y) delivered the highest sensitivity for soybeans (r of 0.82 and RMSE of 13.48 g m(-2)). If all crops are pooled, H combined with O-Y provided the most accurate estimates of biomass (r of 0.89 and RMSE of 135.31 g m(-2)). These results demonstrated that models which make use of polarimetric parameters that characterize the multiple sources of scattering typical of vegetation canopies can be used to estimate crop biomass accurately. Such results bode well for agricultural monitoring considering the increasing number of satellite SAR sensors with various frequencies, imaging modes and revisit times. As such, the time series analysis and methods proposed in this study could be used to monitor crop development and productivity using SAR space technologies.

TI  - Sensitivity of Inherent Optical Properties From Ocean Reflectance Inversion Models to Satellite Instrument Wavelength Suites
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth science community seeks to develop climate data records (CDRs) from satellite measurements of ocean color, a continuous data record that now exceeds 20 years. Space agencies will launch additional instruments in the coming decade that will continue this data record, including the NASA PACE spectrometer. Inherent optical properties (IOPs) quantitatively describe the absorbing and scattering constituents of seawater and can be estimated from satellite-observed spectroradiometric data using semi-analytical algorithms (SAAs). SAAs exploit the contrasting optical signatures of constituent matter at spectral bands observed by satellite sensors. SAA performance, therefore, depends on the spectral resolution of the satellite spectroradiometer. A CDR spanning SeaWiFS, MODIS, OLCI, and PACE, for example, would include IOPs derived using varied wavelength suites if all available wavelengths were considered. Here, we explored differences in derived IOPs that stem simply from the use of (eight) different wavelength suites of input radiometric measurements. Using synthesized data and SeaWiFS Level-3 mission-long composites, we demonstrated equivalent SAA performance for all wavelength suites, but that IOP retrievals vary by several percent across wavelength suites and as a function of water type. The differences equate to roughly <= 6, 12, and 7% for a(dg)(443), a(ph)(443), and b(bp)(443), respectively, for waters with C-a <= 1 mg m(-3). These values shrink for sensors with similar wavelength suites (e.g., SeaWiFS, MODIS, and MERIS) and rise to substantially larger values for higher Ca waters. Our results also indicate that including 400 nm (in the case of OLCI) influences the derived IOPs, using longer wavelengths (>600 nm) influences the derived IOPs when there is a red signal, and, including additional spectral information shows potential for improved IOP estimation, but not without revisiting SAA parameterizations and execution. While modest in scope, we believe this study contributes to the knowledge base for CDR development. The implication of ignoring such an analysis as CDRs continue to be developed is a prolonged inability to distinguish between algorithmic and environmental contributions to trends and anomalies in the IOP time-series.

TI  - Extracting multi-features and optimizing feature space with sparse auto-encoder over WorldView-2 images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature selection of very high-resolution (VHR) images is a key prerequisite for supervised classification. However, it is always difficult to acquire the features which have the highest correlation to the type of land cover for improving classification accuracy. To address this problem, this paper proposed a methodology of feature selection using the results of multiple segmentation via genetic algorithm (GA) and correlation feature selection (CFS) integrating sparse auto-encoder (SAE). Firstly, 61 features, including spectral features and spatial features, are extracted from the results of multi-scale segmentation over a WorldView-2 image in Xicheng District, Beijing. Then, 40-dimensional features and 30-dimensional features are derived from the selection with GA+CFS and the optimization with SAE, respectively. Thirdly, the final classification is achieved by logistic regression (LR) based on different subsets of features extracted from the WorldView-2 image. It is found that the result of feature selection could contribute to increase in the intra-species separation and reduction in the inner-species variability. Adding extra lower-ranked features appeared to reduce the accuracy of classification. The results indicate that the overall classification accuracy with 30-dimensional features reached 87.56%, and increased 5.61% compared to the results with 61-dimensional features. For the two kinds of optimized features, the Z-test values are all greater than 1.96, which implied that feature dimensionality reduction and feature space optimization could significantly improve the accuracy of image land cover classification. The texture features in the wavelet domain are the most important features for the study area in the WorldView-2 image classification. Adding wavelet and the grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) information, especially for GLCM features in wavelet, appeared not to improve classification accuracy. The SAE-based method can produce feature subsets for improving mapping accuracy more efficiently.

TI  - Ontologies to interpret remote sensing images: why do we need them?
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of new sensors and easier access to remote sensing data are significantly transforming both the theory and practice of remote sensing. Although data-driven approaches based on innovative algorithms and enhanced computing capacities are gaining importance to process big Earth Observation data, the development of knowledge-driven approaches is still considered by the remote sensing community to be one of the most important directions of their research. In this context, the future of remote sensing science should be supported by knowledge representation techniques such as ontologies. However, ontology-based remote sensing applications still have difficulty capturing the attention of remote sensing experts. This is mainly because of the gap between remote sensing experts' expectations of ontologies and their real possible contribution to remote sensing. This paper provides insights to help reduce this gap. To this end, the conceptual limitations of the knowledge-driven approaches currently used in remote sensing science are clarified first. Then, the different modes of definition of geographic concepts, their duality, vagueness and ambiguity, and the sensory and semantic gaps are discussed in order to explain why ontologies can help address these limitations. In particular, this paper focuses on the capacity of ontologies to represent both symbolic and numeric knowledge, to reason based on cognitive semantics and to share knowledge on the interpretation of remote sensing images. Finally, a few recommendations are provided for remote sensing experts to comprehend the advantages of ontologies in interpreting satellite images.

TI  - Land-use and land-cover classification using Sentinel-2 data and machine-learning algorithms: operational method and its implementation for a mountainous area of Nepal
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of land-use and land-cover (LULC) classification, there is a lack of leverage of the recent increase of the ease of access to satellite imagery data, cloud computing platforms, and classification techniques. We present both the development of an operational method for LULC classification that considers these progresses and the implementation of this operational method for a mountainous area of Nepal. The operational method allows the comparison of three LULC maps, each derived with a different classification technique [classification and regression tree (CART), max entropy (MaxEnt), and random forest (RF)] applied to Sentinel-2 data on the Google Earth Engine platform. The results derived with the RF technique have the highest overall accuracy coefficient (92%). The probabilities that the RF technique produces a more accurate LULC map than the MaxEnt (95%) and CART (61%) techniques are based on Kappa statistics. Results of general linear models suggest that some LULC types have higher producer's and user's accuracies at a statistically significant level. The operational method can help the producers of LULC maps conduct future work on areas in developing countries, as such contributing to addressing various issues that involve land use.

TI  - Global Relationships Between River Width, Slope, Catchment Area, Meander Wavelength, Sinuosity, and Discharge
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using river centerlines created with Landsat images and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model, we created spatially continuous maps of mean annual flow river width, slope, meander wavelength, sinuosity, and catchment area for all rivers wider than 90 m located between 60 degrees N and 56 degrees S. We analyzed the distributions of these properties, identified their typical ranges, and explored relationships between river planform and slope. We found width to be directly associated with the magnitude of meander wavelength and catchment area. Moreover, we found that narrower rivers show a larger range of slope and sinuosity values than wider rivers. Finally, by comparing simulated discharge from a water balance model with measured widths, we show that power laws between mean annual discharge and width can predict width typically to -35% to +81%, even when a single relationship is applied across all rivers with discharge ranging from 100 to 50,000 m(3)/s.Plain Language Summary For years, scientists and engineers have been using aerial photography to study the shapes of rivers, how they change over time, and how they relate to other river characteristics, such as river width, the slope of the water surface, and flow. These studies served as basis for the development of theories describing erosion, sediment transport, the speed at which flood waves travel through a basin, and serving as guidance for the measurement of river flow. However, such studies were often conducted in person, or done by combining results from other authors, leading to a very limited coverage of world rivers, most of which were in North America. As images of world rivers obtained by satellites became available and adequate computational power became affordable, we were able to describe the shape of worldwide rivers and how other properties, such as slope, width, and flow relate to meander characteristics. We showed that although classical geomorphic studies had limited geographical coverage, their results could generally be applied to typical rivers over the world. Additionally, with our results, rivers with atypical meander characteristics can be better identified, allowing the advancement of our understanding of how rivers work.

T2  - PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), Emirates Mars Mission (EMM), and possible future Mars stationary satellite(s) will provide innovative data products on the optical depth of dust and water ice clouds in the Martian atmosphere with a temporal resolution of hours. The science phase of TGO has begun in April 2018, and the EMM science operation is scheduled to start in 2021. In this work, the relationship between TGO, EMM, and precursor missions/instruments is analyzed based on the obtained data products. This is followed by discussing the foreseen innovation from the latter in the fields of Martian climatology and numerical weather forecasting.

TI  - Freshwater marsh classification in the Lower Parana River floodplain: an object-based approach on multitemporal X-band COSMO-SkyMed data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A multitemporal approach to discriminate freshwater macrophyte vegetation types in the Lower Parana River floodplain is addressed. During a low-intensity flood pulse, seven X-band HH COSMO-SkyMed Hlmage images are acquired, covering a nine-month period. Scenes are segmented with a mean-shift segmentation algorithm. Objects are classified with an expectation maximization algorithm into clusters with different temporal signatures and are assigned to six information classes: water, bulrush marshes, short broad-leaf marshes, tall broad-leaf marshes, short grasslands and grass marshes, and tall grasslands and grass marshes. Class interpretation is based on backscatter dynamics, with focus on their correlation with hydrometric water level measured in the Parana River and/or with the floodplain area covered by water as estimated with a normalized difference vegetation index threshold criterion. The obtained product has a global accuracy of 75.4% and a kappa index of 67.2%. We point out the usefulness of X-band for flood monitoring and macrophyte vegetation type discrimination. However, we find limitations for the discrimination between high-biomass vegetation targets, such as tall broad-leaf marshes and tall grasslands. In a mosaic of herbaceous wetlands, the knowledge on the relation between vegetation and floods is essential for interpreting and predicting how back-scattering coefficients and other synthetic aperture radar-derivated parameters vary with flooding.

TI  - Monitoring and assimilation tests with TROPOMI data in the CAMS system: near-real-time total column ozone
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite launched in October 2017 yields a wealth of atmospheric composition data, including retrievals of total column ozone (TCO3) that are provided in near-real-time (NRT) and off line. The NRT TCO3 retrievals (v1.0.0-v1.1.2) have been included in the data assimilation system of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), and tests to monitor the data and to carry out first assimilation experiments with them have been performed for the period 26 November 2017 to 30 November 2018. The TROPOMI TCO3 data agree to within 2 % with the CAMS analysis over large parts of the globe between 60 degrees N and 60 degrees S and also with TCO3 retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) that are routinely assimilated by CAMS. However, the TCO3 NRT data from TROPOMI show some retrieval anomalies at high latitudes, at low solar elevations and over snow/ice (e.g. Antarctica and snow-covered land areas in the Northern Hemisphere), where the differences with the CAMS analysis and the other data sets are larger. These differences are particularly pronounced over land in the NH during winter and spring (when they can reach up to 40 DU) and come mainly from the surface albedo climatology that is used in the NRT TROPOMI TCO3 retrieval. This climatology has a coarser horizontal resolution than the TROPOMI TCO3 data, which leads to problems in areas where there are large changes in reflectivity from pixel to pixel, e.g. pixels covered by snow/ice or not. The differences between TROPOMI and the CAMS analysis also show some dependency on scan position.The assimilation of TROPOMI TCO3 has been tested in the CAMS system for data between 60 degrees N and 60 degrees S and for solar elevations greater than 10 degrees and is found to have a small positive impact on the ozone analysis compared to Brewer TCO3 data and an improved fit to ozone sondes in the tropical troposphere and to LAGOS aircraft profiles at West African airports. The impact of the TROPOMI data is relatively small because the CAMS analysis is already well constrained by several other ozone retrievals that are routinely assimilated. When averaged over the periods February-April and September-October 2018, differences between experiments with and without assimilation of TROPOMI data are less than 2 % for TCO3 and less than 3 % in the vertical for seasonal mean zonal mean O-3 mixing ratios, with the largest relative differences found in the troposphere.

TI  - <i>Bartonella</i> Bacteria in Urban Rats: A Movement From the Jungles of Southeast Asia to Metropoles Around the Globe
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite the widespread recognition of the risks of disease transmission associated with international trade in domestic animals and movement of exotic animals, less is known about the role of rats in carrying pathogens between continents. The genus Bartonella, a highly prevalent and extremely diverse group of bacteria, includes species that are excellent sentinel organisms for evaluating the transoceanic and intra-continental movement of the pathogens carried by rats of the genus Rattus. The patterns of spatial distribution, occurrence, and genetic diversity of Bartonella species infecting rats and their arthropod ectoparasites depend on the geographic locations within metropolitan areas of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. One of the points addressed in this review is a comparison of the diversity of Bartonella species carried by rats in their original habitats in Southeast Asia and in the cities occupied by rats recently. The invasion of Rattus rats into new urban territories create significant risk for human health.

TI  - Exploring <i>Campylobacter</i> seasonality across Europe using The European Surveillance System (TESSy), 2008 to 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Campylobacteriosis is the most commonly reported food-borne infection in the European Union, with an annual number of cases estimated at around 9 million. In many countries, campylobacteriosis has a striking seasonal peak during early/mid-summer. In the early 2000s, several publications reported on campylobacteriosis seasonality across Europe and associations with temperature and precipitation. Subsequently, many European countries have introduced new measures against this food-borne disease. Aim: To examine how the seasonality of campylobacteriosis varied across Europe from 2008-16, to explore associations with temperature and precipitation, and to compare these results with previous studies. We also sought to assess the utility of the European Surveillance System TESSy for cross-European seasonal analysis of campylobacteriosis. Methods: Ward's Minimum Variance Clustering was used to group countries with similar seasonal patterns of campylobacteriosis. A two-stage multivariate meta-analysis methodology was used to explore associations with temperature and precipitation. Results: Nordic countries had a pronounced seasonal campylobacteriosis peak in mid- to late summer (weeks 29-32), while most other European countries had a less pronounced peak earlier in the year. The United Kingdom, Ireland, Hungary and Slovakia had a slightly earlier peak (week 24). Campylobacteriosis cases were positively associated with temperature and, to a lesser degree, precipitation. Conclusion: Across Europe, the strength and timing of campylobacteriosis peaks have remained similar to those observed previously. In addition, TESSy is a useful resource for cross-European seasonal analysis of infectious diseases such as campylobacteriosis, but its utility depends upon each country's reporting infrastructure.

TI  - Fast active learning for hyperspectral image classification using extreme learning machine
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to undulating and complexity of the earth's surface, obtaining the training samples for remote sensing data is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is highly desirable to design a model that uses as few labelled samples as possible and reducing the computational time. Several active learning (AL) algorithms have been proposed in the literature for the classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs). However, its performance in terms of computational time has not been focused yet. Here, the authors have proposed AL approach based on extreme learning machine (ELM) that effectively decreases the computational time while maintaining the classification accuracy. Further, the effectiveness of the proposed approach has been depicted by comparing its performance with state-of-the-art AL algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and computational time as well. The ELM-based AL with different query strategies were conducted on two HSI data sets. The proposed approach achieves the classification accuracy up to 90% which is comparable to support vector machine-based AL approach but effectively reduces the computational time significantly by 1000 times. Thus, the proposed system shows the encouraging results with adequate classification accuracy while reducing the computation time drastically.

TI  - Surface water classification from GF-4 images using a time series water index
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although satellite remote sensing imagery is suitable for mapping and monitoring the surface water, the application of surface water classification techniques in the literatures is still constrained by low accuracy in various situations. As the GF-4 satellite is one of the few moderate spatial resolution geostationary orbit remote sensing satellites, the purpose of this study is to introduce a method that consistently improves the accuracy of surface water classification by utilizing the temporal characteristics of the dense time series of GF-4 images. A new time series water index called the spectrum and solar altitude angle water index (SSWI) is proposed based on the characteristics of the variation in the top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance with the change in solar altitude angle in the near-infrared (NIR) band of GF-4 images. The thresholding technique is applied to the SSWI map to automatically extract surface water. The performance of the SSWI method for surface water classification is validated and compared with the results of two widely used water classification methods, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and maximum likelihood (ML) classifier, at four representative sites in different parts of China, including Beijing, Hubei, Tibet and Guangdong. The results show that at all four test sites, the classification accuracy of SSWI is significantly higher than that of NDWI and ML. Averaged over the four test sites, the total error of the SSWI for water bodies is only approximately 36.9% of that of the NDWI method and 23.5% of that of the ML classifier. In particular, the SSWI method shows outstanding performance in terms of distinguishing surface water from backgrounds that are usually sources of surface water classification errors, e.g. mountain shadows and low-albedo built-up areas. Therefore, the SSWI method can be used to classify surface water from GF-4 images and holds the potential to be a useful surface water classification technology for water resource studies and applications.

TI  - 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> Restrains CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T Cell Priming Ability of CD11c<SUP>+</SUP> Dendritic Cells by Upregulating Expression of CD31
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dendritic cells (DC) are specialized sentinel cells that bridge the innate and adaptive immune response and play a crucial role in shaping the adaptive immune response. Vitamin D, a known epidemiological risk factor for the development of several autoimmune diseases, influences the development of dendritic cells. Consequently, vitamin D metabolites are frequently used in protocols to develop therapeutic dendritic cell therapies for autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanisms by which vitamin D modulates DC function remain poorly understood. We investigated the effects of vitamin D on murine CD11c(+) bone marrow derived DC (BMDC) function by analyzing global gene expression in CD11c(+) BMDC generated in the presence (VitD-CD11c(+) BMDC) or absence (Veh-CD11c(+) BMDC) of the active vitamin D metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1,25(OH)(2)D-3). Seven genes were significantly increased in expression in both immature and LPS-matured VitD-CD11c(+) BMDC, one of which was CD31, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Gene knockdown of CD31 enhanced the ability of VitD-CD11c(+) BMDC to prime naive CD4(+) T cells in vitro; conversely, increased expression of CD31 on vehicle treated CD11c(+) BMDC restrained their T cell priming abilities. Time-lapse imaging of BMDC and CD4(+) T cells during in vitro priming revealed that CD31 reduced the BMDC-T cell interaction time. Finally, we confirmed a similar effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 on human CD34(+) cell-derived CD11c(+) DC, whereby DC generated in the presence of 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 had increased CD31 expression. In summary, we show that both mouse and human DC generated in the presence of 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 upregulate CD31 expression, resulting in a reduced ability to prime CD4(+) T cells by impairing a stable cell-cell contact.

TI  - Cluster-Based Evaluation of Model Compensating Errors: A Case Study of Cloud Radiative Effect in the Southern Ocean
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Model evaluation is difficult and generally relies on analysis that can mask compensating errors. This paper defines new metrics, using clusters generated from a machine learning algorithm, to estimate mean and compensating errors in different model runs. As a test case, we investigate the Southern Ocean shortwave radiative bias using clusters derived by applying self-organizing maps to satellite data. In particular, the effects of changing cloud phase parameterizations in the MetOffice Unified Model are examined. Differences in cluster properties show that the regional radiative biases are substantially different than the global bias, with two distinct regions identified within the Southern Ocean, each with a different signed bias. Changing cloud phase parameterizations can reduce errors at higher latitudes but increase errors at lower latitudes of the Southern Ocean. Ranking the parameterizations often shows a contrast in mean and compensating errors, notably in all cases large compensating errors remain.

TI  - Evidence of Environmental Changes Caused by Chinese Island-Building
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper quantifies environmental effects of island-building operations in the South China Sea, which result from dredging and can negatively impact marine flora, fauna, and ecosystems. The extent of the damage caused by island-creation is believed to be large, as the South China Sea reefs support the largest concentration of marine biodiversity on Earth. Through use of satellite imagery, we investigate the island-construction on Mischief Reef in the South China Sea, showing backscatter increases of up to 350% in waters surrounding the reef, with plumes of excess sediment exceeding 250 km(2) at times during island-construction, and the cumulative area impacted by dredging exceeding 1,200 km(2). Comparison of satellite-derived chlorophyll-a, backscatter, absorption and remote sensing reflectance at 412 nm suggest that dredging activities led to a decrease in biological health of the region resulting from the smothering of natural benthic habitats and reef complexes with sediment. We anticipate this ex post facto quantification of the connectivity between island-construction, large particulate plumes and a decrease in absorption related to marine life in the water column to establish a starting point for further study into ecosystem impact. The potential associations between these damages and a long-term reduction in ocean life and resources could serve inter-governmental bodies with a baseline metric for evaluating the level of damage caused. This may result in both forward-looking deterrent policies that limit island-building as well as backward-looking compensation.

TI  - Geocide, Ecocide, and Genocidal Type Outcomes from Large-Scale Open Pit Mountaintop Gold Mining in the Outskirts of Paracatu, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1987, large-scale open pit mountaintop gold mining was initiated in the outskirts of the Paracatu town, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The mine hard rocks contain low-grade gold ore (average 0.4 g gold/ton ore) and abnormally high amounts of arsenopyrite (FeAsS; average 1000 g/ton ore). Since 2005, the mine has been operated solely by Canadian Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC-NYSE, K-TSX) through its local subsidiary. The poorly controlled mining activities release FeAsS and its weathering products from the rocks as particulate matter, gas, and solutes that contaminate the air, soils, surface water and ground water. As of 2016, the cumulative inorganic arsenic throughput of the mine was estimated at 735,000 ton. In this article, we present the first series of sentinel cases of chronic arsenic intoxication (CAsI) in Paracatu. Despite mounting evidence for wanton widespread environmental degradation, large-scale environmental contamination, chronic mass intoxication, and persistent human rights abuse, a number of public and private lawsuits failed to halt Kinross' activities in Paracatu. The ongoing environmental and humanitarian disaster and unlawful abuses in Paracatu that degrade the environment and victimize thousands of people have prospered unchallenged and cannot be stopped locally due to officials' collusion with large economic interests, powerful political interferences, facilitation payments, willful blindness, and toxicological greenwashing.

TI  - Combining European Earth Observation products with Dynamic Global Vegetation Models for estimating Essential Biodiversity Variables
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global, fast and accessible monitoring of biodiversity is one of the main pillars of the efforts undertaken in order to revert it loss. The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO-BON) provided an expert-based definition of the biological properties that should be monitored, the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs). Initiatives to provide indicators for EBVs rely on global, freely available remote sensing (RS) products in combination with empirical models and field data, and are invaluable for decision making. In this study, we provide alternatives for the expansion and improvement of the EBV indicators, by suggesting current and future data from the European Space Agenc COPERNICUS and explore the potential of RS-integrated Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) for the estimation of EBVs. Our review found that mainly due to the inclusion of the Sentinel constellation, Copernicus products have similar or superior potential for EBV indicator estimation in relation to their NASA counterparts. DGVMs simulate the ecosystem level EBVs (ecosystem function and structure), and when integrated with remote sensing data have great potential to not only offer improved estimation of current states but to provide projection of ecosystem impacts. We suggest that focus on producing EBV relevant outputs should be a priority within the research community, to support biodiversity preservation efforts.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Response to Irrigated Paddy Field Expansion: a Case Study of Semi-arid Western Jilin Province, China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The irrigated paddy fields have expanded greatly at semi-arid western Jilin province of China in recent over ten years, the sources of which are rain-fed cornfields, swamp meadow and saline alkali land mainly. Based on regional land use data, remote sensing data and meteorological data, this paper evaluates the land surface temperature changes response to land surface biophysical processes changes resulting from land use change (LUC), and dissociates the effect of radiative change (albedo) and non-radiative change (evapotranspiration and turbulent process) quantitatively using the energy redistribution factor. The results show that, the total land surface temperature changes based on energy redistribution factor are consistent with that based on remote sensing data on the whole, which have significant and different seasonal variations for agriculture adjustment of rain-fed cornfields to irrigated paddy fields and nature land reclamation. Generally, the largest Land surface temperature changes (Delta Ts) are most pronounced in May and June for agriculture adjustment of rain-fed cornfields to irrigated paddy fields, which is -1.85 K averagely. Notable decline of albedo from saline alkali land to irrigated paddy fields in April to June greatly counteracts the cooling effect of non-radiative processes changes, while the largest Delta Ts is found of -2. 54 K in dry summer months of July and August. For swamp meadows to irrigated paddy fields, non-radiative process is strengthened from June to September, the cooling effect of which is -1.69 K averagely. This study provides a case reference of local temperature change and obvious changes of land surface non-radiative terms at semi-arid area for adjustment of agricultural activities and land use changes.

TI  - Cloud Heterogeneity in the Marine Midlatitudes: Dependence on Large-Scale Meteorology and Implications for General Circulation Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine the sensitivity of cloud heterogeneity to large-scale meteorology in the marine midlatitudes using satellite observations from the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instruments aboard the Terra satellite and nudged simulations from the UK Met Office's Global Atmosphere 7.0 (GA7) for the year 2007. Using Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer observations, we quantify several sources of observational uncertainty due to cloud heterogeneity such as finite-resolution cloud fraction biases and subpixel heterogeneity. With a simple measure of cloud geometry, we show that these sources of observational uncertainty are maximized in post-cold-frontal conditions, where scattered subpixel clouds are frequent, and are minimized in the warm sector, where subpixel clouds are infrequent. These results demonstrate the greater difficulty in interpreting remote sensing measurements in post-cold-frontal conditions compared to quiescent or warm-sector conditions. We show that the neglect of this observational uncertainty can qualitatively alter the interpretation of how cloud properties respond to large-scale meteorology in GA7 and general circulation models in general. However, conservative application of the satellite data still allows robust evaluation of the simulated clouds. For overcast domains, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer observations show that overcast cloud heterogeneity is independent of large-scale meteorology. However, heterogeneity increases when moving from warm sector to post-cold-frontal conditions in GA7. GA7 overestimates the heterogeneity of the low-topped clouds that populate these regimes. For overcast domains, this bias is equivalent to a 15% underestimation in the mean cloud optical depth. These results suggest a systematic error in the subgrid-scale variability parameterization, which, when corrected, will improve the simulation of the midlatitudes in GA7.

TI  - Recovering Land Surface Temperature Under Cloudy Skies Considering the Solar-Cloud-Satellite Geometry: Application to MODIS and Landsat-8 Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds play a significant role in the derivation of land surface temperature (LST) from optical remote sensing. The estimation of LST under cloudy sky conditions has been a great challenge for the community for a long time. In this study, a scheme for recovering the LST under cloudy skies is proposed by accounting for the solar-cloud-satellite geometry effect, through which the LSTs of shadowed and illuminated pixels covered by clouds in the image are estimated. The validation shows that the new scheme can work well and has reasonable LST accuracy with a root mean square error<4.9K and bias<3.5K. The application of the new method to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat-8 data reveals that the LSTs under cloud layers can be reasonably recovered and that the fraction of valid LSTs in an image can be correspondingly improved. The method is not data specific; instead, it can be used in any optical remote sensing images as long as the proper input variables are provided. As an alternative approach to derive cloudy sky LSTs based only on optical remote sensing data, it gives some new ideas to the remote sensing community, especially in the fields of surface energy balance.

TI  - Radiometric calibration of a non-imaging airborne spectrometer to measure the Greenland ice sheet surface
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods to radiometrically calibrate a non-imaging airborne visible-to-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) spectrometer to measure the Greenland ice sheet surface are presented. Airborne VSWIR measurement performance for bright Greenland ice and dark bare rock/soil targets is compared against the MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN (R)) radiative transfer code (version 6.0), and a coincident Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) acquisition on 29 July 2015 during an in-flight radiometric calibration experiment. Airborne remote sensing flights were carried out in northwestern Greenland in preparation for the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) laser altimeter mission. A total of nine science flights were conducted over the Greenland ice sheet, sea ice, and open-ocean water. The campaign's primary purpose was to correlate green laser pulse penetration into snow and ice with spectroscopic-derived surface properties. An experimental airborne instrument configuration that included a nadir-viewing (looking downward at the surface) non-imaging Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) Inc. spectrometer that measured upwelling VSWIR (0.35 to 2.5 mu m) spectral radiance (W m(-2) sr(-1) mu m(-1)) in the two-color Slope Imaging Multi-polarization Photon-Counting Lidar's (SIMPL) ground instantaneous field of view, and a zenith-viewing (looking upward at the sky) ASD spectrometer that measured VSWIR spectral irradiance (W m(-2) nm(-1)) was flown. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable radiometric calibration procedures for laboratory, in-flight, and field environments are described in detail to achieve a targeted VSWIR measurement requirement of within 5 % to support calibration/validation efforts and remote sensing algorithm development. Our MODTRAN predictions for the 29 July flight line over dark and bright targets indicate that the airborne nadir-viewing spectrometer spectral radiance measurement uncertainty was between 0.6 % and 4.7 % for VSWIR wavelengths (0.4 to 2.0 mu m) with atmospheric transmittance greater than 80 %. MODTRAN predictions for Landsat 8 OLI relative spectral response functions suggest that OLI is measuring 6 % to 16 % more top-of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance from the Greenland ice sheet surface than was predicted using apparent reflectance spectra from the nadir-viewing spectrometer. While more investigation is required to convert airborne VSWIR spectral radiance into atmospherically corrected airborne surface reflectance, it is expected that airborne science flight data products will contribute to spectroscopic determination of Greenland ice sheet surface optical properties to improve understanding of their potential influence on ICESat-2 measurements.

TI  - Characterization of bottom sediment resuspension events observed in a micro-tidal bay
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we investigate the variability in near-bottom turbidity in Alfacs Bay (in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea). The bay is characterized by a micro-tidal environment and seiching activity that may lead to flow velocities of more than 50 cm s(-1). A set of current meters and optical sensors were mounted near the sea bottom to acquire synchronous hydrodynamic and optical information from the water column. The time-series observations showed an evident relation between seiche activity and sediment resuspension events. The observations of turbidity peaks are consistent with the node-antinode location of the fundamental and first resonance periods of the bay. The implementation of a coupled wave-current numerical model shows strong spatial variability of the potential resuspension locations. Strong wind events are also a mechanism responsible for the resuspension of fine sediment within the bay. This is confirmed by suspended sediment concentration maps derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. We suggest that the sequence of resuspension events plays an important role in the suspended sediment concentration, meaning that the occurrence of sediment resuspension events may increase the suspended sediment in subsequent events. The suspended sediment events likely affect the ecological status of the bay and the sedimentary process over a long-term period.

TI  - The angular characteristics of Moon-based Earth observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, is a potential new platform for Earth observation. Moreover, with the wide applicability of the angular information from remote sensing data, it has been attracting increasingly more attention. Accordingly, this study focuses on the angular characteristics of Moon-based Earth observations. Using ephemeris DE430 and Earth orientation parameters, the position and attitude of the Sun, Earth, and Moon were obtained and their coordinates normalized to a single framework using coordinate transformations between the related reference systems. Then, an angular geometric model of Moon-based Earth observations was constructed, and the corresponding angular algorithms were presented. The results revealed the angular range and distribution characteristics of Moon-based Earth observations. For every point on the surface of the Earth, the view and solar zenith angles all vary widely, which decreases with increasing latitude. The view and solar zenith angles all vary widely with the largest range of values in the equatorial and polar regions and a smaller range of values in mid-latitudes. Furthermore, the range of solar angles of Moon-based Earth observations is the same as that of all-time solar angles, indicating the potential for monitoring and understanding large-scale geoscientific phenomena using Moon-based Earth observations.

TI  - Glacier Changes in the Qilian Mountains, Northwest China, between the 1960s and 2015
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the Qilian Mountains are important sources of fresh-water for sustainable development in the Hexi Corridor in the arid northwest China. Over the last few decades, glaciers have generally shrunk across the globe due to climate warming. In order to understand the current state of glaciers in the Qilian Mountains, we compiled a new inventory of glaciers in the region using Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) images acquired in 2015, and identified 2748 glaciers that covered an area of 1539.30 +/- 49.50 km(2) with an ice volume of 81.69 +/- 7.40 km(3), among which the Shule River basin occupied the largest portion of glaciers (24.8% in number, 32.3% in area, and 35.6% in ice volume). In comparison to previous inventories, glacier area was found to shrink by 396.89 km(2) (20.5%) in total, and 109 glaciers with an area of 8.94 km(2) disappeared over the period from the 1960s to 2015. This situation was primarily caused by the increase in air temperature, and also related with the size of glacier and some local topographic parameters. In addition, the change of glaciers in the Qilian Mountains showed a distinct spatial pattern, i.e., their shrinking rate was large in the east and small in the west.

TI  - Influence of 3D Spruce Tree Representation on Accuracy of Airborne and Satellite Forest Reflectance Simulated in DART
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in high-performance computer resources and exploitation of high-density terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data allow for reconstruction of close-to-reality 3D forest scenes for use in canopy radiative transfer models. Consequently, our main objectives were (i) to reconstruct 3D representation of Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees by deriving distribution of woody and foliage elements from TLS and field structure data and (ii) to use the reconstructed 3D spruce representations for evaluation of the effects of canopy structure on forest reflectance simulated in the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. Data for this study were combined from two spruce research sites located in the mountainous areas of the Czech Republic. The canopy structure effects on simulated top-of-canopy reflectance were evaluated for four scenarios (10 x 10 m scenes with 10 trees), ranging from geometrically simple to highly detailed architectures. First scenario A used predefined simple tree crown shapes filled with a turbid medium with simplified trunks and branches. Other three scenarios used the reconstructed 3D spruce representations with B detailed needle shoots transformed into turbid medium, C with simplified shoots retained as facets, and D with detailed needle shoots retained as facets D. For the first time, we demonstrated the capability of the DART model to simulate reflectance of complex coniferous forest scenes up to the level of a single needle (scenario D). Simulated bidirectional reflectance factors extracted for each scenario were compared with actual airborne hyperspectral and space-borne Sentinel-2 MSI reflectance data. Scenario A yielded the largest differences from the remote sensing observations, mainly in the visible and NIR regions, whereas scenarios B, C, and D produced similar results revealing a good agreement with the remote sensing data. When judging the computational requirements for reflectance simulations in DART, scenario B can be considered as most operational spruce forest representation, because the transformation of 3D shoots in turbid medium reduces considerably the simulation time and hardware requirements.

TI  - Linking Terrestrial LiDAR Scanner and Conventional Forest Structure Measurements with Multi-Modal Satellite Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining information on vertical forest structure requires detailed data acquisition and analysis which is often performed at a plot level. With the growing availability of multi-modal satellite remote sensing (SRS) datasets, their usability towards forest structure estimation is increasing. We assessed the relationship of PlanetScope-, Sentinel-2-, and Landsat-7-derived vegetation indices (VIs), as well as ALOS-2 PALSAR-2- and Sentinel-1-derived backscatter intensities with a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and conventionally measured forest structure parameters acquired from 25 field plots in a tropical montane cloud forest in Kafa, Ethiopia. Results showed that canopy gap-related forest structure parameters had their highest correlation (|r| = 0.4 - 0.48) with optical sensor-derived VIs, while vegetation volume-related parameters were mainly correlated with red-edge- and short-wave infrared band-derived VIs (i.e., inverted red-edge chlorophyll index (IRECI), normalized difference moisture index), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatters (|r| = -0.57 - 0.49). Using stepwise multi-linear regression with the Akaike information criterion as evaluation parameter, we found that the fusion of different SRS-derived variables can improve the estimation of field-measured structural parameters. The combination of Sentinel-2 VIs and SAR backscatters was dominant in most of the predictive models, while IRECI was found to be the most common predictor for field-measured variables. The statistically significant regression models were able to estimate cumulative plant area volume density with an R-2 of 0.58 and with the lowest relative root mean square error (RRMSE) value (0.23). Mean gap and number of gaps were also significantly estimated, but with higher RRMSE (R-2 = 0.52, RRMSE = 1.4, R-2 = 0.68, and RRMSE = 0.58, respectively). The models showed poor performance in predicting tree density and number of tree species (R-2 = 0.28, RRMSE = 0.41, and R-2 = 0.21, RRMSE = 0.39, respectively). This exploratory study demonstrated that SRS variables are sensitive to retrieve structural differences of tropical forests and have the potential to be used to upscale biodiversity relevant field-based forest structure estimates.

TI  - Monitoring Spatio-Temporal Changes of Terrestrial Ecosystem Soil Water Use Efficiency in Northeast China Using Time Series Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil water use efficiency (SWUE) was proposed as an effective proxy of ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE), which reflects the coupling of the carbon-water cycle and function of terrestrial ecosystems. The changes of ecosystem SWUE at the regional scale and their relationships with the environmental and biotic factors are yet to be adequately understood. Here, we aim to estimate SWUE over northeast China using time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) gross primary productivity data and European Space Agency climate change initiative (ESA CCI) soil moisture product during 2007-2015. The spatio-temporal variations in SWUE and their linkages to multiple factors, especially the phenological metrics, were investigated using trend and correlation analysis. The results showed that the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem SWUE in northeast China was obvious. SWUE distribution varied among vegetation types, soil types, and elevation. Forests might produce higher photosynthetic productivity by utilizing unit soil moisture. The seasonal variations of SWUE were consistent with the vegetation growth cycle. Changes in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature, and precipitation exerted positive effects on SWUE variations. The earlier start (SOS) and later end (EOS) of the growing season would contribute to the increase in SWUE. Our results help complement the knowledge of SWUE variations and their driving forces.

TI  - Coastline Extraction from SAR Images Using Robust Ridge Tracing
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although ridge tracing has the advantages of continuity and high positioning accuracy compared with other edge-based methods, it is difficult to use ridge tracing to extract coastlines from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images because of the speckle noise that occurs in SAR images. This paper presents a new coastline extraction method for SAR images based on a more robust ridge tracing method. First, according to the statistical properties of the pixel intensities in the land and sea regions in a SAR image, an edge magnitude map that characterizes the boundary between them is produced by the ratio of the variance to the mean such that the magnitude at the land-sea boundary is much higher than that at other locations. Second, the pixel with the maximum magnitude in the map is adopted as the starting point for tracing, and strip windows, which reduce tracing failures, are adopted to obtain different average magnitudes corresponding to the eight neighborhood pixels around the starting point. Then, the neighborhood pixel with the maximum magnitude is adopted as the next tracing point. The above procedure is repeated to determine the direction of the next point. This process achieves part of the tracing operation. The complete coastline is then extracted by performing the other part of the tracing operation. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more robust than traditional methods, and we demonstrate its effectiveness with RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1A data.

TI  - Downscaling Landsat-8 land surface temperature maps in diverse urban landscapes using multivariate adaptive regression splines and very high resolution auxiliary data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH

AB  - We propose a method for spatial downscaling of Landsat 8-derived LST maps from 100(30 m) resolution down to 2-4 m with the use of the Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) models coupled with very high resolution auxiliary data derived from hyperspectral aerial imagery and large-scale topographic maps. We applied the method to four Landsat 8 scenes, two collected in summer and two in winter, for three British towns collectively representing a variety of urban form. We used several spectral indices as well as fractional coverage of water and paved surfaces as LST predictors, and applied a novel method for the correction of temporal mismatch between spectral indices derived from aerial and satellite imagery captured at different dates, allowing for the application of the downscaling method for multiple dates without the need for repeating the aerial survey. Our results suggest that the method performed well for the summer dates, achieving RMSE of 1.40-1.83 K prior to and 0.76-1.21 K after correction for residuals. We conclude that the MARS models, by addressing the non-linear relationship of LST at coarse and fine spatial resolutions, can be successfully applied to produce high resolution LST maps suitable for studies of urban thermal environment at local scales.

TI  - Physical dynamics of Lake Victoria over the past 34 years (1984-2018): Is the lake dying?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding changes in the physical dynamics of lakes (e.g., areas and shorelines) is important to inform policies, planning and management during climate extremes (e.g., floods and droughts). For Lake Victoria, the world's second largest freshwater lake, its physical dynamics and associated changes are not well understood as evidenced, e.g., from the citations of its area 66,400-69,485 km(2), length 300-412 km, width 240-355 km, and shorelines 3300-4828 km. Its sheer size and lack of research resources commitment by regional governments hamper observations. This contribution employs a suite of remotely sensed products for the past 34 years (1984-2018); Landsat, Sentinel-2, MODIS, Google Earth Pro, CHIRPS, Multivariate El' Nino-Southern Oscillation Index and altimetry data together with the physical parameters from 37 publications (1969-2018) to (i) study the lake's dynamics and establish its current (2018) state, (ii) identify and analyse hotspots where significantly dynamic changes occur, and (iii), study the contributions of climate change and anthropogenic activities on these dynamics. Utilizing manual digitisation, MNDWI, NDVI and PCA methods, the study shows the lake's mean surface area to be 69,295 km2 (i.e., 812 km(2) or 1.2% more than that of the 37 publications) and its 2018 value to be 69,216 km2 (i.e., similar to 733 km(2) (1.1%) more than that of the 37 publications). As to whether the lake is dying, it shrunk by 203 km(2) (0.3%) compared to its 1984 value, a decrease noted mainly in four hotspot Gulfs (Birinzi 40%, Winam 20%, Emin Pasha 38% and Mwanza 55%). Correspondingly, the expansion of Nalubaale Dam (2002-2006) decreased the areas by 31%, 10%, 21% and 44%, respectively. Seasonal analysis shows an increase of 9 km(2) in the lake's area during the heavy rainy season (March-May) while the ENSO enlarged the area by 0.23% (2007) and 0.45% (2010). It is evident, therefore, that both climate variability/change and anthropogenic activities are exerting a toll on the tropical's largest freshwater body thereby necessitating careful exploitation and management plans.

TI  - Determining the AMSR-E SST Footprint from Co-Located MODIS SSTs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was undertaken to derive and analyze the advanced microwave scanning radiometer-Earth observing satellite (EOS) (AMSR-E) sea surface temperature (SST) footprint associated with the remote sensing systems (RSS) level-2 (L2) product. The footprint, in this case, is characterized by the weight attributed to each 4x4 km square contributing to the SST value of a given (AMSR-E) pixel. High-resolution L2 SST fields obtained from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), carried on the same spacecraft as AMSR-E, are used as the sub-resolution "ground truth" from which the AMSR-E footprint is determined. Mathematically, the approach is equivalent to a linear inversion problem, and its solution is pursued by means of a constrained least square approximation based on the bootstrap sampling procedure. The method yielded an elliptic-like Gaussian kernel with an aspect ratio approximate to 1.58, very close to the AMSR-E 6.93GHz channel aspect ratio, approximate to 1.74. (The 6.93GHz channel is the primary spectral frequency used to determine SST.) The semi-major axis of the estimated footprint is found to be aligned with the instantaneous field-of-view of the sensor as expected from the geometric characteristics of AMSR-E. Footprints were also analyzed year-by-year and as a function of latitude and found to be stable-no dependence on latitude or on time. Precise knowledge of the footprint is central for any satellite-derived product characterization and, in particular, for efforts to deconvolve the heavily oversampled AMSR-E SST fields and for studies devoted to product validation and comparison. A preliminary analysis suggests that use of the derived footprint will reduce the variance between AMSR-E and MODIS fields compared to the results obtained ignoring the shape and size of the footprint as has been the practice in such comparisons to date.

TI  - Effective Band Ratio of Landsat 8 Images Based on VNIR-SWIR Reflectance Spectra of Topsoils for Soil Moisture Mapping in a Tropical Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective mapping and monitoring of soil moisture content (SMC) in space and time is an expected application of remote sensing for agricultural development and drought mitigation, particularly in the context of global climate change impact, given that agricultural drought is occurring more frequently and severely worldwide. This study aims to develop a regional algorithm for estimating SMC by using Landsat 8 (L8) imagery, based on analyses of the response of soil reflectance, by corresponding L8 bands with the change of SMC from dry to saturated states, in all 103 soil samples taken in the central region of Vietnam. The L8 spectral band ratio of the near-infrared band (NIR: 850-880 nm, band 5) versus the short-wave infrared 2 band (SWIR2: 2110 to 2290 nm, band 7) shows the strongest correlation to SMC by a logarithm function (R-2 = 0.73 and the root mean square error, RMSE similar to 12%) demonstrating the high applicability of this band ratio for estimating SMC. The resultant maps of SMC estimated from the L8 images were acquired over the northern part of the Central Highlands of Vietnam in March 2015 and March 2016 showed an agreement with the pattern of severe droughts that occurred in the region. Further discussions on the relationship between the estimated SMC and the satellite-based retrieved drought index, the Normal Different Drought Index, from the L8 image acquired in March 2016, showed a strong correlation between these two variables within an area with less than 20% dense vegetation (R-2 = 0.78 to 0.95), and co-confirms the bad effect of drought on almost all areas of the northern part of the Central Highlands of Vietnam. Directly estimating SMC from L8 imagery provides more information for irrigation management and better drought mitigation than by using the remotely sensed drought index. Further investigations on various soil types and optical sensors (i.e., Sentinel 2A, 2B) need to be carried out, to extend and promote the applicability of the prosed algorithm, towards better serving agricultural management and drought mitigation.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Change in the Kailash Sacred Landscape of China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover change (LUCC) is an important driver of ecosystem function and services. Thus, LUCC analysis may lay foundation for landscape planning, conservation and management. It is especially true for alpine landscapes, which are more susceptible to climate changes and human activities. However, the information on LUCC in sacred landscape is limited, which will hinder the landscape conservation and development. We chose Kailash Sacred Landscape in China (KSL-China) to investigate the patterns and dynamics of LUCC and the driving forces using remote sensing data and meteorological data from 1990 to 2008. A supervised classification of land use and land cover was established based on field survey. Rangelands presented marked fluctuations due to climatic warming and its induced drought, for example, dramatic decreases were found in high- and medium-cover rangelands over the period 2000-2008. And recession of most glaciers was also observed in the study period. Instead, an increase of anthropogenic activities accelerated intensive alteration of land use, such as conversion of cropland to built-up land. We found that the change of vegetation cover was positively correlated with growing season precipitation (GSP). In addition, vegetation cover was substantially reduced along the pilgrimage routes particularly within 5 km of the routes. The findings of the study suggest that climatic warming and human disturbance are interacted to cause remarkable LUCC. Tourism development was responsible land use change in urban and pilgrimage routes. This study has important implications for landscape conservation and ecosystem management. The reduction of rangeland cover may decrease the rangeland quality and pose pressure for the carrying capacity of rangelands in the KSL-China. With the increasing risk of climate warming, rangeland conservation is imperative. The future development should shift from livestock-focus animal husbandry to service-based ecotourism in the sacred landscape.

TI  - Analysis of Retrackers' Performances and Water Level Retrieval over the Ebro River Basin Using Sentinel-3
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimeters have been used to monitor river and reservoir water levels, from which water storage estimates can be derived. Inland water altimetry can, therefore, play an important role in continental water resource management. Traditionally, satellite altimeters were designed to monitor homogeneous surfaces such as oceans or ice sheets, resulting in poor performance over small inland water bodies due to the contribution from land contamination in the returned waveforms. The advent of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimetry (with its improved along-track spatial resolution) has enabled the measurement of inland water levels with a better accuracy and an increased spatial resolution. This study aimed to retrieve water levels from Level-1B Sentinel-3 data with focus on the minimization of the land contamination over small- to middle-sized water bodies (130 m to 4.5 km), where continuous clean waveforms rarely exist. Three specialized algorithms or retrackers, together with a new waveform portion selection method, were evaluated to minimize land contamination in the waveforms and to select the nadir return associated with the water body being overflown. The waveform portion selection method, with consideration of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), was used to fit the multipeak waveforms that arise when overflying the continental water bodies, exploiting a subwaveform-based approach to pick up the one corresponding to the nadir. The performances of the proposed waveform portion selection method with three retrackers, namely, the threshold retracker, Offset Center of Gravity (OCOG) retracker and two-step SAR physical-based retracker, were compared. No significant difference was found in the results of the three retrackers. However, waveform portion selection using DEM information great improved the results. Time series of water levels were retrieved for water bodies in the Ebro River basin (Spain). The results show good agreement with in situ measurements from the Ebro Reservoir (approximately 1.8 km wide) and Ribarroja Reservoir (approximately 400 m wide), with unbiased root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) down to 0.28 m and 0.16 m, respectively, depending on the retracker.

TI  - Enhanced Back-Projection as Postprocessing for Pansharpening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is the process of integrating a high spatial resolution panchromatic image with a low spatial resolution multispectral image to obtain a multispectral image with high spatial and spectral resolution. Over the last decade, several algorithms have been developed for pansharpening. In this paper, a technique, called enhanced back-projection (EBP), is introduced and applied as postprocessing on the pansharpening. The proposed EBP first enhances the spatial details of the pansharpening results by histogram matching and high-pass modulation, followed by a back-projection process, which takes into account the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the satellite sensor such that the pansharpening results obey the consistency property. The EBP is validated on four datasets acquired by different satellites and several commonly used pansharpening methods. The pansharpening results achieve substantial improvements by this postprocessing technique, which is widely applicable and requires no modification of existing pansharpening methods.

TI  - Extraction of Urban Objects in Cloud Shadows on the basis of Fusion of Airborne LiDAR and Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature extraction in cloud shadows is a difficult problem in the field of optical remote sensing. The key to solving this problem is to improve the accuracy of classification algorithms by fusing multi-source remotely sensed data. Hyperspectral data have rich spectral information but highly suffer from cloud shadows, whereas light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data can be acquired from beneath clouds to provide accurate height information. In this study, fused airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data were used to extract urban objects in cloud shadows using the following steps: (1) a series of LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics were extracted and selected; (2) cloud shadows were extracted; (3) the new proposed approach was used by combining a pixel-based support vector machine (SVM) and object-based classifiers to extract urban objects in cloud shadows; (4) a pixel-based SVM classifier was used for the classification of the whole study area with the selected metrics; (5) a decision-fusion strategy was employed to get the final results for the whole study area; (6) accuracy assessment was conducted. Compared with the SVM classification results, the decision-fusion results of the combined SVM and object-based classifiers show that the overall classification accuracy is improved by 5.00% (from 87.30% to 92.30%). The experimental results confirm that the proposed method is very effective for urban object extraction in cloud shadows and thus improve urban applications such as urban green land management, land use analysis, and impervious surface assessment.

TI  - High cure rates and tolerability of artesunate-amodiaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Kibaha and Kigoma, Tanzania
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe Tanzanian National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) and its partners have been implementing regular therapeutic efficacy studies (TES) to monitor the performance of different drugs used or with potential use in Tanzania. However, most of the recent TES focused on artemether-lumefantrine, which is the first-line anti-malarial for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Data on the performance of other artemisinin-based combinations is urgently needed to support timely review and changes of treatment guidelines in case of drug resistance to the current regimen. This study was conducted at two NMCP sentinel sites (Kibaha, Pwani and Ujiji, Kigoma) to assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), which are the current alternative artemisinin-based combinations in Tanzania.MethodsThis was a single-arm prospective evaluation of the clinical and parasitological responses of ASAQ and DP for directly observed treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Children aged 6months to 10years and meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled and treated with either ASAQ or DP. In each site, patients were enrolled sequentially; thus, enrolment of patients for the assessment of one artemisinin-based combination was completed before patients were recruited for assessment of the second drugs. Follow-up was done for 28 or 42days for ASAQ and DP, respectively. The primary outcome was PCR corrected cure rates while the secondary outcome was occurrence of adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs).ResultsOf the 724 patients screened at both sites, 333 (46.0%) were enrolled and 326 (97.9%) either completed the 28/42days of follow-up, or attained any of the treatment outcomes. PCR uncorrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) for DP on day 42 was 98.8% and 75.9% at Kibaha and Ujiji, respectively. After PCR correction, DP's ACPR was 100% at both sites. For ASAQ, no parasite recurrence occurred giving 100% ACPR on day 28. Only one patient in the DP arm (1.1%) from Ujiji had parasites on day 3. Of the patients recruited (n=333), 175 (52.6%) had AEs with 223 episodes (at both sites) in the two treatment groups. There was no SAE and the commonly reported AE episodes (with>5%) included, cough, running nose, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and fever.ConclusionBoth artemisinin-based combinations had high cure rates with PCR corrected ACPR of 100%. The two drugs had adequate safety with no SAE and all AEs were mild, and not associated with the anti-malarials. Continued TES is critical to monitor the performance of nationally recommended artemisinin-based combination therapy and supporting evidence-based review of malaria treatment policies.Trial registration This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, No. NCT03431714

TI  - Automatic Grassland Cutting Status Detection in the Context of Spatiotemporal Sentinel-1 Imagery Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland contributes to carbon storage and animal feed production. Its yield is largely determined by the cutting times of grassland. Previous studies have used remote sensing data for grassland biomass estimation, but only a few studies have focused on SAR remote sensing approaches for automatic grassland cutting status detection. Due to the occurrence of multiple cuttings in a year, it is crucial to effectively monitor grassland cutting events in order to achieve accurate biomass estimations of a whole season. In this study, we examined the capabilities of multilayer perceptron neural networks for automatic grassland cutting status detection using SAR imagery. The proposed model inputs are a time series dataset of VV and VH Sentinel-1 C-band SAR and second-order texture metrics (homogeneity, entropy, contrast and dissimilarity). The proposed approach has been successfully tested on a dataset collected from several fields in Germany in 2016, with an overall accuracy of 85.71% for the validation set.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns and effects of climate and land use on surface water extent dynamics in a dryland region with three decades of Landsat satellite data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal distribution and systematic quantification of surface water and their drivers of change are critical. However, quantifying this distribution is challenging due to a lack of spatially explicit and temporally dynamic empirical data of both surface water and is drivers of change at large spatial scales. We focused on one of the largest dryland basins in the world, Australia's Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), recently identified as a global hotspot. of water decline. We used a new remotely sensed time-series of surface water extent dynamics (SWD) data to quantify spatiotemporal patterns in surface water across the entire MDB and catchments and to assess natural and anthropogenic drivers of SWD including climate and historical land use change. We show high intra- and inter-annual dynamics in surface water with a rapid loss during the Millennium Drought, the worst, decade-long drought in SE Australia. We show strong regional and catchment differences in SWD with the northern basin showing high variability compared to the southern basin which shows a steady decline in surface water. Linear mixed effect models including climate and land-use change variables explained up to 70% variability in SWD with climate being more important in catchments of the northwestern MDB, whereas land-use was important primarily in the central MDB. Increase in fraction of dryland agriculture in a catchment and maximum temperature was negatively related to SWD, whereas precipitation and soil moisture were positively related to SWD. The tact that land-use change was an important explanatory variable of SWD in addition to climate is a significant result as land-use can be managed more effectively whereas climate-mitigation actions can be intractable, with global change scenarios predicting drier conditions for the area followed by a further reduction in surface water availability.

TI  - Monitoring and Analysis on Vegetation and Waters Dynamics in Chinese Priority Areas for Biodiversity Conservation During 2001-2016
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity is necessary for ecological sustainable development. Priority areas for biodiversity conservation are the key areas for biodiversity conservation in China. It is of great significance to monitor the dynamic changes on vegetation and water which are important natural habitats. In the present study, the MODIS reflectance data and GLASS products (2001-2016) were used as the main data source, and fractional vegetation coverage ( FVC) and water area which are closely related to the maintenance of biodiversity, were selected as the monitoring indicators. The present situation and changing trends on the natural habitat status for 32 priority areas for terrestrial biodiversity conservation in China were analyzed in depth based on remote sensing. The results show that FVC in priority areas is better than national average. The varying trend on FVC in the priority areas were generally improved from 2001 to 2016, of which 53. 98% was increased while 24. 41% was decreased. In the past five years the FVC in Qiang tang-Sanjiangyuan area, Hulunbeir District and Dongting Lake region has shown a decreasing trend. In addition, water area was increased generally, which was more evident in the three priority areas, Qiangtang-Sanjiangyuan area, Songnen Plain area and West Ordos-Helan Mountains-Yin Mountains area.

TI  - Study on Evaluation and Driving Forces of Ecological Changes in Jinghe County, Xinjiang
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the Landsat remote sensing images from 1994, 2002, and 2016, the ecological environment quality of Jinghe County was studied by using the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) to analyze Comprehensive Green, Humidity, Dryness and Heat Index and Principal Components. The results show that the RSEI index based on greenness, humidity, heat and dryness has certain applicability, and can better monitor and evaluate the ecological environment quality and its temporal and spatial changes in Jinghe County. In 1994, 2002, and 2016, the average RSEI index was 0. 377, 0. 323 and 0. 327, respectively, and after ranking the RSEI index, it was found that the "poor" quality of the ecological environment was dominant, the grade of " excellent" was reduced , the ecological environment in the area was developing to the bad direction. The artificial oasis in Jinghe County expanded remarkably, and the area of natural oasis decreased. Climate change and human activities have had combined effects on the ecological environment of Jinghe County. The deterioration of ecological environment quality is greatly affected by human disturbance. Population pressure, urbanization process, unreasonable grazing, rational allocation of land resources, inefficient utilization of water resources and other human factors are still the critical points to concern for future ecological environment construction in Jinghe County.

TI  - Improved population mapping for China using remotely sensed and points-of-interest data within a random forests model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image products (e.g. brightness of nighttime lights and land cover/land use types) have been widely used to disaggregate census data to produce griciclecl population maps for large geographic areas. The advent of the geospatial big data revolution has created additional opportunities to map population distributions at fine resolutions with high accuracy. A considerable proportion of the geospatial data contains semantic information that indicates different categories of human activities occurring at exact geographic locations. Such information is often lacking in remote sensing data. In addition, the remarkable progress in machine learning provides toolkits for demographers to model complex nonlinear correlations between population and heterogeneous geographic covariates. In this study, a typical type of geospatial big data, points-of-interest (POls), was combined with multi source remote sensing data in a random forests model to disaggregate the 2010 county-level census population data to 100 x 100 m grids. Compared with the WorldPop population dataset, our population map showed higher accuracy. The root mean square error for population estimates in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing for this method and WorldPop were 27,829 and 34,193, respectively. The large under-allocation of the population in urban areas and over-allocation in rural areas in the WorldPop dataset was greatly reduced in this new population map. Apart from revealing the effectiveness of POls in improving population mapping, this study promises the potential of geospatial big data for mapping other socioeconomic parameters in the future.

TI  - Response of Vegetation Coverage to Climate Change in Altai Mountain Forest and Grassland Ecological Function Area in Xinjiang, China
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Xinjiang Altai Mountain Forest and Prairie Ecological Functional Area ( referred as Altai Ecological Function Area hereafter) is one of the eight key water conservation ecological function areas defined by the Major Function Oriented Zoning of China. Understanding the responses of vegetation growth to climate change in the area is extremely important due to the strong sensitivity and vulnerability of the vegetation ecosystem in the area. Weather ( temperature and precipitation) and vegetation ( coverage and type) data (1986-2015) that derived from 7 meteorological stations across the Altai Ecological Function Area and the remote sensing data were used in this study for identifying the response relationship of vegetation coverage to climate change in the area. The results show that : (1) During the period of 1986-2015, changes in mean annual temperature ( MAT) in the area represented as a significant upward trend, with a tendency rate of 0. 34 degrees C . (10 a)(-1) , while the mean annual precipitation ( MAP) showed a cycle fluctuation increasing trend, with a tendency rate of 6. 19 mm . ( 10 a)(-1) ; The mean annual normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI) showed a slow overall downward trend, with a small tendency rate of -0. 001 ( 10 a)(-1) ; Meanwhile, the NDVI showed a significant upward trend during the growing season , with a tendency rate of 0. 002 ( 10 a)(-1). ( 2) Vegetation coverage in the area remained stable over the period of 1986-2015. The areas with rate of NDVI change -0. 001 ( 10 a)(-1) to 0. 001 ( 10 a)(-1) covered approximately 60. 4% of the study area; The areas with significantly-declined vegetation coverage [rate of NDVI change < - 0. 002 (10 a)(-1)] covered approximately 3. 1% of the area, and were mainly distributed in the northwestern parts of Altai Mountains; The areas with significantly-increased vegetation coverage [rate of NDVI change>0. 002 ( 10 a)(-1)] covered 2. 1% , and were mainly distributed in the southeast and central regions of the study area. ( 3) Across the Altai Ecological Function Area, the responses of vegetation coverage to changes in precipitation are more sensitive than to temperature, however, the responses of changes in NDVI to changes in temperature and precipitation have a lagging effect that differed significantly for different time periods.

TI  - Estimation of spatiotemporal PM<sub>1.0</sub> distributions in China by combining PM<sub>2.5</sub> observations with satellite aerosol optical depth
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulates smaller than 1.0 mu m (PM1.0) have strong associations with public health and environment, and considerable exposure data should be obtained to understand the actual environmental burden. This study presented a PM1.0 estimation strategy based on the generalised regression neural network model. The proposed strategy combined ground-based observations of PM2.5 and satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) to estimate PM1.0 concentrations in China from July 2015 to June 2017. Results indicated that the PM1.0 estimates agreed well with the ground-based measurements with an R-2 of 0.74, root mean square error of 19.0 mu g/m(3) and mean absolute error of 11.4 mu g/m(3) as calculated with the tenfold cross-validation method. The diurnal estimation performance displayed remarkable single-peak variation with the highest. R-2 of 0.80 at noon, and the seasonal estimation performance showed that the proposed method could effectively capture high-pollution events of PM1.0 in winter. Spatially, the most polluted areas were clustered in the North China Plain, where the average estimates presented a bimodal distribution during daytime. In addition, the quality of satellite-derived AOD, the robustness of the interpolation algorithm and the proportion of PM1.0 in PM2.5 were confirmed to affect the estimation accuracy of the proposed model.

TI  - An assessment of the performance of two snow kernels in characterizing snow scattering properties
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The kernel-driven RossThick-LiSparseReciprocal (RTLSR) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model has been widely used in the quantitative remote sensing community. However, the performance of this model is challenged when modelling the optical scattering properties of pure snow surfaces. Recently, two snow kernels have been developed to improve the snow anisotropic reflectance in the kernel-driven RTLSR model framework. However, the performances of these two snow kernels must be assessed to identify their potential applications. Therefore, we assess the performances of these two kernels using various BRDF data sources. Our findings demonstrate their differences in several aspects. (1) These two kernels differ in characterizing the variability in BRDF shape as a function of the solar zenith angle (SZA). As the SZA increases, the shape of snow kernel derived by the asymptotic radiative transfer (ART) model (hereinafter named the ART method) changes from a dome shape to bowl shape, which agrees well with the simulation data of the bicontinuous photon tracking (bic-PT) model. The shape of the snow kernel proposed by Qu et al. (hereinafter named the Qu method) based on the Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (RPV) model maintains a bowl shape for all SZAs. These differences in the kernel performances affect their abilities to fit snow BRDF data with different SZAs. (2) The corrected RTLSR models, with their respective snow kernels, are generally able to model the forward-scattering properties of snow surfaces compared with the original RTLSR model. However, the ART method performs better in capturing the BRDF variations in snow surfaces than the Qu method. This assessment provides an improved understanding of the performance of these two snow kernels and, thus, suggests further applications for the ART snow kernel in the kernel-driven BRDF model framework in the near future.

TI  - Radiometric Cross-Calibration of GF-1 PMS Sensor with a New BRDF Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On-orbit radiometric calibration of a space-borne sensor is of great importance for quantitative remote sensing applications. Cross-calibration is a common method with high calibration accuracy, and the core and emphasis of this method is to select the appropriate reference satellite sensor. As for the cross-calibration of high-spatial resolution and narrow-swath sensor, however, there are some scientific issues, such as large observation angles of reference image, and non-synchronization (or quasi-synchronization) between the imaging date of reference image and the date of sensor to be calibrated, which affects the accuracy of cross-calibration to a certain degree. Therefore, taking the GaoFen-1 (GF-1) Panchromatic and Multi-Spectral (PMS) sensor as an example in this research, an innovative radiometric cross-calibration method is proposed to overcome this bottleneck. Firstly, according a set of criteria, valid MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imagine Spectroradiometer) images of sunny day in one year over the Dunhuang radiometric calibration site in China are extracted, and a new and distinctive bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model based on top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and imaging angles of the sunny day MODIS images is constructed. Subsequently, the cross-calibration of PMS sensor at Dunhuang and Golmud radiation calibration test sites is carried out by using the method presented in this paper, taking the MODIS image with large solar and observation angles and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) with different dates from PMS as reference. The validation results of the calibration coefficients indicate that our proposed method can acquire high calibration accuracy, and the total calibration uncertainties of PMS using MODIS as reference sensor are less than 6%.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We analysed the ground deformation across two blocks defined by the Rio-Patras fault from 1993 to 2017 using multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) techniques. Our main objective was to contribute to the assessment of seismic hazard near the large city of Patras. Multiple data-sets were used, each one covering different temporal periods. Descending and ascending acquisitions, providing different viewing geometries contribute to fully determine the ground displacement in 3D. The data-sets used are from the European Space Agency's (ESA) European Remote Sensing (ERS), Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) and SENTINEL-1 as well as German Aerospace Center (DLR) 's TERRASAR-X missions. Considering ESA's missions covering both acquisition geometries and long periods, the southern block, showing lack of a sufficient number of scatterers does not allow the displacement characterization. In contrary, the northern block is characterized by a high number of scatterers having values of maximum likehood ranging from -3.5 to -4.3 mm year(-1) for ascending geometry and from -1.6 to -2.7 mm year(-1) for the descending one. The fact that both geometries show negative values of displacements are consistent with downlift movement and at the same time the quantitative differentiation probably indicates an horizontal component as well.

TI  - Repeat Glacier Collapses and Surges in the Amney Machen Mountain Range, Tibet, Possibly Triggered by a Developing Rock-Slope Instability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Collapsing valley glaciers leaving their bed to rush down a flat hill slope at the speed of a racing car are so far rare events. They have only been reported for the Kolkaglacier (Caucasus) in 2002 and the two glaciers in the Aru mountain range (Tibet) that failed in 2016. Both events have been studied in detail using satellite data and modeling to learn more about the reasons for and processes related to such events. This study reports about a series of so far undocumented glacier collapses that occurred in the Amney Machen mountain range (eastern Tibet) in 2004, 2007, and 2016. All three collapses were associated with a glacier surge, but from 1987 to 1995, the glacier surged without collapsing. The later surges and collapses were likely triggered by a progressing slope instability that released large amounts of ice and rock to the lower glacier tongue, distorting its dynamic stability. The surges and collapses might continue in the future as more ice and rock is available to fall on the glacier. It has been speculated that the development is a direct response to regional temperature increase that destabilized the surrounding hanging glaciers. However, the specific properties of the steep rock slopes and the glacier bed might also have played a role.

TI  - Multiscale Analysis of DInSAR Measurements for Multi-Source Investigation at Uturuncu Volcano (Bolivia)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Uturuncu volcano (southwestern Bolivia) is localized within one of the largest updoming volcanic zones, the Altiplano Puna Volcanic Complex (APVC). In several geodetic studies the observed uplift phenomenon is analyzed and modeled by considering a deep source, related to the Altiplano Puna Magma Body (APMB). In this framework, we perform a multiscale analysis on the 2003-2010 ENVISAT satellite data to investigate the existence of a multi-source scenario for this region. The proposed analysis is based on Cross-correlation and Multiridge method, pointing out the spatial and temporal multiscale properties of the deformation field. In particular, we analyze the vertical component of ground deformation during two time interval: within the 2005-2008 time interval an inflating source at 18.7 km depth beneath the central zone of the APVC is retrieved; this result is in good agreement with those proposed by several authors for the APMB. Between August 2006 and February 2007, we identify a further inflating source at 4.5 km depth, beneath Uturuncu volcano; the existence of this latter, located just below the 2009-2010 seismic swarm, is supported by petrological, geochemical, and geophysical evidence, indicating as a possible interpretative scenario the action of shallow, temporarily trapped fluids.

TI  - Upscaling Evapotranspiration with Parsimonious Models in a North Carolina Vineyard
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Water stress can positively or negatively impact grape yield and yield quality, and there is a need for wine growers to accurately regulate water use. In a four-year study (2010-2013), energy balance fluxes were measured with an eddy-covariance (EC) system in a North Carolina vineyard (Vitis vinifera cv. Chardonnay), and evapotranspiration (ET) and the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) calculated. A multiple linear regression model was developed to upscale ET using air temperature (Ta), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and Landsat-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Daily ET reached values of up to 7.7 mm day(-1), and the annual ET was 752 +/- 59 mm, as measured with the EC system. The grapevine CWSI was between 0.53-0.85, which indicated moderate water stress levels. Median vineyard EVI was between 0.22 and 0.72, and the EVI range (max-min) within the vineyard was 0.18. The empirical models explained 75%-84% of the variation in ET, and all parameters had a positive linear relationship to ET. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 0.52-0.62 mm. This study presents easily applicable approaches to analyzing water dynamics and ET. This may help wine growers to cost-effectively quantify water use in vineyards.

T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Understanding the behavior of Earth through the diverse fields of the solid Earth geosciences is an increasingly important task. It is made challenging by the complex, interacting, and multiscale processes needed to understand Earth's behavior and by the inaccessibility of nearly all of Earth's subsurface to direct observation. Substantial increases in data availability and in the increasingly realistic character of computer simulations hold promise for accelerating progress, but developing a deeper understanding based on these capabilities is itself challenging. Machine learning will play a key role in this effort. We review the state of the field and make recommendations for how progress might be broadened and accelerated.

TI  - Energy balance quantification using Landsat 8 images and SAFER algorithm in Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are different algorithms to estimate the energy balance equation. This equation expresses net radiation converting to other forms of radiation fluxes. Thus, the equation consists of net radiation (R-n), sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (lambda E), and soil heat flux (G). The computation of the equation is helpful to consider energy exchange between the atmosphere and the surface. Therefore, testing different methods could help us in finding a more accurate way to estimate the energy balance equation. The simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving (SAFER) algorithm is a method to estimate energy balance equation parameters. Mashhad area in northeast of Iran located in a semiarid region was chosen as the study area. R-n, H, lambda E, and G were calculated by the SAFER algorithm (method 1). In addition, R-n, H, lambda E, and G were computed based on a theoretical formula (method 2). Surface albedo (a(0)) and surface temperature (T-0) were the two input parameters used in both methods. In method 1, a(0) and T-0 values are spatially distributed in Mashhad while they are constant values in method 2. The results of method 1 and method 2 were compared. The obtained results showed +/- 2 Mj m(-2) d(-1) differences for R-n, H, and lambda Evariables in both methods. Albedo and surface temperature values that were spatially distributed in method 1 lead to a wide variation range in the calculated energy terms. However, these parameters, which were considered as constant values, made energy terms have limited variation range in method 2. Therefore, the differences in the obtained results between the two methods resulted from a(0) and T-0 values. The differences in the values were insignificant in the large-scale calculation, which can be ignored. The SAFER algorithm showed acceptable results in the semiarid of Mashhad region. This algorithm can be used for energy balance equation estimation in Mashhad. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Model simulation of ammonium and nitrate aerosols distribution in the Euro-Mediterranean region and their radiative and climatic effects over 1979-2016
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols play an important role in Europe and the Mediterranean area where different sources of natural and anthropogenic particles are present. Among them ammonium and nitrate (A&N) aerosols may have a growing impact on regional climate. In this study, their representation in coarse and fine modes has been introduced in the prognostic aerosol scheme of the ALADIN-Climate regional model. This new aerosol scheme is evaluated over Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, using two twin simulations over the period 1979-2016 with and without A&N aerosols. This evaluation is performed at local and regional scales, using surface stations and satellite measurements. Despite an overestimate of the surface nitrate concentration, the model is able to reproduce its spatial pattern including local maxima (Benelux, Po Valley). Concerning the simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD), the inclusion of A&N aerosols significantly reduces the model bias compared to both AERONET stations and satellite data. Our results indicate that A&N aerosols can contribute up to 40% of the total AOD(550) over Europe, with an average of 0.07 (550 nm) over the period 2001-2016. Sensitivity studies suggest that biases still present are related to uncertainties associated with the annual cycle of A&N aerosol precursors (ammonia and nitric acid). The decrease in sulfate aerosol production over Europe since 1980 produces more free ammonia in the atmosphere leading to an increase in A&N concentrations over the studied period. Analyses of the different aerosol trends have shown for the first time to our knowledge that, since 2005 over Europe, A&N AOD550 and A&N shortwave (SW) direct radiative forcing (DRF) are found to be higher than sulfate and organics, making these the species with the highest AOD and the highest DRF. On average over the period 1979-2016, the A&N DRF is found to be about -1.7 Wm(-2) at the surface and -1.4 Wm(-2) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) in all sky conditions over Europe, with regional maxima located at the surface over the Po Valley (-5 Wm(-2)). Finally, the dimming effect of A&N aerosols is responsible for a cooling of about -0.2 degrees C over Europe (summer), with a maximum of -04 degrees C over the Po Valley. Concerning precipitation, no significant impact of A&N aerosols has been found.

Extending from the initial LIVVkit software framework, we demonstrate Greenland ice sheet simulation validation metrics using the coupled Community Earth System Model (CESM) as well as an idealized stand-alone high-resolution Community Ice Sheet Model, version 2 (CISM2), coupled to the Albany/FELIX velocity solver (CISM-Albany or CISM-A). As one example of the capability, LIVVkit analyzes the degree to which models capture the surface mass balance (SMB) and identifies potential sources of bias, using recently available in situ and remotely sensed data as comparison. Related fields within atmosphere and land surface models, e.g., surface temperature, radiation, and cloud cover, are also diagnosed. Applied to the CESM1.0, LIVVkit identifies a positive SMB bias that is focused largely around Greenland's southwest region that is due to insufficient ablation.

TI  - Bayesian mixture models and their Big Data implementations with application to invasive species presence-only data
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIG DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to their conceptual simplicity and flexibility, non-parametric mixture models are widely used to identify latent clusters in data. However, when it comes to Big Data, such as Landsat imagery, such model fitting is computationally prohibitive. To overcome this issue, we fit Bayesian non-parametric models to pre-smoothed data, thereby reducing the computational time from days to minutes, while disregarding little of the useful information. Tree based clustering is used to partition the clusters into smaller and smaller clusters in order to identify clusters of high, medium and low interest. The tree-based clustering method is applied to Landsat images from the Brisbane region, which were the actual sources of motivation for development of the method. The images are taken as a part of the red imported fire-ant eradication program that was launched in September 2001 and which is funded by all Australian states and territories, along with the federal government. To satisfy budgetary constraints, modelling is performed to estimate the risk of fire-ant incursion in each cluster so that the eradication program focuses on high risk clusters. The likelihood of containment is successfully derived by combining the fieldwork survey data with the results obtained from the proposed method.

TI  - The effectiveness of influenza vaccination in preventing hospitalizations in elderly in Beijing, 2016-18
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Influenza vaccinations play an important role in preventing influenza related hospitalizations. The objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination in protecting Beijing residents aged >= 60 years from influenza related hospitalizations during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 influenza seasons.Methods: Patients who met the definition of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and were hospitalized in the nine sentinel hospitals in Beijing during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 influenza seasons were identified as the study population. The vaccination status of patients was obtained from a vaccination registry. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments were conducted to test pharyngeal or lower respiratory tract samples collected from SARI patients for influenza A and B viruses. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was examined using a test-negative design that compare the odds of vaccination among influenza positives and negatives, adjusting for calendar week of illness onset, age, and underlying medical conditions.Results: We identified 50,364 patients in the study, in which there were 145 influenza cases and 528 influenza-negative controls aged >= 60 years in 2016/17 season and 149 cases and 358 controls aged >= 60 years in 2017/18 season. The most commonly identified subtype among participants was influenza A(H3N2) in 2016/17 and 2017/18 season (78.5% and 70.6%). Among the adults aged >= 60 years, the adjusted VE of vaccination against any influenza virus for serious acute respiratory infection (SARI) patients was 32.8% (95% confidence interval ICI]: -22.0 to 63.0%) in 2016/17 season. While the adjusted VE in 2017/18 season were 4.6% (95% CI: -72.4 to 47.2%) against any types of influenza, 29.2% (95% CI: -92.9 to 74%) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, -37.7% (95% Cl: -293.8; 51.9%) against influenza A (H3N2) viruses, and 3.6% (95% CI: -113.8 to 56.5%) against influenza B.Conclusion: The influenza vaccine provided moderate protection in 2016/17 season and mild protection in 2017/18 season for influenza related inpatients of adults aged >= 60 years in Beijing.

TI  - Evaluation of radiometric performance of MODIS visible bands using the Rayleigh scattering method
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has provided a large number of high-quality remote sensing data for Earth observation since its launch. Although the reflectance data is calibrated by on-board calibrators, it also needs to be verified by other independent methods in order to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. Thus, the Rayleigh scattering method is used to evaluate the MODIS/Aqua reflectance data in our study. In order to obtain high-precision Rayleigh scattering calculation results, the atmospheric and oceanic parameters (AOPs) corresponding to the local time and place, such as wind speed, aerosol optical depth, ozone amount, chlorophyll concentration, and seawater salinity, are put into a radiative transfer model to calculate after a series of screening. The current research selects the pixels with strong Rayleigh scattering characteristics in four days from a global ocean scene. The simulated reflectance is compared with the MYD021K1VI reflectance product in five visible bands, which presents the total uncertainties as, respectively, 1.39% (412 nm), 0.14% (469 nm), -0.18% (488 nm), -0.47% (531 nm), -0.41% (551 nm). The verification results prove that the MODIS reflectance product remains at a high level of precision without significant deviation after having operated in orbit for 16 years, and the MODIS product has high interband selfconsistency. The sensitivity analysis shows that the wind speed and chlorophyll concentration perturbed more to the simulated reflectance than other AOPs of the selected samples. It is believed that the methodology can be applicable to other visible light sensors for validating their reflectance product accurately.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria and prevalence of <i>Pfk13</i> and <i>Pfmdr1</i> polymorphisms after a decade of using artemisinin-based combination therapy in mainland Tanzania
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The World Health Organization recommends regular therapeutic efficacy studies (TES) to monitor the performance of first and second-line anti-malarials. In 2016, efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria were assessed through a TES conducted between April and October 2016 at four sentinel sites of Kibaha, Mkuzi, Mlimba, and Ujiji in Tanzania. The study also assessed molecular markers of artemisinin and lumefantrine (partner drug) resistance.Methods: Eligible patients were enrolled at the four sites, treated with standard doses of AL, and monitored for 28 days with clinical and laboratory assessments. The main outcomes were PCR corrected cure rates, day 3 positivity rates, safety of AL, and prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 (Pfk13) (codon positions: 440-600) and P. falciparum multi-drug resistance 1 (Pfmdr1) genes (codons: N86Y, Y184F and D1246Y), markers of artemisinin and lumefantrine resistance, respectively.Results: Of 344 patients enrolled, three withdrew, six were lost to follow-up; and results were analysed for 335 (97.4%) patients. Two patients had treatment failure (one early treatment failure and one recrudescent infection) after PCR correction, yielding an adequate clinical and parasitological response of > 98%. Day 3 positivity rates ranged from 0 to 5.7%. Common adverse events included cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Two patients had serious adverse events; one died after the first dose of AL and another required hospitalization after the second dose of AL (on day 0) but recovered completely. Of 344 samples collected at enrolment (day 0), 92.7% and 100% were successfully sequenced for Pfk13 and Pfmdr1 genes, respectively. Six (1.9%) had non-synonymous mutations in Pfk13, none of which had been previously associated with artemisinin resistance. For Pfmdr1, the NFD haplotype (codons N86, 184F and D1246) was detected in 134 (39.0%) samples; ranging from 33.0% in Mlimba to 45.5% at Mkuzi. The difference among the four sites was not significant (p = 0.578). All samples had a single copy of the Pfmdr1 gene.Conclusion: The study indicated high efficacy of AL and the safety profile was consistent with previous reports. There were no known artemisinin-resistance Pfk13 mutations, but there was a high prevalence of a Pfmdr1 haplotype associated with reduced sensitivity to lumefantrine (but no reduced efficacy was observed in the subjects). Continued TES and monitoring of markers of resistance to artemisinin and partner drugs is critical for early detection of resistant parasites and to inform evidence-based malaria treatment policies.

TI  - Glacier and glacial lake classification for change detection studies using satellite data: a case study from Baspa basin, western Himalaya
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Using high-resolution Google Earth(TM) images in conjunction with Landsat images, the glaciers and lakes in the Baspa basin are classified to explore the recent changes. A total number of 109 glaciers (187 +/- 3.7 km(2)) are mapped and subsequently classified as compound valley glaciers, simple valley glaciers, cirques, niches, glacieretes and ice aprons. The compound and simple valley glaciers contribute 67.1 +/- 1.3% and 19.8 +/- 0.3% to the total glacier cover of the basin. Similarly, a total number of 129 glacial lakes (0.360 +/- 0.007 km(2)) are identified. From 1976 to 2011, the compound valley glaciers have lost a small area of 10.3 +/- 0.03% at a rate of 0.41 +/- 0.002 km(2) a(-1), whereas the niche glaciers have lost higher area of 40.1 +/- 0.001% at a rate of 0.04 +/- 0.0001 km(2) a(-1). Change detection of two benchmark glacial lakes revealed a progressive expansion during recent decades. The Baspa Bamak proglacial lake has expanded from 0.020 +/- 0.0004 km(2) (2000) to 0.069 +/- 0.001 km(2) (2011). Due to the complete loss of source ice, another glacial lake has expanded from 0.09 +/- 0.001 km(2) (1994) to 0.10 +/- 0.002 km(2) (2011). During the study period, the mean annual temperature that is T-avg, T-min and T-max have increased significantly at the 95% confidence level by 1.5 C-o (0.070 degrees C a(-1)), 1.8 C-o (0.076 degrees C a(-1)) and 1.6 C-o (0.0071 degrees C a(-1)) from 1985 to 2008. However, the precipitation has decreased significantly from 1976 and 1985 to 2008.

TI  - Discrimination and classification of mangrove forests using EO-1 Hyperion data: a case study of Indian Sundarbans
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing the identification accuracy of mangroves is greatly influenced by terrestrial vegetation. This paper deals with the use of specific vegetation indices for extracting mangrove forests using Earth Observing-1 Hyperion image over a portion of Indian Sundarbans, followed by classification of mangroves into floristic composition classes. Five vegetation indices (three new and two published), namely Mangrove Probability Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Wetland Vegetation Index, Shortwave Infrared Absorption Index, Normalized Difference Infrared Index and Atmospherically Corrected Vegetation Index were used in decision tree algorithm to develop the mangrove mask. Then, three full-pixel classifiers, namely Minimum Distance, Spectral Angle Mapper and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were evaluated on the data within the mask. SVM performed better than the other two classifiers with an overall precision of 99.08%. The methodology presented here may be applied in different mangrove areas for producing community zonation maps at finer levels.

TI  - Historical and recent aufeis in the Indigirka River basin (Russia)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Review
AB  - A detailed spatial geodatabase of aufeis (or naled in Russian) within the Indigirka River watershed (305 000 km(2)), Russia, was compiled from historical Russian publications (year 1958), topographic maps (years 1970-1980s) and Landsat images (year 2013-2017). Identification of aufeis by late spring Landsat images was performed with a semi-automated approach according to Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and additional data. After this, a cross-reference index was set for each aufeis field to link and compare historical and satellite-based aufeis datasets.The aufeis coverage varies from 0.26% to 1.15% in different sub-basins within the Indigirka River watershed. The digitized historical archive (Cadastre, 1958) contains the coordinates and characteristics of 896 aufeis fields with a total area of 2064 km(2). The Landsat-based dataset included 1213 aufeis fields with a total area of 1287 km(2). Accordingly, the satellite-derived total aufeis area is 1.6 times less than the Cadastre (1958) dataset. However, more than 600 aufeis fields identified from Landsat images are missing in the Cadastre (1958) archive. It is therefore possible that the conditions for aufeis formation may have changed from the mid-20th century to the present.Most present and historical aufeis fields are located in the elevation band of 1000-1200 m. About 60% of the total aufeis area is represented by just 10% of the largest aufeis fields. Interannual variability of aufeis area for the period of 2001-2016 was assessed for the Bolshaya Momskaya aufeis and for a group of large aufeis fields (11 aufeis fields with areas from 5 to 70 km(2)) in the basin of the Syuryuktyakh River. The results of this analysis indicate a tendency towards an area decrease in the Bolshaya Momskaya aufeis in recent years, while no reduction in Syuryuktyakh River aufeis area was observed.

TI  - Modelling and Predicting the Growing Stock Volume in Small-Scale Plantation Forests of Tanzania Using Multi-Sensor Image Synergy
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed assisted forest inventory has emerged in the past decade as a robust and cost efficient method for generating accurate information on forest biophysical parameters. The launching and public access of ALOS PALSAR-2, Sentinel-1 (SAR), and Sentinel-2 together with the associated open-source software, has further increased the opportunity for application of remotely sensed data in forest inventories. In this study, we evaluated the ability of ALOS PALSAR-2, Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 and their combinations to predict growing stock volume in small-scale forest plantations of Tanzania. The effects of two variable extraction approaches (i.e., centroid and weighted mean), seasonality (i.e., rainy and dry), and tree species on the prediction accuracy of growing stock volume when using each of the three remotely sensed data were also investigated. Statistical models relating growing stock volume and remotely sensed predictor variables at the plot-level were fitted using multiple linear regression. The models were evaluated using the k-fold cross validation and judged based on the relative root mean square error values (RMSEr). The results showed that: Sentinel-2 (RMSEr = 42.03% and pseudo - R-2 = 0.63) and the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (RMSEr = 46.98% and pseudo - R-2 = 0.52), had better performance in predicting growing stock volume, as compared to Sentinel-1 (RMSEr = 59.48% and pseudo - R-2 = 0.18) alone. Models fitted with variables extracted from the weighted mean approach, turned out to have relatively lower RMSEr % values, as compared to centroid approaches. Sentinel-2 rainy season based models had slightly smaller RMSEr values, as compared to dry season based models. Dense time series (i.e., annual) data resulted to the models with relatively lower RMSEr values, as compared to seasonal based models when using variables extracted from the weighted mean approach. For the centroid approach there was no notable difference between the models fitted using dense time series versus rain season based predictor variables. Stratifications based on tree species resulted into lower RMSEr values for Pinus patula tree species, as compared to other tree species. Finally, our study concluded that combination of Sentinel-1&2 as well as the use Sentinel-2 alone can be considered for remote-sensing assisted forest inventory in the small-scale plantation forests of Tanzania. Further studies on the effect of field plot size, stratification and statistical methods on the prediction accuracy are recommended.

TI  - Towards automated 10-30 m resolution land cover mapping in insular South-East Asia
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we create and critically analyse an automated decision tree classification approach for regional level land cover mapping in insular South-East Asian conditions, using a combination of 10-30 m resolution optical and radar data. The resulting map contains 11 land cover classes and reveals a great deal of contextual information due to high spatial resolution. A limited accuracy assessment indicates 59-97% class wise accuracies. The unprecedented spatial detail of closed canopy oil palm mapping (with user's accuracy of 90%) is seen as the most promising feature of the mapping approach. The incapability of separating primary forests from other tree cover, and the large variety of different landscapes (e.g. home gardens and tea plantations) classified as shrubland, are considered the main areas for future improvement. Overall, the study demonstrates the great potential of multi-source 10-30 m resolution high data volume land cover mapping approaches in insular South-East Asian conditions.

TI  - A computationally efficient multi-domain active learning method for crop mapping using satellite image time-series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop mapping through classification of Satellite Image Time-Series (SITS) data can provide precious information for several agricultural applications, such as crop monitoring, yield forecasting, and crop inventory. However, several issues affect the classification performance of SITS data. As one of the most challenging problems, constituent images of time-series provide different levels of information about crops. These differences are the result of dynamic spectral responses of crops and also the variable atmospheric and sensor conditions. The second issue is the unavailability of adequate high-quality samples for training the classifier. In this study, we proposed a novel computationally efficient Multi-Domain Active Learning (MDAL) method which takes advantage of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) and Active Learning (AL) algorithms to address these two issues. The proposed method uses MKL algorithms to address the issues associated with different information level of the data, which generally cannot be modelled using the well-known classification algorithms. AL algorithms were also used for semi-automatic selection of training samples. However, most of the MKL algorithms are very computationally demanding. Consequently, using them in the MDAL method can dramatically increase the computational costs. Thus, in this paper, we presented the similarity-based MKL algorithms. Thanks to their low computational complexities, these algorithms are the most suitable MKL algorithms that can be used in the MDAL method. We evaluated the proposed method using two multispectral SITS datasets, acquired by RapidEye and SPOT sensors. The obtained results of the MDAL method for these datasets respectively showed 8.2% and 5.87% increase in the overall accuracy of classification as compared to the accuracy of the standard AL algorithm. The results also showed that in the case of adopting the SimpleMKL algorithm (a common MKL algorithm in the literature) the computational time of the MDAL method is 577 and 474 seconds for RapidEye and SPOT datasets, respectively. However, in the case of adopting the similarity-based MKL algorithms, these computational times respectively decreases to 4 and 2 seconds.

TI  - Estimating surface ice velocity on Chhota Shigri glacier from satellite data using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about the surface ice velocity is one of the important parameters for Mass balance and Glacier dynamics. This study estimates the surface ice velocity of Chhota Shigri glacier using Landsat (TM/ETM+) and ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) temporal data-sets from a period of 2009 to 2016 and 2006 to 2007, respectively. A correlation based Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique has been used for the estimation of surface ice velocity. This technique uses multiple window sizes in the same data-set. Four window sizes (low, medium, high, very high) are used for each image pair. Estimated results have been compared with the published data. The outcomes attained from the medium window size closely matches with the published results. The estimated mean surface ice velocities of medium window size are 24 and 28.5 myr(-1) for 2009/2010 and 2006/2007 images pair. Highest velocity is observed in middle part of the glacier while lowest in the accumulation zone of the glacier.

TI  - Exploring wetland transformations in moribund deltaic parts of India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Moribund deltaic part of Ganga-Padma region possesses hydro-ecologically precious dynamic wetlands of different kinds. The present paper endeavours to map, monitor wetlands and assess the changing hydro-ecological states of these in the moribund deltaic plain. Multi-temporal Landsat images since 1987-2016 are used for mapping and monitoring the wetlands. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Water Presence Frequency (WPF) approaches are applied for time series water body extraction and integration of water body maps for making frequency continuum of wetlands. The fragmentation analysis is done to show the transformation pattern of wetland landscape. Total wetland areas are 46.66 and 88.55 km(2) in pre- and postmonsoon seasons respectively. Out of the total wetlands area of pre and postmonsoon seasons 18.21 km(2) (54.09%), 35.83 km(2) (62.14%) areas respectively have witnessed transformation from phase I (1987-1996) to phase III (2006-2016). The Fragmentation statistics shows that 35% of medium and large core wetlands have been changed into smaller one and numerous small wetlands have been lost. Different landscape ecological indices like Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) and Simpson's diversity index (SIDI) depict disaggregated pattern of wetlands. Maintenance of ecologically relevant channel flow and inundation is highly essential for minimizing transformation.

TI  - Spatial near future modeling of land use and land cover changes in the temperate forests of Mexico
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss of temperate forests of Mexico has continued in recent decades despite wide recognition of their importance to maintaining biodiversity. This study analyzes land use/land cover change scenarios, using satellite images from the Landsat sensor. Images corresponded to the years 1990, 2005 and 2017. The scenarios were applied for the temperate forests with the aim of getting a better understanding of the patterns in land use/land cover changes. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) multispectral classification technique served to determine the land use/land cover types, which were validated through the Kappa Index. For the simulation of land use/land cover dynamics, a model developed in Dinamica-EGO was used, which uses stochastic models of Markov Chains, Cellular Automata and Weight of Evidences. For the study, a stationary, an optimistic and a pessimistic scenario were proposed. The projections based on the three scenarios were simulated for the year 2050. Five types of land use/land cover were identified and evaluated. They were primary forest, secondary forest, human settlements, areas without vegetation and water bodies. Results from the land use/land cover change analysis show a substantial gain for the secondary forest. The surface area of the primary forest was reduced from 55.8% in 1990 to 37.7% in 2017. Moreover, the three projected scenarios estimate further losses of the surface are for the primary forest, especially under the stationary and pessimistic scenarios. This highlights the importance and probably urgent implementation of conservation and protection measures to preserve these ecosystems and their services. Based on the accuracy obtained and on the models generated, results from these methodologies can serve as a decision tool to contribute to the sustainable management of the natural resources of a region.

TI  - Influenza surveillance: determining the epidemic threshold for influenza by using the Moving Epidemic Method (MEM), Montenegro, 2010/11 to 2017/18 influenza seasons
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 2009, an improved influenza surveillance system was implemented and weekly reporting to the World Health Organization on influenza-like illness (ILI) began. The goals of the surveillance system are to monitor and analyse the intensity of influenza activity, to provide timely information about circulating strains and to help in establishing preventive and control measures. In addition, the system is useful for comparative analysis of influenza data from Montenegro with other countries. Aim: We aimed to evaluate the performance and usefulness of the Moving Epidemic Method (MEM), for use in the influenza surveillance system in Montenegro. Methods: Historical ILI data from 2010/11 to 2017/18 influenza seasons were modelled with MEM. Epidemic threshold for Montenegro 2017/18 season was calculated using incidence rates from 2010/11-2016/17 influenza seasons. Results: Pre-epidemic ILI threshold per 100,000 population was 19.23, while the post-epidemic threshold was 17.55. Using MEM, we identified an epidemic of so weeks' duration. The sensitivity of the MEM epidemic threshold in Montenegro was 89% and the warning signal specificity was 99%. Conclusions: Our study marks the first attempt to determine the pre/postepidemic threshold values for the epidemic period in Montenegro. The findings will allow a more detailed examination of the influenza-related epidemiological situation, timely detection of epidemic and contribute to the development of more efficient measures for disease prevention and control aimed at reducing the influenza-associated morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Cloud base height retrieval from multi-angle satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are a key modulator of the Earth energy budget at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface. While the cloud top height is operationally retrieved with global coverage, only few methods have been proposed to determine cloud base height (z(base)) from satellite measurements. This study presents a new approach to retrieve cloud base heights using the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) on the Terra satellite. It can be applied if some cloud gaps occur within the chosen distance of typically 10 km. The MISR cloud base height (MIBase) algorithm then determines z(base) from the ensemble of all MISR cloud top heights retrieved at a 1.1 km horizontal resolution in this area. MIBase is first calibrated using 1 year of ceilometer data from more than 1500 sites within the continental United States of America. The 15th percentile of the cloud top height distribution within a circular area of 10 km radius provides the best agreement with the ground-based data. The thorough evaluation of the MIBase product z(base) with further ceilometer data yields a correlation coefficient of about 0.66, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach to retrieve z(base). The impacts of the cloud scene structure and macrophysical cloud properties are discussed. For a 3-year period, the median z(base) is generated globally on a 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees grid. Even though overcast cloud scenes and high clouds are excluded from the statistics, the median z(base) retrievals yield plausible results, in particular over ocean as well as for seasonal differences. The potential of the full 16 years of MISR data is demonstrated for the southeast Pacific, revealing interannual variability in z(base) in accordance with reanalysis data. The global cloud base data for the 3-year period (2007-2009) are available at https://doi.org/10.5880/CRC1211DB.19.

TI  - Carbon monoxide air pollution on sub-city scales and along arterial roads detected by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite provides measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) total column concentrations based on earthshine radiance measurements in the 2.3 mu m spectral range with a spatial resolution of 7km x 7km and daily global coverage. Due to the high accuracy of the observations, CO pollution can be detected over cities and industrial areas using single orbit overpasses. In this study, we analyzed local CO enhancements in an area around Iran from 1 November to 20 December 2017. We employed the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model v3.8.1 using the EDGAR v4.2 emission inventory and evaluated CO emissions from the cities of Tehran, Yerevan, Urmia, and Tabriz on a spatial resolution comparable to that of TROPOMI. For background conditions, the WRF simulation agrees well with TROPOMI CO, with a mean difference of 5.7 %. However, the emissions for the city area had to be significantly increased in order to match the observations. Moreover, significant differences at the sub-city scale remain. To match the TROPOMI CO observations around the Armenian city of Yerevan, it is necessary to introduce CO emissions along a southeast arterial road of Yerevan. Overall, this hints at deficits in the EDGAR inventory in the region around Iran and indicates TROPOMI's capability to identify localized CO pollution on sub-city scales, which at the same time challenges current atmospheric modeling at high spatial and temporal resolution.

TI  - Analysis of Sentinel-2 and RapidEye for Retrieval of Leaf Area Index in a Saltmarsh Using a Radiative Transfer Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel satellite fleet of the Copernicus Programme offers new potential to map and monitor plant traits at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Among these traits, leaf area index (LAI) is a crucial indicator of vegetation growth and an essential variable in biodiversity studies. Numerous studies have shown that the radiative transfer approach has been a successful method to retrieve LAI from remote-sensing data. However, the suitability and adaptability of this approach largely depend on the type of remote-sensing data, vegetation cover and the ecosystem studied. Saltmarshes are important wetland ecosystems threatened by sea level rise among other human- and animal-induced changes. Therefore, monitoring their vegetation status is crucial for their conservation, yet few LAI assessments exist for these ecosystems. In this study, the retrieval of LAI in a saltmarsh ecosystem is examined using Sentinel-2 and RapidEye data through inversion of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model. Field measurements of LAI and some other plant traits were obtained during two succeeding field campaigns in July 2015 and 2016 on the saltmarsh of Schiermonnikoog, a barrier island of the Netherlands. RapidEye (2015) and Sentinel-2 (2016) data were acquired concurrent to the time of the field campaigns. The broadly employed PROSAIL model was inverted using two look-up tables (LUTs) generated in the spectral band's settings of the two sensors and in which each contained 500,000 records. Different solutions from the LUTs, as well as, different Sentinel-2 spectral subsets were considered to examine the LAI retrieval. Our results showed that generally the LAI retrieved from Sentinel-2 had higher accuracy compared to RapidEye-retrieved LAI. Utilising the mean of the first 10 best solutions from the LUTs resulted in higher R-2 (0.51 and 0.59) and lower normalised root means square error (NRMSE) (0.24 and 0.16) for both RapidEye and Sentinel-2 data respectively. Among different Sentinel-2 spectral subsets, the one comprised of the four near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands resulted in higher estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0.44, NRMSE = 0.21) in comparison to using other studied spectral subsets. The results demonstrated the feasibility of broadband multispectral sensors, particularly Sentinel-2 for retrieval of LAI in the saltmarsh ecosystem via inversion of PROSAIL. Our results highlight the importance of proper parameterisation of radiative transfer models and capacity of Sentinel-2 spectral range and resolution, with impending high-quality global observation aptitude, for retrieval of plant traits at a global scale.

TI  - Cyanobacterial neurotoxin BMAA and brain pathology in stranded dolphins
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dolphin stranding events occur frequently in Florida and Massachusetts. Dolphins are an excellent sentinel species for toxin exposures in the marine environment. In this report we examine whether cyanobacterial neurotoxin, beta-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), is present in stranded dolphins. BMAA has been shown to bioaccumulate in the marine food web, including in the muscles and fins of sharks. Dietary exposure to BMAA is associated with the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles and beta-amyloid plaques in nonhuman primates. The findings of protein-bound BMAA in brain tissues from patients with Alzheimer's disease has advanced the hypothesis that BMAA may be linked to dementia. Since dolphins are apex predators and consume prey containing high amounts of BMAA, we examined necropsy specimens to determine if dietary and environmental exposures may result in the accumulation of BMAA in the brains of dolphins. To test this hypothesis, we measured BMAA in a series of brains collected from dolphins stranded in Florida and Massachusetts using two orthogonal analytical methods: 1) high performance liquid chromatography, and 2) ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. We detected high levels of BMAA (20-748 mu g/g) in the brains of 13 of 14 dolphins. To correlate neuropathological changes with toxin exposure, gross and microscopic examinations were performed on cortical brain regions responsible for acoustico-motor navigation. We observed increased numbers of beta-amyloid(+) plaques and dystrophic neurites in the auditory cortex compared to the visual cortex and brainstem. The presence of BMAA and neuropathological changes in the stranded dolphin brain may help to further our understanding of cyanotoxin exposure and its potential impact on human health.

TI  - Medicanes Triggering Chlorophyll Increase
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies have shown that hurricanes and typhoons, apart from being extreme weather phenomena, cause increases in marine chlorophyll-a concentrations and even phytoplankton blooms. Medicanes are the tropical-like Mediterranean cyclones that induce hazardous weather conditions as well. In this study, a couple of medicanes, over the central and eastern parts of the Sea, are examined for the first time in respect to their possible influence on chlorophyll concentrations. The affected area was delineated with the use of numerical model data, while the sea surface temperature and chlorophyll variations were assessed based on satellite-derived data. The results showed that medicanes trigger surface chlorophyll increases; after the cyclones' passage, the concentrations were higher compared both with those before and with the climatological monthly values over a large part of the affected area. The mechanisms proposed to explain hurricanes' favorable influence on chlorophyll concentration seem to be valid for medicanes as well. Area averaged chlorophyll concentrations presented analogous increases to the ones reported for hurricanes, though on a smaller scale. Despite the much lower intensity of medicanes compared with hurricanes, the observed increase in surface chlorophyll after their passage points to their favorable influence.

TI  - Groundwater Potential Mapping Using Data Mining Models of Big Data Analysis in Goyang-si, South Korea
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, data mining analysis techniques have been developed, as large spatial datasets have accumulated in various fields. Such a data-driven analysis is necessary in areas of high uncertainty and complexity, such as estimating groundwater potential. Therefore, in this study, data mining of various spatial datasets, including those based on remote sensing data, was applied to estimate groundwater potential. For the sustainable development of groundwater resources, a plan for the systematic management of groundwater resources should be established based on a quantitative understanding of the development potential. The purpose of this study was to map and analyze the groundwater potential of Goyang-si in Gyeonggi-do province, South Korea and to evaluate the sensitivity of each factor by applying data mining models for big data analysis. A total of 876 surveyed groundwater pumping capacity data were used, 50% of which were randomly classified into training and test datasets to analyze groundwater potential. A total of 13 factors extracted from satellite-based topographical, land cover, soil, forest, geological, hydrogeological, and survey-based precipitation data were used. The frequency ratio (FR) and boosted classification tree (BCT) models were used to analyze the relationships between the groundwater pumping capacity and related factors. Groundwater potential maps were constructed and validated with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, with accuracy rates of 68.31% and 69.39% for the FR and BCT models, respectively. A sensitivity analysis for both models was performed to assess the influence of each factor. The results of this study are expected to be useful for establishing an effective groundwater management plan in the future.

TI  - Evaluation of global historical land use scenarios based on regional datasets on the Qinghai-Tibet Area
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global historical land use scenarios are widely used to model human-induced climate change from the regional to global scales. It is necessary to conduct regional scale assessments of these global scenarios, identifying their uncertainties and pointing out directions for improvemeni. Based on the regional reconstruction Li-dataset, remotely sensed dataset, and grazing intensity dataset, the uncertainties of land use area and geographical distribution in HYDE3.1, HYDE3 2, and SAGE (a global land dataset from the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment) scenarios for the Qinghai-Tibet Area (QTA) are evaluated. The comparisons show that the crop-land areas on the QTA in HYDE3.2 for 1900-2000 are close to those of the Li-dataset, whereas HYDE3.1 underestimated and SAGE overestimated the cropland areas significantly. Spatially, HYDE3.1, HYDE3.2, and SAGE have large uncertainties, which cannot reflect the distribution of cropland on the QTA and its changes for 1900-2000 well, and too much cropland is allocated to southeastern Tibet. HYDE3.1 and HYDE3.2 overestimated the pasture area and its distribution on the QTA significantly. The distribution of pasture in SAGE showed overall an agreement with the spatial pattern for grazing intensity, but changes in grazing intensity for 2000-2010 was not reflected in SAGE The FAO pasture definition and estimates and the method of using population as a proxy for pasture area arc not appropriate for the QTA. Methodology which uses the pasture inventory data to calibrate satellite-based grassland maps to obtain the current pasture maps may also not be appropriate because of the lacking differentiation between natural and anihropogenic grasslands in remotely sensed data. More regional level land use estimates with concise definitions, define the land use more clearly, and stratification reconstruction based on differences in agro-climatic conditions and resource endowments may be used to improve global maps.

TI  - Tree Species Classification Using Hyperion and Sentinel-2 Data with Machine Learning in South Korea and China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) has been used to monitor inaccessible regions. It is considered a useful technique for deriving important environmental information from inaccessible regions, especially North Korea. In this study, we aim to develop a tree species classification model based on RS and machine learning techniques, which can be utilized for classification in North Korea. Two study sites were chosen, the Korea National Arboretum (KNA) in South Korea and Mt. Baekdu (MTB; a.k.a., Mt. Changbai in Chinese) in China, located in the border area between North Korea and China, and tree species classifications were examined in both regions. As a preliminary step in developing a classification algorithm that can be applied in North Korea, common coniferous species at both study sites, Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) and Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi), were chosen as targets for investigation. Hyperion data have been used for tree species classification due to the abundant spectral information acquired from across more than 200 spectral bands (i.e., hyperspectral satellite data). However, it is impossible to acquire recent Hyperion data because the satellite ceased operation in 2017. Recently, Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral imagery has been used in tree species classification. Thus, it is necessary to compare these two kinds of satellite data to determine the possibility of reliably classifying species. Therefore, Hyperion and Sentinel-2 data were employed, along with machine learning techniques, such as random forests (RFs) and support vector machines (SVMs), to classify tree species. Three questions were answered, showing that: (1) RF and SVM are well established in the hyperspectral imagery for tree species classification, (2) Sentinel-2 data can be used to classify tree species with RF and SVM algorithms instead of Hyperion data, and (3) training data that were built in the KNA cannot be used for the tree classification of MTB. Random forests and SVMs showed overall accuracies of 0.60 and 0.51 and kappa values of 0.20 and 0.00, respectively. Moreover, combined training data from the KNA and MTB showed high classification accuracies in both regions; RF and SVM values exhibited accuracies of 0.99 and 0.97 and kappa values of 0.98 and 0.95, respectively.

TI  - The effects of urbanization on China's forest loss from 2000 to 2012: Evidence from a panel analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest loss has severe impacts on global environment change and biodiversity. However, few studies have used panel models to analyze forest loss at the national level, attributed to the limited time-space series data on the forest loss at such large scale. The freely accessible Landsat images provide data to derive the global forest loss at a high spatial resolution of 30 m (Hansen et al., 2013), which make it possible to carry out this study. Here we used the global forest loss dataset as a data source, a space-time panel model for 31 provinces, autonomous regions, or municipalities in mainland of China from 2000 to 2012 were built to investigate the relationship between the urbanization process and the forest loss both at the national and regional level. The results indicated that (1) the forest loss area of each province were between 3 and 89 ha to more than 89 ha during 2001 and 2012, with larger area of forest loss in the southern and north-eastern regions, while less forest loss in the central and western region. (2) In the study period, the forest loss rates were more than 4% in the southern China, while the rates were less than 0.1% in most of the northwest China: and the annual forest loss demonstrated an aggravated trend in most provinces of China. (3) There exists a scale effect and regional divergence in the impact of urbanization on forest loss: urbanization level is among the most critical factor affecting forest loss at the national level; while at the regional level, the most sensitive factor for forest loss is road mileage in the eastern region, urban green area in the central region, while urban level in the western region. This study may help to advance the understanding of the impact of urbanization process on China's forest loss, and therefore it provides good policy implications to make more effective and comprehensive solutions to reduce the loss of forests.

TI  - Saharan dust and biomass burning aerosols during ex-hurricane Ophelia: observations from the new UK lidar and sun-photometer network
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 15-16 October 2017, ex-hurricane Ophelia passed to the west of the British Isles, bringing dust from the Sahara and smoke from Portuguese forest fires that was observable to the naked eye and reported in the UK's national press. We report here detailed observations of this event using the UK operational lidar and sun-photometer network, established for the early detection of aviation hazards, including volcanic ash. We also use ECMWF ERA5 wind field data and MODIS imagery to examine the aerosol transport. The observations, taken continuously over a period of 30 h, show a complex picture, dominated by several different aerosol layers at different times and clearly correlated with the passage of different air masses associated with the intense cyclonic system. A similar evolution was observed at several sites, with a time delay between them explained by their different location with respect to the storm and associated meteorological features. The event commenced with a shallow dust layer at 1-2 km in altitude and culminated in a deep and complex structure that lasted similar to 12 h at each site over the UK, correlated with the storm's warm sector. For most of the time, the aerosol detected was dominated by mineral dust mixtures, as highlighted by depolarisation measurements, but an intense biomass burning aerosol (BBA) layer was observed towards the end of the event, lasting around 3 h at each site. The aerosol optical depth at 355 nm (AOD(355)) during the whole event ranged from 0.2 to 2.9, with the larger AOD correlated to the intense BBA layer. Such a large AOD is unprecedented in the UK according to AERONET records for the last 20 years. The Raman lidars permitted the measurement of the aerosol extinction coefficient at 355 nm, the particle linear depolarisation ratio (PLDR), and the lidar ratio (LR) and made the separation of the dust (depolarising) aerosol from other aerosol types possible. A specific extinction has also been computed to provide an estimate of the atmospheric concentration of both aerosol types separately, which peaked at 420 +/- 200 mu g m(-3) for the dust and 558 +/- 232 mu g m(-3) for the biomass burning aerosols. Back trajectories computed using the Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment (NAME) were used to identify the sources and strengthen the conclusions drawn from the observations. The UK network represents a significant expansion of the observing capability in northern Europe, with instruments evenly distributed across Great Britain, from Camborne in Cornwall to Lerwick in the Shetland Islands, and this study represents the first attempt to demonstrate its capability and validate the methods in use. Its ultimate purpose will be the detection and quantification of volcanic plumes, but the present study clearly demonstrates the advanced capabilities of the network.

TI  - Effect of check dams on riparian vegetation cover: A multiscale approach based on field measurements and satellite images for Leaf Area Index assessment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to detect the variability of riparian vegetation by means of in-situ measurements of the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and its retrieval from Landsat 8 satellite images in a Mediterranean stream ('Cammarota', Puglia region, Southern Italy) characterized by the presence of intact and destroyed check dams. Fifty-three transects were measured using a Plant Canopy Analyzer and a broad range of LAI values (0.26-5.71) was observed. Lower values were found in Cammarota reaches with damaged or destroyed check dams that led to active erosive processes, whereas higher LAI values were detected in the reaches with greater geornorphological stability. These results were confirmed by the analysis of a nearby stream ('Vallone della Madonna') with intact check dams and sound riparian vegetation which produced a higher range (4.08-5.93) of LAI values. The LAI values of riparian vegetation in both streams were compared with those found in more homogeneous types of vegetation (wheat field and deciduous forest) in the surrounding areas, which were used as control plots. Landsat 8 satellite images relating to the same period afield activity were also analyzed, and the performance of three equations for deriving LAI values from the corrected Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was evaluated. The Lambert-Beer equation gave the best statistical performance for predicting LAI within the reaches of the Cammarota stream with a denser vegetation, as well as in the Vallone della Madonna stream and deciduous forest. The significant variability of the observed LAI values in the Cammarota reach subject to initial erosive processes, was not detected by any of the equations applied. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Network modularity influences plant reproduction in a mosaic tropical agroecosystem
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity influences ecosystem function, but there is limited understanding of the mechanisms that support this relationship across different land use types in mosaic agroecosystems. Network approaches can help to understand how community structure influences ecosystem function across landscapes; however, in ecology, network analyses have largely focused on species-species interactions. Here, we use bipartite network analysis in a novel way: to link pollinator communities to sites in a tropical agricultural landscape. We used sentinel plants of Brassica rapa to examine how the structure of the community network influences plant reproduction. Diptera was the most common order of flower visitors at every site. Syrphidae visits were the strongest contributor to the number of fertilized pods, while visits by Syrphidae, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera had the strongest effect on the number of seeds per pod. Sentinel pots at forest sites were visited by more unique species (i.e. species with higher d') than sites in other land uses, and dairy sites had more visitors that were common across the network. Participation coefficients, which indicate how connected a single node is across network modules, were strong predictors of ecosystem function: plant reproduction increased at sites with higher participation coefficients. Flower visitor taxa with higher participation coefficients also had the strongest effect on plant reproduction. Hymenoptera visits were the best predictor for participation coefficients but an Allograpta sp. (Diptera: Syrphidae) was the most influential flower visitor species in the landscape network. A diverse insect community contributed to plant reproduction and connection among nodes in this system. Identifying the 'keystone' flower visitor species and sites that have a strong influence on network structure is a significant step forward to inform conservation priorities and decision-making in diverse agroecosystems.

TI  - Vertical Structure of the Water Column at the Virgin Islands Shelf Break and Trough
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The steep US Virgin Islands Shelf Break (VISB) and the Virgin Islands Trough (VIT) at the Northeastern Caribbean Sea comprise a dynamic region of the Atlantic Ocean. In situ oceanographic data collected in the region during April 2017 were used to examine the spatial variability in temperature, density, salinity, and relative Chlorophyll-a. Analysis of data from the upper 300 m of the water column, that include deep and shallow water stations in the shelf break region, shows strong stratification of the water column. Stations shallower than 800 m along the shelf break are more variable in temperature, density, and salinity than those that are deeper than 800 m along the trough. For shallow stations, the mixed layer depth deepens along-shelf from West to East while at the deep stations the opposite occurs. Salinity maxima exhibit more variability in depth and range of values in the shallow stations compared to deep stations. Six different types of water masses that contribute to the strong stratification in the region were identified in our study: Caribbean Surface Water, Subtropical Underwater, Sargasso Sea Water, Tropical Atlantic Central Water, Antarctic Intermediate Water, and North Atlantic Deep Water. The upper level Caribbean Surface Water, Subtropical Underwater, and Sargasso Sea Water are present in shallow stations, indicating potential meridional intrusions from the VIT to the VISB which may not be resolved by current ocean circulation models and are not captured in satellite data. The analysis presented here indicates that competing physical processes may be controlling the vertical structure of the water column in the region and merit further examination.

TI  - Repeated praziquantel treatment and <i>Opisthorchis</i> <i>viverrini</i> infection: a population-based cross-sectional study in northeast Thailand
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Opisthorchis viverrini infection is highly prevalent in northeast Thailand. This liver fluke is classified as a carcinogen due to its causal links with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) development. Although treatment with praziquantel (PZQ) effectively cures O. viverrini infection, the prevalence remains high due to the traditional consumption of raw fish. Therefore, re-infection is common in the endemic community, leading to severe hepato-biliary morbidities including the fatal CCA. In this study, we evaluate the association between the frequency of previous PZQ treatment and current O. viverrini infections among Thai adults living in the endemic area of northeast Thailand.Methods: This study includes all participants who were screened for O. viverrini infection in the Cholangiocarcinoma Screening and Care Program (CASCAP), northeast Thailand. History of PZQ treatment was recorded using a health questionnaire. O. viverrini infections were diagnosed using urine antigen detection. Associations between PZQ and O. viverrini were determined by adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using multiple logistic regression.Results: Among participants, 27.7% had previously been treated once with PZQ, 8.2% twice, 2.8% three times, and 3.5% more than three times. Current O. viverrini prevalence was 17% (n = 524). Compared with participants who never used PZQ, the aOR for infection among those who used the drug once was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.88-1.37), twice was 1.19 (95% CI: 0.85-1.68), three times was 1.28 (95% CI: 0.74-2.21), and more than three times was 1.86 (95% CI: 1.18-2.93; P = 0.007).Conclusions: The population with a frequent history of PZQ use and still continued raw fish consumption showed high levels of repeated reinfection with O. viverrini. They were infected, treated and re-infected repeatedly. These findings suggest that certain participants continue raw fish consumption even after previous infection. This is a particular problem in highly endemic areas for O. viverrini and increases the risk of CCA.

TI  - Forest Growing Stock Volume Estimation in Subtropical Mountain Areas Using PALSAR-2 L-Band PolSAR Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest growing stock volume (GSV) extraction using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has been widely used in climate change research. However, the relationships between forest GSV and polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data in the mountain region of central China remain unknown. Moreover, it is challenging to estimate GSV due to the complex topography of the region. In this paper, we estimated the forest GSV from advanced land observing satellite-2 (ALOS-2) phased array-type L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR-2) full polarimetric SAR data based on ground truth data collected in Youxian County, Central China in 2016. An integrated three-stage (polarization orientation angle, POA; effective scattering area, ESA; and angular variation effect, AVE) correction method was used to reduce the negative impact of topography on the backscatter coefficient. In the AVE correction stage, a strategy for fine terrain correction was attempted to obtain the optimum correction parameters for different polarization channels. The elements on the diagonal of covariance matrix were used to develop forest GSV prediction models through five single-variable models and a multi-variable model. The results showed that the integrated three-stage terrain correction reduced the negative influence of topography and improved the sensitivity between the forest GSV and backscatter coefficients. In the three stages, the POA compensation was limited in its ability to reduce the impact of complex terrain, the ESA correction was more effective in low-local incidence angles area than high-local incidence angles, and the effect of the AVE correction was opposite to the ESA correction. The data acquired on 14 July 2016 was most suitable for GSV estimation in this study area due to its correlation with GSV, which was the strongest at HH, HV, and VV polarizations. The correlation coefficient values were 0.489, 0.643, and 0.473, respectively, which were improved by 0.363, 0.373, and 0.366 in comparison to before terrain correction. In the five single-variable models, the fitting performance of the Water-Cloud analysis model was the best, and the correlation coefficient R-2 value was 0.612. The constructed multi-variable model produced a better inversion result, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 70.965 m(3)/ha, which was improved by 22.08% in comparison to the single-variable models. Finally, the space distribution map of forest GSV was established using the multi-variable model. The range of estimated forest GSV was 0 to 450 m(3)/ha, and the mean value was 135.759 m(3)/ha. The study expands the application potential of PolSAR data in complex topographic areas; thus, it is helpful and valuable for the estimation of large-scale forest parameters.

TI  - Application of Remotely Sensed Imagery and Socioeconomic Surveys to Map Crop Choices in the Bekaa Valley (Lebanon)
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on remotely sensed imagery and socioeconomic data, this research analyzes the reasons why farmers choose one crop over another in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. This study mapped the area of the cultivated crop in 2017 with Sentinel-2 images. An accurate and new method was developed to extract the field boundaries from the evolution of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) profile throughout the season. We collected 386 GPS locations for fields that are used for crop cultivation, from which the NDVI profile was extracted. The 386 reference fields were separated into two groups: reference locations and test locations. The Euclidean distance (ED) was calculated between these two groups, and the classification was strongly correlated to the known crop type in the field (overall accuracy: 90%). Our study area cultivated wheat (32%), spring potatoes (25%), spring vegetables (27%), orchards (11%), vineyards (7%), and alfalfa (<1%). Socioeconomic surveys showed that farmers favored these crops over others on account of their profitability. Nonetheless, the surveys highlighted a paradox: despite the lack of a political frame for agriculture in Lebanon, farmers' crop choices strongly depend on a few existing policies.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Annual and Monthly Precipitation Data over the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Basin, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation plays an important role in the global water cycle, in addition to material and energy exchange processes. Therefore, obtaining precipitation data with a high spatial resolution is of great significance. We used a geographically weighted regression (GWR)-based downscaling model to downscale Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 precipitation data over the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLRYRB) from a resolution of 0.25 degrees to 1 km on an annual scale, and the downscaled results were calibrated using the geographical differential analysis (GDA) method. At present, either the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or a digital elevation model (DEM) is selected as the environmental variable in the downscaling models. However, studies have shown that the relationship between the NDVI and precipitation gradually weakens when precipitation exceeds a certain threshold. In contrast, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) overcomes the saturation shortcomings of the NDVI. Therefore, this study investigated the performances of EVI-derived and NDVI-derived downscaling models in downscaling TRMM precipitation data. The results showed that the NDVI performed better than the EVI in the annual downscaling model, possibly because this study used the annual average NDVI, which may have neutralized detrimental saturation effects. Moreover, the accuracy of the downscaling model could be effectively improved after correcting for residuals and calibrating the model with the GDA method. Subsequently, the downscaled rainfall was closer to the actual weather station rainfall observations. Furthermore, the downscaled results were decomposed into fractions to obtain monthly precipitation data, showing that the proposed method by utilizing the GDA method could improve not only the spatial resolution of remote sensing precipitation data, but also the accuracy of data.

TI  - Detection of breast cancer lymph node metastases in frozen sections with a point-of care low-cost microscope scanner
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundDetection of lymph node metastases is essential in breast cancer diagnostics and staging, affecting treatment and prognosis. lntraoperative microscopy analysis of sentinel lymph node frozen sections is standard for detection of axillary metastases but requires access to a pathologist for sample analysis. Remote analysis of digitized samples is an alternative solution but is limited by the requirement for high-end slide scanning equipment.ObjectiveTo determine whether the image quality achievable with a low-cost, miniature digital microscope scanner is sufficient for detection of metastases in breast cancer lymph node frozen sections.MethodsLymph node frozen sections from 79 breast cancer patients were digitized using a prototype miniature microscope scanner and a high-end slide scanner. Images were independently reviewed by two pathologists and results compared between devices with conventional light microscopy analysis as ground truth.ResultsDetection of metastases in the images acquired with the miniature scanner yielded an overall sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 99% and showed strong agreement when compared to light microscopy (k = 0.91). Strong agreement was also observed when results were compared to results from the high-end slide scanner (k = 0.94). A majority of discrepant cases were micrometastases and sections of which no anticytokeratin staining was available.ConclusionAccuracy of detection of metastatic cells in breast cancer sentinel lymph node frozen sections by visual analysis of samples digitized using low-cost, point-of-care microscopy is comparable to analysis of digital samples scanned using a high-end, whole slide scanner. This technique could potentially provide a workflow for digital diagnostics in resource-limited settings, facilitate sample analysis at the point-of-care and reduce the need for trained experts on-site during surgical procedures.

TI  - Algorithms for the classification and characterization of aerosols: utility verification of near-UV satellite observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol types were characterized and classified using multispectral satellite data. The role of near-UV data in the detection of absorbing aerosols, such as biomass burning aerosols (BBA) or mineral dust particles (DUST), was examined on a global scale. An absorbing aerosol index (AAI) was proposed and defined as the ratio of the satellite-observed radiance (R) at a wavelength of 0.412 mu m [R (0.412)] to that at 0.380 mu m [R (0.380)] that can also detect nonabsorbing-type aerosols. Initially, the numerical AAI values were estimated for the BBAs and DUST from measurements collected by the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-2/Global Imager (ADEOS-2/GLI). The Japanese short mission ADEOS-2 carried the GLI instrument with observation channels in the near-UV region. Not only the AAI index but also the short-wavelength infrared measurements were utilized to determine the dust detection index (DDI) defined as the ratio of R (2.210) to R (0.380) in order to discriminate BBAs from DUST. In addition, the AAI and DDI values were evaluated for the detection of clouds. The results allowed the classification criteria for DUST, BBA, other types of aerosols and clouds to be obtained. The Second-Generation Global Imager (SGLI) sensor is onboard the Japanese Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C) (SHIKISAI in Japanese) satellite launched on December 23, 2017. The SGLI has multiple channels (19) including near-UV and polarization sensors in the red and near-IR wavelengths. We also demonstrated the advantages of the SGLI for near-UV and polarization data for aerosol remote sensing. An understanding of aerosol types facilitated subsequent aerosol retrieval. Then, retrieval for classified aerosols was made based on the radiation simulations with multispectral radiance by GLI and polarization measurements by Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER)-2, respectively, mounted on the ADEOS-2 satellite. The proposed algorithms are expected to be available not only for the analysis of the SGLI data but also for other future missions. (C) The Authors.

TI  - A New Wetness Index to Evaluate the Soil Water Availability Influence on Gross Primary Production of European Forests
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rising temperature, drought and more-frequent extreme climatic events have been predicted for the next decades in many regions around the globe. In this framework, soil water availability plays a pivotal role in affecting vegetation productivity, especially in arid or semi-arid environments. However, direct measurements of soil moisture are scarce, and modeling estimations are still subject to biases. Further investigation on the effect of soil moisture on plant productivity is required. This study aims at analyzing spatio-temporal variations of a modified temperature vegetation wetness index (mTVWI), a proxy of soil moisture, and evaluating its effect on gross primary production (GPP) in forests. The study was carried out in Europe on 19 representative tree species during the 2000-2010 time period. Results outline a north-south gradient of mTVWI with minimum values (low soil water availability) in Southern Europe and maximum values (high soil water availability) in Northeastern Europe. A low soil water availability negatively affected GPP from 20 to 80%, as a function of site location, tree species, and weather conditions. Such a wetness index improves our understanding of water stress impacts, which is crucial for predicting the response of forest carbon cycling to drought and aridity.

TI  - Long-Term Annual Surface Water Change in the Brazilian Amazon Biome: Potential Links with Deforestation, Infrastructure Development and Climate Change
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Amazon is one of the areas on the planet with the fastest changes in forest cover due to deforestation associated with agricultural expansion and infrastructure development. These drivers of change, directly and indirectly, affect the water ecosystem. In this study, we present a long-term spatiotemporal analysis of surface water annual change and address potential connections with deforestation, infrastructure expansion and climate change in this region. To do that, we used the Landsat Data Archive (LDA), and Earth Engine cloud computing platform, to map and analyze annual water changes between 1985 and 2017. We detected and estimated the extent of surface water using a novel sub-pixel classifier based on spectral mixture analysis, followed by a post-classification segmentation approach to isolate and classify surface water in natural and anthropic water bodies. Furthermore, we combined these results with deforestation and infrastructure development maps of roads, hydroelectric dams to quantify surface water changes linked with them. Our results showed that deforestation dramatically disrupts small streams, new hydroelectric dams inundated landmass after 2010 and that there is an overall trend of reducing surface water in the Amazon Biome and watershed scales, suggesting a potential connection to more recent extreme droughts in the 2010s.

TI  - Land Use Evaluation over the Jema Watershed, in the Upper Blue Nile River Basin, Northwestern Highlands of Ethiopia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Generating land capability class guidelines at a watershed scale has become a priority in sustainable agricultural land use. This study analyzed the area of cultivated land use situated on the non-arable land-capability class in the Jema watershed in the Upper Blue Nile River Basin. Soil surveys, meteorological ground observations, a digital elevation model (DEM) at 30 m, Meteosat at 10 km x 10 km and Landsat at 30 m were used to generate the sample soil texture class, average annual total rainfall (ATRF in mm), terrain, slope (%), elevation (m a.s.l) and land-use land cover (%). The land capability class was analyzed by considering raster layers of terrain, the average ATRF and soil texture. Geo-statistics was employed to fit a surface of soil texture and average ATRF estimates. An overlay technique was used to compute the proportion of cultivated land placed on non-arable land. As per the results of the terrain analysis, the elevation (m a.s.l) of the watershed is in the range of 1895 to 3518 m. The slope was found to be in the range of 0 to 45%. The amount of estimated rainfall ranged from 1640 to 131 mm with value declined from the lower to the higher elevation. Clay loam, clay and heavy clay were found to be the major soil texture classes. Four land capability classes, i.e., II, III, IV (arable) and V (non-arable), were identified with proportions of 28.56%, 45.74%, 22.16% and 3.54%, respectively. Seven land-use land covers were identified, i.e., annual crop land, grazing land, bush land, bare land, settlement land, forestland and water bodies, with proportions of 42.1, 35.9, 8.90, 8.3, 2.6, 2.1, and 0.2, respectively. Around 1707.7 ha of land in the watershed is categorized under non-arable land that cannot be used for annual crop cultivation at any level of intensity. Around 437 ha (3.5%) of land was cultivated on non-arable land. To conclude, the observed unsustainable crop land use could maximize soil loss in upstream regions and siltation and flooding downstream. The annual crop land use that was observed on non-arable land needs to be replaced with perennial crops, pasture and/or forest land uses.

TI  - Monitoring the Degradation of Island Permafrost Using Time-Series InSAR Technique: A Case Study of Heihe, China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global warming, the air temperature of the Heihe basin in Northeast China has increased significantly, resulting in the degradation of the island permafrost. In this paper, we used an elaborated time-series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) strategy to monitor the ground deformation in the Heihe area (Heilongjiang Province, China) and then analyzed the permafrost deformation characteristics from June 2007 to December 2010. The results showed that the region presented island permafrost surface deformation, and the deformation rate along the line of sight mainly varied from -70 to 70 mm/a. Based on the analysis of remote sensing and topological measurements, we found that the deformation area generally occurred at lower altitudes and on shady slopes, which is consistent with the distribution characteristics of permafrost islands. Additionally, the deformation of permafrost is highly correlated with the increase of annual minimum temperature, with an average correlation value of -0.80. The accelerated degradation of permafrost in the study area led to the settlement, threatening the infrastructure safety. Our results reveal accelerated degradation characteristics for the island permafrost under the background of rising air temperature, and provide a reference for future relevant research.

TI  - Applicability of Remote Sensing-Based Vegetation Water Content in Modeling Lightning-Caused Forest Fire Occurrences
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, our aim was to model forest fire occurrences caused by lightning using the variable of vegetation water content over six fire-dominant forested natural subregions in Northern Alberta, Canada. We used eight-day composites of surface reflectance data at 500-m spatial resolution, along with historical lightning-caused fire occurrences during the 2005-2016 period, derived from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. First, we calculated the normalized difference water index (NDWI) as an indicator of vegetation/fuel water content over the six natural subregions of interest. Then, we generated the subregion-specific annual dynamic median NDWI during the 2005-2012 period, which was assembled into a distinct pattern every year. We plotted the historical lightning-caused fires onto the generated patterns, and used the concept of cumulative frequency to model lightning-caused fire occurrences. Then, we applied this concept to model the cumulative frequencies of lightning-caused fires using the median NDWI values in each natural subregion. By finding the best subregion-specific function (i.e., R-2 values over 0.98 for each subregion), we evaluated their performance using an independent subregion-specific lightning-caused fire dataset acquired during the 2013-2016 period. Our analyses revealed strong relationships (i.e., R-2 values in the range of 0.92 to 0.98) between the observed and modeled cumulative frequencies of lightning-caused fires at the natural subregion level throughout the validation years. Finally, our results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method in modeling lightning-caused fire occurrences over forested regions.

TI  - Comparative analysis of index and chemometric techniques-based assessment of leaf area index (LAI) in wheat through field spectroradiometer, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Hyperion bands
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Successful retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) from hyperspectral remote sensing relies on the proper selection of indices or multivariate models. The objectives of the research work were to identify best vegetation index and multivariate model based on canopy reflectance and LAI measured at different growth stages of wheat. Comparison of existing indices revealed optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) as the best index based on R-2 of calibration, validation and root mean square error of validation. Proposed ratio index (RI; R-670, R-845) and normalized difference index (NDI; R-670, R-845) provided comparable performance with the existing vegetation indices (R-2 = 0.65 and 0.62 for RI and NDI, respectively, during validation). Among the multivariate models, partial least squares regression (PLSR) model with Hyperion band configuration performed the best during validation (R-2 = 0.80 and RMSE = 0.58 m(2) m(-2)). Our results manifested the opportunities for developing biophysical products based on satellite sensors.

TI  - Mapping Soil Moisture at a High Resolution over Mountainous Regions by Integrating In Situ Measurements, Topography Data, and MODIS Land Surface Temperatures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydro-agricultural applications often require surface soil moisture (SM) information at high spatial resolutions. In this study, daily spatial patterns of SM at a spatial resolution of 1 km over the Babao River Basin in northwestern China were mapped using a Bayesian-based upscaling algorithm, which upscaled point-scale measurements to the grid-scale (1 km) by retrieving SM information using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived land surface temperature (LST) and topography data (including aspect and elevation data) and in situ measurements from a wireless sensor network (WSN). First, the time series of pixel-scale (1 km) representative SM information was retrieved from in situ measurements of SM, topography data, and LST. Second, Bayesian linear regression was used to calibrate the relationship between the representative SM and the WSN measurements. Last, the calibrated relationship was used to upscale a network of in situ measured SM to map spatially continuous SM at a high resolution. The upscaled SM data were evaluated against ground-based SM measurements with satisfactory accuracy-the overall correlation coefficient (r), slope, and unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) values were 0.82, 0.61, and 0.025 m(3)/m(3), respectively. Moreover, when accounting for topography, the proposed upscaling algorithm outperformed the algorithm based only on SM derived from LST (r = 0.80, slope = 0.31, and ubRMSD = 0.033 m(3)/m(3)). Notably, the proposed upscaling algorithm was able to capture the dynamics of SM under extreme dry and wet conditions. In conclusion, the proposed upscaled method can provide accurate high-resolution SM estimates for hydro-agricultural applications.

TI  - Identification of a Threshold Minimum Area for Reflectance Retrieval from Thermokarst Lakes and Ponds Using Full-Pixel Data from Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermokarst waterbodies caused by permafrost thawing and degradation are ubiquitous in many subarctic and Arctic regions. They are globally important components of the biogeochemical carbon cycle and have potential feedback effects on climate. These northern waters are mostly small lakes and ponds, and although they may be mapped using very high-resolution satellites or aerial photography, these approaches are generally not suitable for monitoring purposes, due to the cost and limited availability of such images. In this study we evaluated the potential use of widely available high-resolution imagery from Sentinel-2 (S2) for the characterization of the spectral reflectance of thermokarst lakes and ponds. Specifically, we aimed to define the minimum lake area that could be reliably imaged, and to identify challenges and solutions for remote sensing of such waters in the future. The study was conducted in subarctic Canada, in the vicinity of Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik (Nunavik, Quebec), an area in the sporadic permafrost zone with numerous thermokarst waterbodies that vary greatly in size. Ground truthing lake reflectance data were collected using an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) fitted with a multispectral camera that collected images at 13 cm resolution. The results were compared with reflectance from Sentinel-2 images, and the effect of lake area on the reflectance response was assessed. Our results show that Sentinel-2 imagery was suitable for waterbodies larger than 350 m(2) once their boundaries were defined, which in the two test sites would allow monitoring from 11% to 30% of the waterbodies and 73% to 85% of the total lake area. Challenges for remote sensing of small lakes include the confounding effects of water reflection (both direct radiation and diffuse), wind and shadow. Given the small threshold area and frequent revisit time, Sentinel-2 provides a valuable approach towards the continuous monitoring of waterbodies, including ponds and small lakes such as those found in thermokarst landscapes. UASs provide a complementary approach for ground truthing and boundary definition.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation in a Deep Lake from Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - We mapped the extent of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) of Lake Iseo (Northern Italy, over the 2015-2017 period based on satellite data (Sentinel 2 A-B) and in-situ measurements; the objective was to investigate its spatiotemporal variability. We focused on the southern sector of the lake, the location of the shallowest littorals and the most developed macrophyte communities, mainly dominated by Vallisneria spiralis and Najas marina. The method made use of both in-situ measurements and satellite data (22 Sentinel 2 A-B images) that were atmospherically corrected with 6SV code and processed with the BOMBER (Bio-Optical Model-Based tool for Estimating water quality and bottom properties from Remote sensing images). This modeling system was used to estimate the different substrate coverage (bare sediment, dense stands of macrophytes with high albedo, and sparse stand of macrophytes with low albedo). The presented results substantiate the existence of striking inter- and intra-annual variations in the spatial-cover patterns of SAV. Intense uprooting phenomena were also detected, mainly affecting V. spiralis, a species generally considered a highly plastic pioneer taxon. In this context, remote sensing emerges as a very reliable tool for mapping SAV with satisfactory accuracy by offering new perspectives for expanding our comprehension of lacustrine macrophyte dynamics and overcoming some limitations associated with traditional field surveys.

TI  - Village Regrouping in the Eastern Plains of China: A Perspective on Home-Field Distance
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural decline caused by rapid urbanization is a global issue, and village regrouping is an effective way to revitalize the countryside. The eastern plains of China (EPC) were the first regions to implement the policy of village regrouping in China. Despite being one of the most critical factors in village regrouping, home-field distances (HFDs) in these areas have received little attention. In this study, we selected 240 sample points in the EPC through spatial stratified sampling, each of which is a square of 10 x 10 km(2). Based on high-resolution remote sensing images, the inter-regional differences of rural settlements and home-field straight-line distances (HFLDs) in the EPC were systematically analyzed. Based on the central place theory (CPT), the influencing mechanism of the HFLD, the maximum HFLD acceptable to farmers, and the reasonable number, distribution pattern, and service scope of central villages in the EPC were further explored. The results indicate that HFLDs in the EPC have significant latitude zonality and spatial autocorrelation. In the northeastern China plain (NECP), north China plain (NCP), and middle and lower reaches plain of the Yangtze River (MLPYR), the ranges of the maximum HFLD are 1000-4000 m, 500-2200 m, and 500-1500 m, respectively. The distribution pattern of rural settlements, the traffic conditions, and the vehicles used by farmers during periods of land development directly impact the HFLD. HFLDs in the EPC should not exceed 3.6-4.2 km (NECP can use the higher standard-4.2 km, NCP and MLPYR can use the lower standard-3.6 km), the service range of each rural settlement should not exceed 33.6-45.8 km(2), and the number of rural settlements per 100 km(2) should be greater than three. The rural settlements should be discretely distributed so that each piece of farmland can be tended. The MLPYR demonstrates the greatest potential for village regrouping, and the Chinese government should invest more funds in village regrouping and central village construction in the MLPYR. This study can provide a case study for developing countries in the urbanization phase, so as to improve the rationality of village regrouping planning.

TI  - Assessment of the X- and C-Band Polarimetric SAR Data for Plastic-Mulched Farmland Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a classification of plastic-mulched farmland (PMF) and other land cover types using full polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data and dual polarimetric (HH, VV) TerraSAR-X data, acquired from a test site in Hebei, China, where the main land covers include PMF, bare soil, winter wheat, urban areas and water. The main objectives were to evaluate the outcome of using high-resolution TerraSAR-X data for classifying PMF and other land covers and to compare classification accuracies based on different synthetic aperture radar bands and polarization parameters. Initially, different polarimetric indices were calculated, while polarimetric decomposition methods were used to obtain the polarimetric decomposition components. Using these polarimetric components as input, the random forest supervised classification algorithm was applied in the classification experiments. Our results show that in this study full-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data produced the most accurate overall classification (94.81%), indicating that full polarization is vital to distinguishing PMF from other land cover types. Dual polarimetric data had similar levels of classification error for PMF and bare soil, yielding mapping accuracies of 53.28% and 59.48% (TerraSAR-X), and 59.56% and 57.1% (RADARSAT-2), respectively. We found that Shannon entropy made the greatest contribution to accuracy in all three experiments, suggesting that it has great potential to improve agricultural land use classifications based on remote sensing.

TI  - Marine liquid cloud geometric thickness retrieved from OCO-2's oxygen A-band spectrometer
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces the OCO2CLD-LIDAR-AUX product, which uses the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) lidar and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) hyperspectral A-band spectrometer. CALIPSO provides a prior cloud top pressure (P-top) for an OCO-2-based retrieval of cloud optical depth, P-top and cloud geometric thickness expressed in hPa. Measurements are of single-layer liquid clouds over oceans from September 2014 to December 2016 when collocated data are available. Retrieval performance is best for solar zenith angles <45 degrees and when the cloud phase classification, which also uses OCO-2's weak CO2 band, is more confident. The highest quality optical depth retrievals agree with those from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with discrepancies smaller than the MODIS-reported uncertainty. Retrieved thicknesses are consistent with a substantially subadiabatic structure over marine stratocumulus regions, in which extinction is weighted towards the cloud top. Cloud top pressure in these clouds shows a 4 hPa bias compared with CALIPSO which we attribute mainly to the assumed vertical structure of cloud extinction after showing little sensitivity to the presence of CALIPSO-identified aerosol layers or assumed cloud droplet effective radius. This is the first case of success in obtaining internal cloud structure from hyperspectral A-band measurements and exploits otherwise unused OCO-2 data. This retrieval approach should provide additional constraints on satellite-based estimates of cloud droplet number concentration from visible imagery, which rely on parameterization of the cloud thickness.

TI  - Operational Large-Scale Segmentation of Imagery Based on Iterative Elimination
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image classification and interpretation are greatly aided through the use of image segmentation. Within the field of environmental remote sensing, image segmentation aims to identify regions of unique or dominant ground cover from their attributes such as spectral signature, texture and context. However, many approaches are not scalable for national mapping programmes due to limits in the size of images that can be processed. Therefore, we present a scalable segmentation algorithm, which is seeded using k-means and provides support for a minimum mapping unit through an innovative iterative elimination process. The algorithm has also been demonstrated for the segmentation of time series datasets capturing both the intra-image variation and change regions. The quality of the segmentation results was assessed by comparison with reference segments along with statistics on the inter- and intra-segment spectral variation. The technique is computationally scalable and is being actively used within the national land cover mapping programme for New Zealand. Additionally, 30-m continental mosaics of Landsat and ALOS-PALSAR have been segmented for Australia in support of national forest height and cover mapping. The algorithm has also been made freely available within the open source Remote Sensing and GIS software Library (RSGISLib).

T2  - NURSE RESEARCHER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Developing a conceptual framework to underpin the design of qualitative research is often regarded as integral in enhancing its trustworthiness. However, this can often present a challenge to the novice researcher.Aim To discuss the approach taken to develop the conceptual framework underpinning a constructivist grounded theory doctoral research study.Discussion Drawing on a clear and accessible approach can help researchers to develop a conceptual framework to underpin qualitative research. A recognised example of such an approach requires the researcher to address three main elements: personal interest, topical research and the theoretical framework. Constructing a conceptual framework to underpin qualitative research can afford it structure and lay the foundations to support trustworthiness. Conceptual frameworks are often developed through a dynamic and iterative process that evolves throughout the research process.Conclusion Using an accessible and unambiguous approach to support the development of a conceptual framework can benefit novice researchers and minimise the challenges they may encounter. One such approach guides researchers to clarify a personal interest in the topic, undertake a topical review of the literature informing the area of investigation and articulate the theoretical perspectives that influence their worldview.Implications for practice The discussion presented in this paper offers a valuable contribution to help novice researchers to construct conceptual frameworks.

AB  - Remote sensing applications in water resources management are quite essential in watershed characterization, particularly when mega basins are under investigation. Water quality parameters help in decision making regarding the further use of water based on its quality. Water quality parameters of chlorophyll a concentration, nitrate concentration, and water turbidity were used in the current study to estimate the water quality parameters in the dam lake of Wadi Baysh, Saudi Arabia. Water quality parameters were collected daily over 2 years (2017-2018) from the water treatment station located within the dam vicinity and were correspondingly tested against remotely sensed water quality parameters. Remote sensing data were collected from Sentinel-2 sensor, European Space Agency (ESA) on a satellite temporal resolution basis. Data were pre-processed then processed to estimate the maximum chlorophyll index (MCI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) and normalized difference turbidity index (NDTI). Zonal statistics were used to improve the regression analysis between the spatial data estimated from the remote sensing images and the nonspatial data collected from the water treatment plant. Results showed different correlation coefficients between the ground truth collected data and the corresponding indices conducted from remote sensing data. Actual chlorophyll a concentration showed high correlation with estimated MCI mean values with an R-2 of 0.96, actual nitrate concentration showed high correlation with the estimated GNDVI mean values with an R-2 of 0.94, and the actual water turbidity measurements showed high correlation with the estimated NDTI mean values with an R-2 of 0.94. The research findings support the use of remote sensing data of Sentinel-2 to estimate water quality parameters in arid environments.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Retrieval from Sentinel-3A Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer, Using a Split-Window Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter in the interaction between the ground and the atmosphere. The Sentinel-3A Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) provides global daily coverage of day and night observation in the wavelength range of 0.55 to 12.0 mu m. LST retrieved from SLSTR is expected to be widely used in different fields of earth surface monitoring. This study aimed to develop a split-window (SW) algorithm to estimate LST from two-channel thermal infrared (TIR) and one-channel middle infrared (MIR) images of SLSTR observation. On the basis of the conventional SW algorithm, using two TIR channels for the daytime observation, the MIR data, with a higher atmospheric transmittance and a lower sensitivity to land surface emissivity, were further used to develop a modified SW algorithm for the nighttime observation. To improve the retrieval accuracy, the algorithm coefficients were obtained in different subranges, according to the view zenith angle, column water vapor, and brightness temperature. The proposed algorithm can theoretically estimate LST with an error lower than 1 K on average. The algorithm was applied to northern China and southern UK, and the retrieved LST captured the surface features for both daytime and nighttime. Finally, ground validation was conducted over seven sites (four in the USA and three in China). Results showed that LST could be estimated with an error mostly within 1.5 to 2.5 K from the algorithm, and the error of the nighttime algorithm involved with MIR data was about 0.5 K lower than the daytime algorithm.

TI  - Preliminary Assessment of Turbidity and Chlorophyll Impact on Bathymetry Derived from Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-3A Satellites in South Florida
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of the impact of turbidity on satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) is a crucial step for selecting optimal scenes and for addressing the limitations of SDB. This study examines the relatively high-resolution MultiSpectral instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2A (10-20-60 m) and the moderate-resolution Ocean and Land Color instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3A (300 m) for generating bathymetric maps through a conventional ratio transform model in environments with some turbidity in South Florida. Both sensors incorporate additional spectral bands in the red-edge near infrared (NIR) region, allowing turbidity detection in optically shallow waters. The ratio model only requires two calibration parameters for vertical referencing using available chart data, whereas independent lidar surveys are used for validation and error analysis. The MSI retrieves bathymetry at 10 m with errors of 0.58 m at depths ranging between 0-18 m (limit of lidar survey) in West Palm Beach and of 0.22 m at depths ranging between 0-5 m in Key West, in conditions with low turbidity. In addition, this research presents an assessment of the SDB depth limit caused by turbidity as determined with the reflectance of the red-edge bands at 709 nm (OLCI) and 704 nm (MSI) and a standard ocean color chlorophyll concentration. OLCI and MSI results are comparable, indicating the potential of the two optical missions as interchangeable sensors that can help determine the selection of the optimal scenes for SDB mapping. OLCI can provide temporal data to identify water quality characteristics and general SDB patterns. The relationship of turbidity with depth detection may help to enhance the operational use of SDB over environments with varying water transparency conditions, particularly in remote and inaccessible regions of the world.

TI  - Toward Improving Short-Term Predictions of Fine Particulate Matter Over the United States Via Assimilation of Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth Retrievals
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops a new approach to improve simulations of the particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model via assimilation of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals using the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system. In contrast to previous studies that only consider errors due to transport, our computation of the background error covariance matrix incorporates uncertainties in anthropogenic emissions. To understand the impact of this approach, three experiments (one background and two assimilations) are performed over the contiguous United States (CONUS) from 15 July to 14 August 2014. The background CMAQ experiment significantly underestimates both the MODIS AOD and surface PM2.5 levels. MODIS AOD assimilation pushes both the CMAQ AOD and surface PM2.5 distributions toward the observed distributions, but CMAQ still underestimates the observations. Averaged over CONUS, the two assimilation experiments with and without including the anthropogenic emission uncertainties improve the correlation coefficient between the model and independent observations of PM2.5 by similar to 67% and similar to 48%, respectively, and reduces the mean bias by similar to 38% and similar to 10%, respectively. The assimilation improves the model performance everywhere over CONUS, except the New York and Wisconsin, where CMAQ overestimates the observed PM2.5 during nighttime after assimilation likely because of overcorrection of aerosol mass concentrations by the AOD assimilation. Future work should incorporate uncertainties in other processes (biomass burning and biogenic emissions, deposition, chemistry, transport, and boundary conditions) to further enhance the value of assimilating spaceborne AOD retrievals.

TI  - Improving Land Surface Temperature Simulation in CoLM Over the Tibetan Plateau Through Fractional Vegetation Cover Derived From a Remotely Sensed Clumping Index and Model-Simulated Leaf Area Index
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Parameterizations of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) in land surface models have important effects on simulations of surface energy budget, especially in arid and semiarid regions. This study uses a FVC scheme in which FVC is derived from leaf area index and a remotely sensed clumping index. The performance of the new scheme (SMFVC) is evaluated against Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) and in situ soil temperature observations, together with two other FVC schemes, a general FVC scheme (CTL) based on land cover map and a climatology-based FVC scheme (RSFVC) that uses long-term remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of MODIS. The three FVC schemes were implemented in the Common Land Model (CoLM) and applied in the Tibetan Plateau using the same forcing data and default parameters. Our results demonstrate that FVC schemes have significant influence on the CoLM performance: (1) the RSFVC and SMFVC schemes significantly reduce the LST biases found in CTL, particularly in grassland and during summer; (2) soil temperature evaluation by in situ observations from three networks on the Tibetan Plateau corroborates the LST results; and (3) the improvements are mainly related to representing temporal (seasonal) variability and subgrid heterogeneity of FVC, which improves surface albedo and surface energy balance. In other words, by including more vegetation characteristics, such as using a clumping index, land surface models may better simulate surface vegetation condition and further better represent the land surface energy budget over the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Possible Role of the Diurnal Cycle in Land Convection in the Barrier Effect on the MJO by the Maritime Continent
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Possible effects of the diurnal cycle in land convection on propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation over the Indo-Pacific Maritime Continent (MC) were investigated using satellite observations. Four features distinguishable from their respective climatology are uniquely associated with MJO events that cross the MC: strong precipitation over land as their convection centers approach the MC, subsequent increased soil moisture, reduced diurnal amplitude of land convection, and the dominance of precipitation over water by nondiurnal convection as their convection centers move over the MC. These results provide observational evidence for a proposed MAritime Continent Convective diurnal Cycle mechanism in which the diurnal cycle in land convection acts as an intrinsic barrier effect on MJO propagation over the MC.Plain Language Summary By influencing global weather and climate, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) plays a central role in intraseasonal prediction. But when it propagates over the Indo-Pacific Maritime Continent (MC), the MJO often weakens and sometimes breaks down and ceases to exist. This is known as the barrier effect of the MC. The reason for this barrier effect is not well understood. Through diagnosing satellite data of precipitation and soil moisture, this study provides observational evidence for several steps in a MAritime Continent Convective diurnal Cycle mechanism, in which the diurnal cycle in land convection acts as an intrinsic barrier effect that must be overcome for the MJO to propagate through the MC. The observations show that increased soil moisture reduces the amplitude of diurnal convection over land, allowing convective systems over water of the MC to develop and carry MJO signals through the MC.

TI  - InSAR Meteorology: High-Resolution Geodetic Data Can Increase Atmospheric Predictability
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study assesses the added value of high-resolution maps of precipitable water vapor, computed from synthetic aperture radar interferograms , in short-range atmospheric predictability. A large set of images, in different weather conditions, produced by Sentinel-1A in a very well monitored region near the Appalachian Mountains, are assimilated by the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. Results covering more than 2 years of operation indicate a consistent improvement of the water vapor predictability up to a range comparable with the transit time of the air mass in the synthetic aperture radar interferograms footprint, an overall improvement in the forecast of different precipitation events, and better representation of the spatial distribution of precipitation. This result highlights the significant potential for increasing short-range atmospheric predictability from improved high-resolution precipitable water vapor initial data, which can be obtained from new high-resolution all-weather microwave sensors.Plain Language Summary Weather forecasts will never be perfect because our models are simplified representations of nature and our observations of the atmosphere are inaccurate. In this study we show, nevertheless, that it is possible to improve such forecasts by interpreting the atmospheric signals in spaceborne radar observations of the Earth surface, indicative of the distribution of water vapor. Better and more detailed maps of water vapor are found to lead to better forecasts not just of water vapor but also of precipitation. A two and a half years assessment covering a wide range of weather conditions in a very well monitored region near the Appalachian Mountains, USA, suggests that the proposed methodology has a significant impact in the quality of the forecasts and could easily be implemented.

TI  - Estimation of Carbon Fluxes from Eddy Covariance Data and Satellite-Derived Vegetation Indices in a Karst Grassland (Podgorski Kras, Slovenia)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eddy Covariance method (EC) is widely used for measuring carbon (C) and energy fluxes at high frequency between the atmosphere and the ecosystem, but has some methodological limitations and a spatial restriction to an area, called a footprint. Remotely sensed information is usually used in combination with eddy covariance data in order to estimate C fluxes over larger areas. In fact, spectral vegetation indices derived from available satellite data can be combined with EC measurements to estimate C fluxes outside of the tower footprint. Following this approach, the present study aimed to model C fluxes for a karst grassland in Slovenia. Three types of model were considered: (1) a linear relationship between Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) or Gross Primary Production (GPP) and each vegetation index; (2) a linear relationship between GPP and the product of a vegetation index with PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation); and (3) a simplified LUE (Light Use-Efficiency) model assuming a constant LUE. We compared the performance of several vegetation indices derived from two remote platforms (Landsat and Proba-V) as predictors of NEE and GPP, based on three accuracy metrics, the coefficient of determination (R-2), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Two types of aggregation of flux data were explored: midday average and daily average fluxes. The vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was used to separate the growing season into two phases, a wet and a dry phase, which were considered separately in the modelling process, in addition to the growing season as a whole. The results showed that NDVI is the best predictor of GPP and NEE during the wet phase, whereas water-related vegetation indices, namely LSWI and MNDWI, were the best predictors during the dry phase, both for midday and daily aggregates. Model 1 (linear relationship) was found to be the best in many cases. The best regression equations obtained were used to map GPP and NEE for the whole study area. Digital maps obtained can practically contribute, in a cost-effective way to the management of karst grasslands.

TI  - Remarkable Control of Western Boundary Currents by <i>Eddy Killing</i>, a Mechanical Air-Sea Coupling Process
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Western boundary currents (WBCs) are critical to Earth's climate. In the last decade, mesoscale air-sea interactions emerged as an important factor of WBC dynamics. Recently, coupled models including the feedback of surface oceanic currents to the atmosphere confirmed the existence of a physical process called eddy killing, which may correct long-lasting biases in the representation of WBCs by providing an unambiguous energy sink mechanism. Using ocean-atmosphere coupled simulations of the Gulf Stream and the Agulhas Current, we show that eddy killing reduces the eddy-mean flow interaction (both forward and inverse cascades) and leads to more realistic solutions. Model and data fluxes are in good agreement when the same coarse grid is used for their computation, although in this case they are underestimated. We conclude that the uncoupled approach is no longer suitable for continued ocean model improvement and discuss new formulations that should better account for air-sea interactions.Plain Language Summary Western boundary currents (WBCs), such as the Gulf Stream and the Agulhas Current play a crucial role in global ocean circulation and in determining and stabilizing the Earth's climate. In the last decade, mesoscale air-sea interactions emerged as important in WBC dynamics. Recently, coupled models including the feedback of surface oceanic currents to the atmosphere revealed a process called eddy killing, which potentially corrects long-lasting biases in the representation of WBCs. In this study, using ocean-atmosphere coupled simulations of the Gulf Stream and Agulhas Current, we show that eddy killing reduces the interactions between eddies and mean flow. The influence of the eddies on the mean flow can be measured by the cascade of energy, and, in particular, the inverse cascade of energy. The reduction of inverse energy flux by eddy killing leads to realistic solutions and, in particular, to the observed stabilization of WBCs. Model and data fluxes are in good agreement when the same coarse grid is used for their computation, although in this case they are underestimated. We conclude that uncoupled models are no longer suitable for continuing our model improvement of ocean dynamics and discuss new formulations that should better account for air-sea interactions.

TI  - Assimilating Every-10-minute Himawari-8 Infrared Radiances to Improve Convective Predictability
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the predictability of sudden local severe weather is a grand challenge for numerical weather prediction. Recently, the capability of geostationary satellites to observe infrared radiances has been significantly improved, and it is expected that the "Big Data" from the new generation geostationary satellites could contribute to improving convective predictability. We examined the potential impacts of assimilating frequent infrared observations from a new generation geostationary satellite, Himawari-8, on convective predictability. We implemented the real-data experiment in which Himawari-8 all-sky moisture-sensitive infrared radiances of band 8 (6.2 mu m) and band 10 (7.3 mu m) were assimilated into the high-resolution (2 km) limited area model, Japan Meteorological Agency's Non-Hydrostatic Model, every 10 min by the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter. The frequent infrared observations from Himawari-8 improve the analysis and forecast of isolated convective cells and sudden local severe rainfall induced by weak large-scale forcing. The results imply that satellite data assimilation can contribute to better forecasting severe weather events in smaller spatiotemporal scales than the previous studies.

TI  - A Mapping Framework to Characterize Land Use in the Sudan-Sahel Region from Dense Stacks of Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a land cover and land use mapping framework specifically designed for agricultural systems of the Sudan-Sahel region. The mapping approach extracts information from inter- and intra-annual vegetation dynamics from dense stacks of Landsat 8 images. We applied this framework to create a 30 m spatial resolution land use map with a focus on agricultural landscapes of northern Nigeria for 2015. This map provides up-to-date information with a higher level of spatial and thematic detail resulting in a more precise characterization of agriculture in the region. The map reveals that agriculture is the main land use in the region. Arable land represents on average 52.5% of the area, higher than the reported national average for Nigeria (38.4%). Irrigated agriculture covers nearly 2.2% of the total area, reaching nearly 20% of the cultivated land when traditional floodplain agriculture systems are included, above the reported national average (0.63%). There is significant variability in land use within the region. Cultivated land in the northern section can reach values higher than 75%, most land suitable for agriculture is already under cultivation and there is limited land for future agricultural expansion. Marginal lands, not suitable for permanent agriculture, can reach 30% of the land at lower altitudes in the northeast and northwest. In contrast, the southern section presents lower land use intensity that results in a complex landscape that intertwines areas farms and larger patches of natural vegetation. This map improves the spatial detail of existing sources of LCLU information for the region and provides updated information of the current status of its agricultural landscapes. This study demonstrates the feasibility of multi temporal medium resolution remote sensing data to provide detailed and up-to-date information about agricultural systems in arid and sub arid landscapes of the Sahel region.

TI  - Intercomparison of Surface Albedo Retrievals from MISR, MODIS, CGLS Using Tower and Upscaled Tower Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is of crucial interest in land-climate interaction studies, since it is a key parameter that affects the Earth's radiation budget. The temporal and spatial variation of surface albedo can be retrieved from conventional satellite observations after a series of processes, including atmospheric correction to surface spectral bi-directional reflectance factor (BRF), bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) modelling using these BRFs, and, where required, narrow-to-broadband albedo conversions. This processing chain introduces errors that can be accumulated and then affect the accuracy of the retrieved albedo products. In this study, the albedo products derived from the multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR), moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS), based on the VEGETATION and now the PROBA-V sensors, are compared with albedometer and upscaled in situ measurements from 19 tower sites from the FLUXNET network, surface radiation budget network (SURFRAD) and Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) networks. The MISR sensor onboard the Terra satellite has 9 cameras at different view angles, which allows a near-simultaneous retrieval of surface albedo. Using a 16-day retrieval algorithm, the MODIS generates the daily albedo products (MCD43A) at a 500-m resolution. The CGLS albedo products are derived from the VEGETATION and PROBA-V, and updated every 10 days using a weighted 30-day window. We describe a newly developed method to derive the two types of albedo, which are directional hemispherical reflectance (DHR) and bi-hemispherical reflectance (BHR), directly from three tower-measured variables of shortwave radiation: downwelling, upwelling and diffuse shortwave radiation. In the validation process, the MISR, MODIS and CGLS-derived albedos (DHR and BHR) are first compared with tower measured albedos, using pixel-to-point analysis, between 2012 to 2016. The tower measured point albedos are then upscaled to coarse-resolution albedos, based on atmospherically corrected BRFs from high-resolution Earth observation (HR-EO) data, alongside MODIS BRDF climatology from a larger area. Then a pixel-to-pixel comparison is performed between DHR and BHR retrieved from coarse-resolution satellite observations and DHR and BHR upscaled from accurate tower measurements. The experimental results are presented on exploring the parameter space associated with land cover type, heterogeneous vs. homogeneous and instantaneous vs. time composite retrievals of surface albedo.

TI  - A Statistical and Spatial Analysis of Portuguese Forest Fires in Summer 2016 Considering Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A Data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest areas in Portugal are often affected by fires. The objective of this work was to analyze the most fire-affected areas in Portugal in the summer of 2016 for two municipalities considering data from Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2A MSI (prefire and postfire data). Different remote sensed data-derived indices, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), could be used to identify burnt areas and estimate the burn severity. In this work, NDVI was used to evaluate the area burned, and NBR was used to estimate the burn severity. The results showed that the NDVI decreased considerably after the fire event (2017 images), indicating a substantial decrease in the photosynthesis activity in these areas. The results also indicate that the NDVI differences (dNDVI) assumes the highest values in the burned areas. The results achieved for both sensors regarding the area burned presented differences from the field data no higher than 13.3% (for Sentinel 2A, less than 7.8%). We conclude that the area burned estimated using the Sentinel 2A data is more accurate, which can be justified by the higher spatial resolution of this data.

AB  - Having a reliable ocean carbon flux (f(CO2)) retrieval model is essential to monitoring the global carbon cycle and to evaluating the climate change. Remote sensing techniques provide alternatives for f(CO2) retrieval with its advantages of wide area surveys and real-time monitoring. In the present study, a semianalytical f(CO2) estimation model was developed based on remote sensing data and in situ measurements in the Chinese Bohai Sea. The used model performed well (R-2 = 0.84) in deriving f(CO2) based on the collected remotely sensed dataset, including sea surface temperature, estimated sea surface salinity, wind speed, Chl-a concentration. The results showed that the distribution of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (p(CO2)) and f(CO2) varied spatially and temporally during the 12 months in 2009. The spatial fluctuations of p(CO2) and f(CO2) in Bohai Sea in summer and autumn were more obvious than that in Spring and Winter. The highest values of p(CO2) and f(CO2) generally appeared in coastal regions. Moreover, the average f(CO2) value of the 12 months showed that the Bohai Sea performed as a weak carbon source in 2009. The results provided technical and data support for carbon management and climate negotiation in the Bohai Sea.

TI  - Estimation of PMx Concentrations from Landsat 8 OLI Images Based on a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of PMx (incl. PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations using satellite observations is of great significance for detecting environmental issues in many urban areas of north China. Recently, aerosol optical depth (AOD) data have been being used to estimate the PMx concentrations by implementing linear and/or nonlinear regression analysis methods. However, a lot of relevant research based on AOD published so far have demonstrated some limitations in estimating the spatial distribution of PMx concentrations with respect to estimation accuracy and spatial resolution. In this research, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform is employed to obtain the band reflectance (BR) data of a large number of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) remote sensing images. Combined with the meteorological, time parameter and the latitude and longitude zone (LLZ) method proposed in this article, a new BR (band reflectance)-PMx (incl. PM10 and PM2.5) model based on a multilayer perceptron neural network is constructed for the estimation of PMx concentrations directly from Landsat 8 OLI remote sensing images. This research used Beijing, China as the test area and the conducted experiments demonstrated that the BR-PMx model achieved satisfactory performances for the PMx-concentration estimations. The coefficient of determination (R-2) of the BR-PM2.5 and BR-PM10 models reached 0.795 and 0.773, respectively, and the root mean square error (RMSE) reached 20.09 mu g/m(3) and 31.27 mu g/m(3). Meanwhile, the estimation results have been compared with the results calculated by Kriging interpolation at the same time point, and the spatial distribution is consistent. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed BR-PMx model provides a new promising method for acquiring accurate PMx concentrations for various cities of China.

TI  - Effects of Land Use Dynamics on Hydrological Response of Watershed: a Case Study of Chittar Watershed, Vamanapuram River Basin, Thiruvananthapuram District, Kerala, India
T2  - WATER CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Watersheds in the tropical regions of India are vulnerable to the effects of land use/land cover (LULC) change, transpiration and evaporation on groundwater resources. Understanding these changes is important to delineate the impacts on the hydrological cycle and thus helps to strengthen the efficiency of the water management system. A significant change in LULC and evapotranspiration has been observed in the Chittar watershed over the years. The present study involves the assessment of LULC changes during 1967-2001 and 2001-2015. The MODIS MOD 16 A3 data products were used to study evapotranspiration during the period. The groundwater level data of Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) have been used to study the water level changes from 2001 to 2015. The results of the LULC changes indicate that the natural vegetation is decreased significantly from 1967 to 2015. The aerial coverage of natural vegetation was 54% in 1967 which was reduced to 49% in 2001 and 30% in 2015. The most significant land use category is eucalyptus plantation which is decreased from 1967 (12 km(2)) to 2001 (9 km(2)). After the year 2011, eucalyptus plantations are converted into acacia plantations. The average annual evapotranspiration of the study area is 917 mm/year during the years 2001 to 2015. The overall evapotranspiration showed a decreasing trend with marked interannual fluctuations. Coming to the groundwater, the upstream of the study area exhibited shallow groundwater level (6.5 to < 6 m below ground level) while the other parts exhibited comparatively deeper groundwater level (> 7.5). From 2001 to 2009, the groundwater level was significantly fluctuated; however, the fluctuation was minimal after 2009. To conclude, the study revealed that the LULC changes in the Chittar watershed have a pivotal role in the observed changes in evapotranspiration. The results reiterated that the changes in evapotranspiration (ET) have a strong bearing on the groundwater potential of the area.

TI  - Comparison of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 imagery for forest variable prediction in boreal region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the performance of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data for forest variable prediction in the boreal forest of Southern Finland. We defined twelve modelling setups to train multivariable prediction models with either multilayer perceptron (MLP) or regression tree models with the brute force forward selection method. The reference data consisted of 739 circular field plots that had been collected by the Finnish Forest Centre concurrently with the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 acquisitions. The input data were divided into training, validation and test sets of equal sizes for 100 iterations in each modelling setup. The predicted forest variables were stem volume (V), stem diameter (D), tree height (H) and basal area (G), and their species-wise components for pine (Pine), spruce (Spr) and broadleaved (BL) trees. We recorded the performance figures and the best predictive image bands for each modelling setup.The best average performance over the 100 modelling iterations was obtained using all Sentinel-2 bands. The plot-level relative root mean square errors (RMSE%) of the field observed mean were 38.4% for average stem diameter, 42.5% for stem basal area/ha, 30.4% for average tree height, and 59.3% for growing stock volume/ha with variables including all tree species. The corresponding best figures with all Landsat 8 bands were RMSE % = 44.6%, 50.2%, 36.6% and 72.2%, respectively. The Sentinel-2 outperformed Landsat 8 also when using near-equivalent image bands and Sentinel-2 data down-sampled to 30 m pixel resolution. The relative systematic error (bias%) did not show any significant differences between Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data: the average of the absolute value of bias% was 0.8% for Sentinel-2 and 1.2% for Landsat 8. The best predictive Sentinel-2 image band was the red-edge 1 (B05_RE1), when variable totals including all species were estimated. The short-wave infrared bands (B11_SWIR1 & B12_SWIR2) and the visible green band (B03_Green) were also among the best predictors. The median number of predictors in the best performing models was 4-6 for the Sentinel-2 and 4-5 for the Landsat 8 models, respectively.We conclude that Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data can be recommended as the principal Earth observation data source in forest resources assessment.

TI  - Assessing spring phenology of a temperate woodland: A multiscale comparison of ground, unmanned aerial vehicle and Landsat satellite observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of forest phenology in a cost-effective manner, at a fine spatial scale and over relatively large areas remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) appear to be a potential new platform for forest phenology monitoring. This article assesses the potential of UAV data to track the temporal dynamics of spring phenology, from the individual tree to woodland scale, and cross-compare UAV results against ground and satellite observations, in order to better understand characteristics of UAV data and assess potential for use in validation of satellite-derived phenology. A time series of UAV data (5 cm spatial resolution, similar to 7 day temporal resolution) were acquired in tandem with an intensive ground campaign during the spring season of 2015 across a 15 ha mixed woodland. Phenophase transition dates were estimated at an individual tree-level using UAV time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) and validated against visual observations of tree phenology. UAV-derived start of season dates could be predicted with an accuracy of < 1 week. The analysis was scaled to a plot level, where ground (visual assessment and understorey development), UAV and Landsat metrics were compared, indicating UAV data is effective for tracking canopy phenology, as opposed to ecosystem dynamics detected by satellites. The UAV data were used to automatically map phonological events for individual trees across the whole woodland, demonstrating that contrasting canopy phenological events can occur within the extent of a single Landsat pixel. This, and a large temporal gap in the Landsat series, accounted for the poor relationships found between UAV- and Landsat-derived phenometrics (R-2 < 0.50) in this study. An opportunity is now available to track very fine scale land surface changes over contiguous vegetation communities, providing information which could improve characterization of vegetation phonology at multiple scales.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background In 2017, Australia experienced record influenza notifications. Two surveillance programs combined to summarize the epidemiology of hospitalized influenza in children and report on vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the context of a limited nationally funded vaccination program.Methods Subjects were prospectively recruited (April-October 2017). Case patients were children aged 16 years admitted to 11 hospitals with an acute respiratory illness and laboratory-confirmed influenza. Controls were hospitalized with acute respiratory illness and tested negative for influenza. VE estimates were calculated using the test-negative design.Results A total of 1268 children were hospitalized with influenza: 31.5% were <2 years old, 8.3% were indigenous, and 45.1% had comorbid conditions predisposing to severe influenza. Influenza B was detected in 34.1% with influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 detected in 47.2% and 52.8% of subtyped influenza A specimens. The median length of stay was 3 days (interquartile range, 1-5), 14.5% were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 15.9% received oseltamivir. Four in-hospital deaths occurred (0.3%): one was considered influenza associated. Only 17.1% of test-negative-controls were vaccinated. The VE of inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine for preventing hospitalized influenza was estimated at 30.3% (95% confidence interval, 2.6%-50.2%).Conclusions Significant influenza-associated morbidity was observed in 2017 in Australia. Most hospitalized children had no comorbid conditions. Vaccine coverage and antiviral use was inadequate. Influenza vaccine was protective in 2017, yet VE was lower than previous seasons. Multiple Australian states have introduced funded preschool vaccination programs in 2018. Additional efforts to promote vaccination and monitor effectiveness are required.Significant influenza-associated pediatric morbidity was observed in Australia in 2017. This has prompted multiple Australian states to introduce funded preschool vaccination in 2018. In 2017, inactivated quadrivalent vaccine was protective but with lower effectiveness than observed in previous seasons.

TI  - Angular variations of brightness surface temperatures derived from dual-view measurements of the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer using a new single band atmospheric correction method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface temperatures derived from remote sensing data over heterogeneous, non-isothermal land surfaces depend on the viewing and solar angles mainly due to variations in sunlit and shaded fractions of the different elements in the field of view. The near-simultaneous dual-view capability of the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) can be used to estimate differences in brightness surface temperatures (BSTs) between the nadir (satellite zenith angle of 0 degrees-21.7 degrees) and forward views (53 degrees-55.6 degrees) in the 11 and 12 mu M bands. BST is defined as the black-body temperature corresponding to the radiance at surface level (that is, corrected for atmospheric absorption and emission). We developed an automated, pixel-by-pixel atmospheric correction method to obtain the BST for the 11 and 12 pm bands at nadir and forward views. It uses atmospheric profiles from the NCEP reanalysis product provided at 1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial resolution every 6 h, the MODTRAN 5 radiative transfer model, and a digital elevation model with spatial resolution of 1 km. The method provides the atmospheric transmittance and upwelling radiance at the AATSR resolution (1 km) for the two bands and views, taking into account the geographical coordinates, altitude and zenith observation angle of each pixel, and the AATSR overpass time. The method was applied to eight daytime and nighttime AATSR scenes over the Iberian Peninsula on the four seasons, for which the nadir-forward BST differences were obtained. For sea surfaces, the angular BST difference was uniform and independent on the time and season with an average about +0.7 K. This is expected since the sea surface is homogeneous and flat, the only angular effect being due to the known angular variation of emissivity. Nadir-forward BST differences were usually positive for daytime data over land surfaces, since AATSR observes from the North so there is a larger fraction of sunlit elements in the nadir view in the northern hemisphere. We found a clear seasonal dependence as expected, the largest (smallest) angular BST differences being obtained in summer (winter). The spatial variability of the daytime angular BST differences over land was also highest (lowest) in summer (winter). For the nighttime data, the angular variation was much smaller and uniform for all seasons. In order to analyze the daytime angular BST differences over land, we used concurrent Leaf Area Index (LAI) data obtained from the MODIS product MOD15A2. For a given date, the largest differences were found for surfaces with LAI values ranging from 0.5 to 2, due to the large change in the proportions of sunlit and shaded elements observed by the two views. For such cases in summer, differences up to 8 K were found, with average values of 4 K and high variability. For LAI values larger than 3, the angular differences decreased to about 2 K and were more uniform. We also found a positive correlation between the angular BST difference and the nadir BST.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of High-Resolution Soil Moisture Simulations from the Soil, Vegetation, and Snow (SVS) Land Surface Model Using SAR Imagery Over Bare Soil
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a key variable in Earth systems, controlling the exchange of water and energy between land and atmosphere. Thus, understanding its spatiotemporal distribution and variability is important. Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) has developed a new land surface parameterization, named the Soil, Vegetation, and Snow (SVS) scheme. The SVS land surface scheme features sophisticated parameterizations of hydrological processes, including water transport through the soil. It has been shown to provide more accurate simulations of the temporal and spatial distribution of soil moisture compared to the current operational land surface scheme. Simulation of high resolution soil moisture at the field scale remains a challenge. In this study, we simulate soil moisture maps at a spatial resolution of 100 m using the SVS land surface scheme over an experimental site located in Manitoba, Canada. Hourly high resolution soil moisture maps were produced between May and November 2015. Simulated soil moisture values were compared with estimated soil moisture values using a hybrid retrieval algorithm developed at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) for soil moisture estimation using RADARSAT-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. Statistical analysis of the results showed an overall promising performance of the SVS land surface scheme in simulating soil moisture values at high resolution scale. Investigation of the SVS output was conducted both independently of the soil texture, and as a function of the soil texture. The SVS model tends to perform slightly better over coarser textured soils (sandy loam, fine sand) than finer textured soils (clays). Correlation values of the simulated SVS soil moisture and the retrieved SAR soil moisture lie between 0.753-0.860 over sand and 0.676-0.865 over clay, with goodness of fit values between 0.567-0.739 and 0.457-0.748, respectively. The Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) values range between 0.058-0.062 over sand and 0.055-0.113 over clay, with a maximum absolute bias of 0.049 and 0.094 over sand and clay, respectively. The unbiased RMSD values lie between 0.038-0.057 over sand and 0.039-0.064 over clay. Furthermore, results show an Index of Agreement (IA) between the simulated and the derived soil moisture always higher than 0.90.

TI  - Coastal and inland water pixels extraction algorithm (WiPE) from spectral shape analysis and HSV transformation applied to Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of water pixels over natural water bodies is a prerequisite step prior to applying algorithms dedicated to the estimation of bio-optical properties of surface waters from remote sensing observations. For visible remote sensing sensors, clouds affect the quantity and quality of the observations, directly by hiding part of the scene and indirectly by their shadows. A certain level of confusion could occur for detection of clouds over turbid (i.e. bright) waters and for detection of their shadows over any kind of surface water. Some algorithms exist but their performance is not satisfactory, especially over turbid waters where cloud-free pixels are sometimes classified as cloud or land, leading to a loss of data. This is particularly important for medium spatial resolution observations such as those performed by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor on Landsat-8 or the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2 (a and b). In the frame of this study, we developed a two-step algorithm for the extraction of water pixels (referred to as WiPE) for these medium spatial resolution sensors. In contrast to other approaches based on the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, this algorithm uses the Rayleigh-corrected TOA reflectance (rho(rc)(lambda)) as input parameter allowing the spectral signature of each object to be better characterized. The first step, based on the rho(rc)(lambda) spectral shape analysis of each object, allows water pixels to be discriminated from cloud, vegetation, barren land, and constructions pixels. The second step, in which the rho(rc)(lambda) spectra are transferred into the Hue-Saturation-Value space, greatly improves the detection of cloud shadow over waters. This second step, based on the processing of the whole image, does not require any knowledge on the location and altitude of clouds. Thin clouds are identified during the two steps of the algorithm. This algorithm has been successfully tested over a broad range of environments. WiPE, specifically designed for the extraction of water pixels, generally shows better performance over turbid waters than the standard algorithm developed for Landsat imagery (Fmask). This is explained by the fact that Fmask does not specifically focus on the detection of water pixels, but on the masking of cloud, cloud shadow, and snow over land and water.

TI  - Monitoring turbidity from above: Deploying small unoccupied aerial vehicles to image in-stream turbidity
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Small unoccupied aerial systems (sUASs) are increasingly applied to study hydrologic processes and water quality. Here, we evaluate a novel application of sUAS to stream turbidity monitoring, with the goal of extending analyses implemented with satellite remote sensing to enable high resolution, rapid collection of turbidity imagery along smaller waterbodies. To accomplish this, we collected multispectral imagery using two sUAS platforms under a range of environmental conditions along a local creek in Syracuse, NY. In addition, we collected in situ turbidity observations immediately after each flight along several transects along the creek, as well as within a clear plume created by a natural spring entering the main channel of the creek. The in situ turbidity values were compared with the mean and standard deviation of several single-band and multiband indices extracted along similar transects from the sUAS flights. On the basis of data collected across several flights, we found optical metrics obtained from multispectral imagery correlated well with in situ turbidity measurements. Though many optical metrics yielded strong relationships considering only values within the main channel, values associated with the red band were strongly related to turbidity estimates from the main channel as well as lower turbidity values observed in the spring plume. Although there are still limitations of this approach associated with variable field conditions, results from this proof of concept analysis show that sUASs offer a promising avenue for cost-effective turbidity monitoring.

TI  - An optimized two source energy balance model based on complementary concept and canopy conductance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we revised a two source energy balance model (G(c)-TSEB) that is based on canopy conductance and soil moisture in evapotranspiration (ET) estimation. We estimate soil evaporation (E) using the complementary concept and soil surface temperature, therefore, the revised G(c)-TSEB requires no soil moisture as input. We tested G(c)-TSEB at 10 flux sites under various land cover and climate conditions. The flux-calibrated G(c)-TSEB performed well in ET predictions, with determinant coefficients (R-2) larger than 0.9 at most of the sites. The modeled transpiration was highly correlated with the Gross Primary Production, indicating the usefulness of the model in ET partitioning. More importantly, G(c)-TSEB can be calibrated against the land surface temperature (LST), which is operationally available using remote sensing technique. Overall, daily ET that was predicted by the LST-calibrated G(c)-TSEB generally matched the trends of the ET measurements at most of the sites, and R-2 range from 0.63 to 0.93, with a median of 0.80, at all sites. Transpiration estimation was highly consistent with the simulations from the flux-calibrated model. Moreover, in vegetated surfaces, soil evaporation was estimated reasonably well using the LST-calibrated G(c)-TSEB. However, positive biases are prevalent when vegetated fraction is smaller than 0.2, especially in cold regions because of the dramatic differences in evaporation process between summer and winter. To improve model performances, calibrating G(c)-TSEB model in separated periods and using prior knowledge as constraints proved to be useful.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node nonvisualization after intratumoral radioisotope tracer injection in breast cancer is not associated with a higher nodal metastasis rate or worse outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy does not always visualize a sentinel lymph node (SLN). The study aim was to investigate whether persistent nonvisualization after additional single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT or a second radiotracer injection in breast cancer patients is associated with nodal metastases or worse outcome due to potential understaging and consequently undertreatment. Methods Altogether 2042 consecutive SLN procedures were evaluated. All patients were clinically node-negative, underwent axillary ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration cytology (US/FNAC) of suspicious nodes. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed at 3 to 4 hours after intratumoral injection of 99mTc-nanocolloid. SPECT/CT or a reinjection was performed when initial lymphoscintigraphy showed nonvisualization. Results Persistent nonvisualization was seen in 170 of 2042 procedures (8.3%). The nodal metastasis rate was 16.0% vs 18.0% for procedures with nonvisualization vs SLN visualization, respectively (P = 0.593). The regional recurrence rate of tumor-negative SLN biopsy procedures was equal between the nonvisualization (0.7%, 11 of 1535) vs visualization (0.7%, 1 of 144) group. Median follow-up was 48 months. Distant-metastasis free interval and overall survival was not significantly different between both groups (P = 0.164 and 0.208, respectively). Conclusions Persistent nonvisualization after lymphoscintigraphy plus SPECT/CT or radiotracer reinjection is not associated with a higher nodal metastasis rate or worse long term outcome when preoperative US/FNAC is performed.

TI  - On the remote estimation of <i>Ulva prolifera</i> areal coverage and biomass
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the outbreak of a large-scale Ulva prolifera bloom in the Yellow Sea during the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Competition in summer 2008, Ulva blooms have been a marine hazard every summer. Accurate and timely information on Ulva areal coverage and biomass is of critical importance for governmental responses, decision making, and field studies. Previous studies have shown that satellite remote sensing is the most effective method for this purpose, yet Ulva areal coverage has been estimated in different ways with significantly different results. The objective of this paper is to determine the lower and upper bounds (T-0 and T-1) of algae-containing pixels in Floating Algae Index images with an objective method that accurately estimates the Ulva areal coverage in individual images, and then converts coverage to biomass using a previously established conversion equation. First, a seawater background image, FAI(sw), is constructed to determine T-0, which varies for different algae patches. Then, T-1 is determined from water tank and in situ measurements as well as radiative transfer simulations to account for different sensor configurations, solar/viewing geometry, and atmospheric conditions. Such determined T-1 for MODIS 250-m resolution data is validated using concurrent and collocated 2-m resolution WorldView-2 data. Finally, Ulva areal coverage derived from MODIS data using this method are compared with those from the high-resolution data (OLI/Landsat, WFV/GaoFen-1), with a mean relative difference of 9.6%. Furthermore, an analysis of 17 same-day MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua image pairs shows that large viewing angles, atmospheric turbidity, and sunglint can lead to an underestimation of Ulva coverage of up to 45% under extreme conditions.

TI  - UAV based soil salinity assessment of cropland
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased soil salinity is a significant agricultural problem that decreases yields for common agricultural crops. Its dynamics require cost and labour effective measurement techniques and widely acknowledged methods are not present yet. We investigated the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing to measure salt stress in quinoa plants. Three different UAV sensors were used: a WIRIS thermal camera, a Rikola hyperspectral camera and a Riegl VUX-SYS Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanner. Several vegetation indices, canopy temperature and LiDAR measured plant height were derived from the remote sensing data and their relation with ground measured parameters like salt treatment, stomatal conductance and actual plant height is analysed. The results show that widely used multispectral vegetation indices are not efficient in discriminating between salt affected and control quinoa plants. The hyperspectral Physiological Reflectance Index (PRI) performed best and showed a clear distinction between salt affected and treated plants. This distinction is also visible for LiDAR measured plant height, where salt treated plants were on average 10 cm shorter than control plants. Canopy temperature was significantly affected, though detection of this required an additional step in analysis - Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) clustering. This step assured temperature comparison for equally vegetated pixels. Data combination of all three sensors in a Multiple Linear Regression model increased the prediction power and for the whole dataset R-2 reached 0.46, with some subgroups reaching an R-2 of 0.64. We conclude that UAV borne remote sensing is useful for measuring salt stress in plants and a combination of multiple measurement techniques is advised to increase the accuracy.

TI  - EcoAnthromes of Alberta: An example of disturbance-informed ecological regionalization using remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Humans influence ecosystems on magnitudes that often exceed that of natural forces such as climate and geology; however, frameworks rarely include anthropogenic disturbance when delineating unique ecological regions. A critical step toward understanding, managing and monitoring human-altered ecosystems is to incorporate disturbance into ecological regionalizations. Furthermore, quantitative regionalization approaches are desirable to provide cost-effective, repeatable and statistically sound stratification for environmental monitoring. We applied a two-stage multivariate clustering technique to identify 'EcoAnthromes' across a large area - the province of Alberta, Canada - at 30 m spatial resolution, and using primarily remotely sensed inputs. The EcoAnthrome clusters represent regions with unique ecological characteristics based on a combination of natural ecological potential (e.g., climatic and edaphic factors) and disturbance, both natural and anthropogenic. Compared to existing expert-derived Natural Subregions in Alberta, the model-based EcoAnthromes showed greater class separation and explained more variance for an assortment of variables related to land cover, disturbance and species intactness. The EcoAnthromes successfully separated important ecological regions that are defined by complex assemblages of topography, climate and disturbance, such as gravel-bed river valleys, boreal forests, grasslands, post-fire recovery areas and highly disturbed agricultural, industrial and urban landscapes. In addition to presenting a flexible method for EcoAnthrome regionalization, we group and describe the EcoAnthromes created for Alberta and discuss how they can complement expert-derived regionalizations to aid in environmental management efforts, such as species recovery planning and monitoring for threatened species.

TI  - Toward building a transparent statistical model for improving crop yield prediction: Modeling rainfed corn in the U.S
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Statistical crop models have been a major tool in identifying critical drivers of crop yield, forecasting short-term crop yield, and assessing long-term climate change impacts on agricultural productivity. However, few studies focus specifically on fundamental issues encountered in developing a high-performance statistical crop model for yield prediction. Such issues include: how to select predictors and fitting functions, how to effectively address the spatiotemporal scale issue, weather it is beneficial to include satellite data as explanatory variables, and how to reconcile different model evaluation procedures. In this study, we present our statistical modeling practices for predicting rainfed corn yield in the Midwest U.S. and address the aforementioned issues through comprehensive diagnostic analysis. Our results show that vapor pressure deficit and precipitation at a monthly scale, in spline form with customized knots, define the "Best Climate-only" model among alternative climate variables (e.g., air temperature) and fitting functions (e.g., linear or polynomial), with an out-of-sample (leave-one-year out) median R-2 of 0.79 and RMSE of 1.04 t/ha (16.6 bu/acre) from 2003 to 2016. Satellite variables, such as MODIS land surface temperature and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), when used as predictors alone, reduce the model's RMSE to 0.93 t/ha (14.8 bu/acre). Adding satellite variables (i.e., EVI in polynomial form) to the "Best Climate-only" model gives the "Best Climate + EVI" model, which has the highest prediction performance of this study, with a median R-2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.90 t/ha (14.3 bu/acre). Such a model trained using all data (so-called "global model") in most cases leads to better predictions than the state-specific trained models. However, the global model's prediction performance exhibits considerable regional and interannual variations. The regional-varying performance is related to states' spatiotemporal variability in yield, where states with larger spatial yield variability show higher R-2, and states with smaller temporal yield variability show lower RMSE. Interannual variations in prediction performance are linked to yield variability and degree of wetness, with higher R-2 in years with larger yield variability but increasingly larger RMSE toward wetter years and extreme dry years. These identified spatial and temporal variations of model's performance, together with inconsistent evaluation practices undermine the comparability between statistical modeling studies. Alleviating such comparability issues requires more transparency and open data practices. The statistical model presented in this study provides a benchmark for further development and can be applied to future research related to yield prediction or assessment of climate change impact.

TI  - Satellite-derived particulate organic carbon flux in the Changjiang River through different stages of the Three Gorges Dam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest Asian river and fourth world's largest river by water flow, the Changjiang River transports a considerable amount of terrigenous particulate organic carbon (POC) into ocean, which has experienced significant pressure from human activities. We conducted monthly sampling (from May 2015 to May 2016) at Datong, the most downstream non-tidal hydrological station along the Changjiang River. To monitor long-term POC variations, we developed a two-step POC algorithm for Landsat satellite data and calculated monthly POC flux during 2000-2016. Monthly POC flux ranged from a minimum of 1.4 x 10(4) t C in February 2016 to a maximum of 52.04 x 10(4) t C in May 2002, with a mean of 13.04 x 10(4) t C/month. At Datong, monthly POC flux was positively exponentially related to water flow (N = 118, R = 0.69, p < 0.01). In the wet season (May to October) with high water flow, a large amount of terrigenous POC was flushed into the Changjiang River. After the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), both POC concentration (R = 0.46, p < 0.01) and POC flux (R = 0.33, p < 0.01) significantly exponentially decreased during 2000-2016. After 2011 with regular operation of the TGD, POC transport at Datong showed relative stability and its seasonal difference became smaller. POC concentration from the TGD to Datong in the Changjiang mainstream (similar to 1000 km) was also derived from Landsat data, which was spatially varied with water flow, slope gradient, and watercourse width. This study improved our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of POC transport in the Changjiang mainstream, especially the influences of the TGD construction.

TI  - Satellite estimation of particulate organic carbon flux from Changjiang River to the estuary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers link land and ocean ecosystems, the two largest active carbon reservoirs in the world, and transport tremendous amounts of particulate organic carbon (POC) into marginal seas annually. Due to high spatiotemporal variations, estimations of riverine POC flux into the sea can be relatively inexact when based on field measurement only. In this study, remote sensing algorithms of riverine POC flux through the Xuliujing hydrological station in the Changjiang River Estuary (CRE) were developed using satellite data with hourly resolution from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI). Based on data collected during four seasonal cruises in the CRE from 2014 to 2016, POC concentration showed a significant linear relationship to total suspended matter (TSM) (N = 426, R-2 = 0.97, p < 0.01). Thus, surface POC concentration was calculated by satellite-derived TSM. From the in-situ data, the vertical POC concentration profile at Xuliujing showed an exponentially increasing curve (p < 0.01), but a linear decrease (p < 0.01) for the water flow profile from the surface to the bottom. Combining the GOCI-derived surface POC concentration and vertical profiles of POC and water flow, we estimated monthly riverine POC fluxes to the CRE. Results showed that monthly POC flux at Xuliujing (0.071 +/- 0.022 Tg C) was 22.64% higher, on average, than the commonly used value at the non-tidal Datong hydrological station. Moreover, under human activity pressures, the influences of POC input from the Changjiang River on POC concentration at Xuliujing have weakened in recent years. Monthly and diurnal POC variations in the CRE were mainly impacted by wind speed and tidal processes, respectively. Thus, satellite monitoring with high spatiotemporal resolution has great significance for accurately estimating riverine POC flux to estuary.

TI  - Aeolian accumulation: An alternative origin of laterite on the Deccan Plateau, India
T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Laterite is ubiquitous in India and has been extensively studied. However, it is still controversial with respect to its origin, definition, classification, and implications in paleoclimate, tectonic history and topography evolution. Of those, the origin of laterite, either in situ weathering of protoliths or weathering of allochthonous input, is the most critical to address. The ca. 25-m-thick laterite (duricrust) capping the Deccan Plateau is conventionally hypothesized to derive from in situ weathering of the topmost basalt. However, this thick laterite lacks upward progressive weathering which is characteristic of lateritic profile. Instead, it displays: 1) homogeneity in weathering intensity through the duricrust; 2) a clear unconformable contact of laterite with red clay, which together suggests that this thick laterite is genetically unrelated to in situ weathering of the topmost basalt. Lines of evidence in mineralogy, granularity, and geochemistry proved the disconnection between this laterite and basalt, and in contrast, indicated its correlation to aeolian accumulation. In this study the laterite together with the red clay was proposed to derive from aeolian dust accumulation and weathering since 65 Ma within context of Indian plate drifting across the equator from southern to northern hemisphere.

TI  - Improving satellite retrieved night-time infrared sea surface temperatures in aerosol contaminated regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite retrievals of sea surface temperature (SST) have become necessary for many applications. Satellite infrared imaging radiometers passively measure the radiance emitted and reflected by the surface of the Earth and atmosphere. Tropospheric aerosols increase the signal attenuation at the satellite height, degrading the accuracy of SST retrievals. In this study to assess the infrared radiative effects of aerosols on satellite-derived skin SSTs (SSTskin), MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) SSTskin retrievals are compared with quality-controlled, collocated SSTskin, measurements from the Marine-Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (M-AERI) deployed on research cruises during the Aerosols and Ocean Science Expeditions (AEROSE), and sub-surface temperatures measured by thermistors on drifting buoys. In this region, SSTskin retrievals from the MODIS on the Aqua satellite are generally much cooler than the in-situ measurements. In the Saharan outflow area between 90 W to 90 degrees E and 20 degrees S to 35 degrees N where aerosol optical depths may be > 0.5, satellite SSTskin are often > 1 K cooler than the in situ data. The goal of this research is to determine the characteristics of aerosol effects on satellite retrieved infrared SST, and to derive formulae for improving accuracies of infrared-derived SSTs in aerosol-contaminated regions. A new method to derive a night-time Dust-induced SST Difference Index (DSDI) algorithm based on simulated brightness temperatures and Principal component (PC) analysis (PCA) at infrared wavelengths of 3.8, 8.9, 10.8 and 12.0 mu m, was developed using radiative transfer simulations. The satellite SSTskin biases and standard deviations, derive by comparisons with coincident and collocated surface and in situ measurements, are reduced by 0.263 K and 0.166 K after the DSDI correction. This method can also improve the fraction of useful data available compared to the usual approach of discarding measurements identified as being contaminated by the effects of aerosols.

TI  - Modeling multi-decadal mangrove leaf area index in response to drought along the semi-arid southern coasts of Iran
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf Area Index (LAI, as an indiator of the health) of the mangrove ecosystems on the northern coasts of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman was measured in the field and modeled in response to observed (1986-2017) and predicted (2018-2100) drought occurrences (quantified using the Standardized Precipitation Index [Sil]). The relationship of LAI with the normalized difference vegetation index (NINO obtained from satellite images was quantified, the LA! between 1986 and 2017 retrospectively estimated, and a relationship between lAl and SPI developed for the same period. Long-term climate data were used as input in the RCP8.5 climate change scenario to reconstruct I ecent and forecast future drought intensities. Both the NEVI and the SPI were strongly related with the LAI, indicating that realistic LAI values were derived from historic satellite data to portray annual changes of LAI in response to changes in SPI. Our findings show that projected future drought intensities modeled by the RCP8.5 scenario increase more and future LAIs decreased more on the coasts of the Gulf of Oman than the coasts of the Persian Gulf in the coming decades. The year 1998 was the most significant change-point for mean annual rainfall amounts and thought occurrences as well as for lAls and at no time between 1998 and 2017 or between 2018 and 2100 are SP! and values expected to return to pre-1998 values. and SPI are projected W decline sharply around 2030, reach their lowest levels between 2040 and 2070, and increase and stabilize during the late decades of the 21st century at values similar to the present time. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive picture of the responses of mangroves to fluctuating future drought conditions, facilitating the development of management plans for these vulnerable habitats in the face of future climate change.

TI  - Global Typhoid Fever Incidence: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Contemporary incidence estimates of typhoid fever are needed to guide policy decisions and control measures and to improve future epidemiological studies.Methods We systematically reviewed 3 databases (Ovid Medline, PubMed, and Scopus) without restriction on age, country, language, or time for studies reporting the incidence of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever. Outbreak, travel-associated, and passive government surveillance reports were excluded. We performed a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate estimates of pooled incidence, stratifying by studies that reported the incidence of typhoid fever and those that estimated incidence by using multipliers.Results Thirty-three studies were included in the analysis. There were 26 study sites from 16 countries reporting typhoid cases from population-based incidence studies, and 17 sites in 9 countries used multipliers to account for underascertainment in sentinel surveillance data. We identified Africa and Asia as regions with studies showing high typhoid incidence while noting considerable variation of typhoid incidence in time and place, including in consecutive years at the same location. Overall, more recent studies reported lower typhoid incidence compared to years prior to 2000. We identified variation in the criteria for collecting a blood culture, and among multiplier studies we identified a lack of a standardization for the types of multipliers being used to estimate incidence.Conclusions Typhoid fever incidence remains high at many sites. Additional and more accurate typhoid incidence studies are needed to support country decisions about typhoid conjugate vaccine adoption. Standardization of multiplier types applied in multiplier studies is recommended.Despite risk for bias, contemporary studies of typhoid fever report lower incidence than older studies. The highest-incidence sites were in Asia, followed by Africa. Data are needed from a number of areas, especially Oceania. Standardization of multiplier studies would assist with interpretation.

TI  - Contribution of meteorological factors to particulate pollution during winters in Beijing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Associated with its modernization, Beijing has experienced significant fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution, especially in winter. In 2016, severe PM2.5 pollution (PM2.5 > 250 mu g/m(3)) lasted over 6 days and affected over 23 million people. A major challenge in dealing with this issue is the uncertainty regarding the influence of individual meteorological factors to the overall PM2.5 concentration in Beijing. Thus, applying an empirical regression method to long-term ground-based PM2.5 data and meteorological sounding measurements, we attempted to analyze the influence of individual meteorological factors on PM2.5 pollution during winters in Beijing. We found that horizontal dilution and vertical aggregation plays a major role in PM2.5 pollution during the winter of 2016. The impact of horizontal wind on PM2.5 concentration in Beijing was mainly from its dilution, the dilution of northerly wind contributed 27.8% in 2016, far below its contribution in 2015 (32.2%). The contribution from the growing vertical aggregation observed in 2016 was mainly the result of both the lower height of the planetary boundary layer and the greater depth of the temperature inversion. The dilution of the planetary boundary layer height contributed 9.8% to PM2.5 pollution in 2016, 5.4% lower than that in 2017. Compared with the temperature difference of the inversion layer, the temperature inversion depth better reflects the aggregated impact of temperature inversions to PM2.5, which was 10.9% in 2015, and the ratio rose to 14.3% in 2016. Relative humidity is also an important impacting factor, which contributed 41.0%, far higher than the ratio in 2017 (26.7%). Such results imply that we should focus on not only local emission control, but also horizontal atmospheric transport and meteorological conditions in order to provide a more accurate analysis of pollution mechanisms, conductive to air pollution governance in Beijing.

TI  - A Marxist Sherlock Holmes: Ito Ken and the Proletarian Detective in 1920s Shanghai
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL-JAPAN FOCUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ito Ken (1895-1945), a proletarian writer, stated in 1930 that his collection of short stories Shanhai Yawa (Shanghai Night Stories) was intended to be a "detective and proletarian like popular novel." But how can a proletarian writer with a Marxist worldview change an apolitical genre such as the detective story into a weapon of proletarian literature? Could a Marxist detective reveal the crimes of capital? Examining Ito's journalistic articles and fiction within the context of mass media and detective fiction, I aim to show how Ito Ken tried to rework the detective genre into a form of proletarian literature.

TI  - Quantifying structural diversity to better estimate change at mountain forest margins
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global environmental changes are driving shifts in forest distribution across the globe with significant implications for biodiversity and ecosystem function. At the upper elevational limit of forest distribution, patterns of forest advance and stasis can be highly spatially variable. Reliable estimations of forest distribution shifts require assessments of forest change to account for variation in treeline advance across entire mountain ranges. Multispectral satellite remote sensing is well suited to this purpose and is particularly valuable in regions where the scope of field campaigns is restricted. However, there is little understanding of how much information about forest structure at the mountain treeline can be derived from multispectral remote sensing data. Here we combine field data from a structurally diverse treeline ecotone in the Central Mountain Range, Taiwan, with data from four multispectral satellite sensors (GeoEye, SPOT-7, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) to identify spectral features that best explain variation in vegetation structure at the mountain treeline and the effect of sensor spatial resolution on the characterisation of structural variation. The green, red and short-wave infrared spectral bands and vegetation indices based on green and short-wave infrared bands offer the best characterisation of forest structure with R-2 values reported up to 0.723. There is very little quantitative difference in the ability of the sensors tested here to discriminate between discrete descriptors of vegetation structure (difference of R-MF(2) within 0.09). While Landsat-8 is less well suited to defining above-ground woody biomass (R-2 0.12-0.29 lower than the alternative sensors), there is little difference between the relationships defined for GeoEye, SPOT-7 and Sentinel-2 data (difference in R-2 < 0.03). Discrete classifications are best suited to the identification of forest structures indicative of treeline advance or stasis, using a simplified class designation to separate areas of old growth forest, forest advance and grassland habitats. Consequently, our results present a major opportunity to improve quantification of forest range shifts across mountain systems and to estimate the impacts of forest advance on biodiversity and ecosystem function.

TI  - An Analysis of the Causes of Deforestation in Malawi: A Case of Mwazisi
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is recognized as a major driver of the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. It also disturbs natural processes such as biogeochemical, hydrological, and ecological cycles. In Malawi, deforestation is estimated to be responsible for the loss of 33,000 hectares per year, and is mainly attributed to agriculture expansion, tobacco growing, and excessive use of biomass. However, little research has been conducted at either the local level or that of forests located on customary land. This research aimed to identify and analyze the underlying driving factors associated with the proximate factors of agriculture expansion, tobacco growing, and brick burning in Mwazisi. Landsat images for 1991, 2004, and 2017 were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey website and used to analyze changes in forest cover. Interviews with households (n = 399) and Natural Resource Committee members, a focus group discussion with key officers, and observations were conducted during field data collection in 2017. The results of the land cover analysis showed that forest covered 66% of the study area in 1991, and by 2017 it had decreased to 45.8%. Most households depend on wood from customary land forests for tobacco curing (69%) and brick burning (68%). Furthermore, 47.6% of the households have expanded their agriculture land by approximately 0.57 hectares during the past 15 years. The interview survey and the focus group discussion identified that the underlying driving factors towards these anthropogenic activities are: (a) population growth, (b) poverty, (c) expensive alternative building materials, (d) lack of awareness, (e) lack of resources, (f) lack of commitment from the tobacco companies, and (g) market system of the cash crops grown in the area. In conclusion, a set of economic, institutional, social, and demographic factors, which are associated with imbalanced relationship between rural and urban areas, underpin agriculture expansion, tobacco growing, and brick burning, and have thereby contributed to the decline of the forest cover in Mwazisi, Malawi.

TI  - Incidence of Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fevers Among Adolescents and Adults in Yangon, Myanmar
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Accurate estimates of typhoid disease burden are needed to guide policy decisions, including on vaccine use. Data on the incidence of enteric fever in Myanmar are scarce. We estimated typhoid and paratyphoid fever incidence among adolescents and adults in Yangon, Myanmar, by combining sentinel hospital surveillance with a healthcare utilization survey.Methods We conducted a population-based household health care utilization survey in the Yangon Region 12 March through 5 April 2018. Multipliers derived from this survey were then applied to hospital-based surveillance of Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A bloodstream infections from 5 October 2015 through 4 October 2016 at Yangon General Hospital (YGH) to estimate the incidence of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers among person 12 years of age.Results A total of 336 households representing 1598 persons were enrolled in the health care utilization survey, and multipliers were derived based on responses to questions about healthcare seeking in the event of febrile illness. Of 671 Yangon residents enrolled over a 1-year period at YGH, we identified 33 (4.9%) with Salmonella Typhi and 9 (1.3%) with Salmonella Paratyphi A bloodstream infection. After applying multipliers, we estimated that the annual incidence of typhoid was 391 per 100 000 persons and paratyphoid was 107 per 100 000 persons.Conclusions Enteric fever incidence is high in Yangon, Myanmar, warranting increased attention on prevention and control, including consideration of typhoid conjugate vaccine use as well as nonvaccine control measures. Research on incidence among infants and children, as well as sources and modes of transmission is needed.Typhoid and paratyphoid fever incidence is high among adolescents and adults in Yangon, Myanmar. Research is needed to understand incidence among infants and children and on sources and modes of transmission. Consideration should be given to typhoid conjugate implementation.

TI  - Representing explicit budburst and senescence processes for evergreen conifers in global models
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global ecosystem models lack an explicit representation of budburst and senescence for evergreen conifers despite their primordial role in the carbon cycle. In this study we evaluated eight different budburst models, combining forcing, chilling and photoperiod, for their ability to describe spring budburst, and one model of needle senescence for temperate evergreen coniferous forests. The models' parameters were optimized against field observations from a national forest monitoring network in France. The best fitting budburst model was determined according to a new metrics which accounts for both temporal and spatial variabilities of budburst events across sites. The best model could reproduce observed budburst dates both at the site scale ( +/- 5 days) and at regional scale ( +/- 12 days). We also showed that the budburst models parameterized at site scale lose some predictive capability when applied at coarser spatial resolution, e.g., in grid-based simulations. The selected budburst model was then coupled to a senescence function defined from needle survivorship observations in order to describe the full phenology cycle of coniferous forests. Implemented in the process-driven ecosystem model ORCHIDEE, this new conifer phenology module represented accurately the intra and inter-annual dynamics of leaf area index at both the local and regional scales when compared against MODIS remote sensing observations. A sensitivity analysis showed only a small impact of the new budburst model on the timing of the seasonal cycle of photosynthesis (GPP). Yet, due to the faster renewal of needles compared to the standard version of ORCHIDEE, we simulated an increase in the GPP by on average 15% over France, while the simulated needle turnover was doubled. Compared to 1970-2000, projections indicated an advancement of the budburst date of 10.3 +/- 2.8 and 12.3 +/- 4.1 days in average over the period 2060-2100 with the best forcing and chilling-forcing models respectively. Our study suggests that including an explicit simulation of needle budburst and senescence for evergreen conifers in global terrestrial ecosystem models may significantly impact future projections of carbon budgets.

TI  - Estimation of the nearshore bathymetry from high temporal resolution Sentinel-1A C-band SAR data - A case study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the changes in swell properties in the nearshore domain due to interaction with the sea-bottom to infer the bathymetry has deserved some attention in the last few years. Satellite Remote Sensing images, in particular Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), have been used to produce a directional wave spectrum by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), from which the wavelength and wave direction of the ocean surface waves can be retrieved. These wave properties can be directly used in the linear dispersion relation to estimate the water depth.The present work takes advantages from the very short revisit times of the Sentinel-1A with C-band (5.405 GHz) SAR images with 10 m of spatial resolution to study the repeatability of this methodology for deriving the nearshore sea-bottom morphology, using a case study in the Aveiro region, located in the Portuguese West Coast. This site is exposed to high energetic wave climate of the North Atlantic Ocean. Overall, a set of four images were selected for the analysis.The robustness of the FFT methodology to calculate the wavelength and wave direction from SAR images was analysed through calculating their standard deviations. The errors of estimating the local bathymetry from these quantities was accessed which allowed to quantify the water depth limits of application of this methodology.The set of images was used to establish a bathymetric estimation that merges the derived bathymetry of each image. The computed bathymetry was quantitatively compared with the measurements made in 2013 and available at RATA Observatory. The relative error of the water depth ranges between 6% and 10%, but increases for the higher depths and depends on the accuracy of the computed wavelength at deep-waters. The merged derived bathymetry also provides a better approximation for the measured bathymetry than those derived from the individual images.

TI  - Cross-Country Assessment of H-SAF Snow Products by Sentinel-2 Imagery Validated against In-Situ Observations and Webcam Photography
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on snow properties is of critical relevance for a wide range of scientific studies and operational applications, mainly for hydrological purposes. However, the ground-based monitoring of snow dynamics is a challenging task, especially over complex topography and under harsh environmental conditions. Remote sensing is a powerful resource providing snow observations at a large scale. This study addresses the potential of using Sentinel-2 high-resolution imagery to assess moderate-resolution snow products, namely H10-Snow detection (SN-OBS-1) and H12-Effective snow cover (SN-OBS-3) supplied by the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) project of the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). With the aim of investigating the reliability of reference data, the consistency of Sentinel-2 observations is evaluated against both in-situ snow measurements and webcam digital imagery. The study area encompasses three different regions, located in Finland, the Italian Alps and Turkey, to comprehensively analyze the selected satellite products over both mountainous and flat areas having different snow seasonality. The results over the winter seasons 2016/17 and 2017/18 show a satisfying agreement between Sentinel-2 data and ground-based observations, both in terms of snow extent and fractional snow cover. H-SAF products prove to be consistent with the high-resolution imagery, especially over flat areas. Indeed, while vegetation only slightly affects the detection of snow cover, the complex topography more strongly impacts product performances.

TI  - Analysis of a Pollution Process in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region Based on Satellite and Surface Observations
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The air pollution control of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH region) is gradually moving toward regional joint mode. Remote sensing technology can be used to realize real-time dynamic monitoring over a wide range of space and ground-based monitoring can obtain accurate point information. Combining satellite with ground-based data, the formation and dissipation of pollution can be traced in three dimensions. For this paper, we analyzed the formation process, transmission path, coverage area, and the meteorological characteristies of the pollution process over the BTH region during March 8-10, 2018, using satellite remove sensing data, surface PM2.5 concentration data, meteorological data, and lidar data. The results showed that an area of 200 000 km(2) was affected by this pollution process and that the grade of the pollution reached the fourth level (moderate pollution level). The regional transmission process was very typical in this process. During 8-9 March, the occurence frequency of the southward wind was about 50% in the Beijing-Baoding region and 100% over the southern part of Hebei. With the help of continuous southward wind, the air quality of the Beijing-Baoding area ries from the first level to the fourth level. The high value area of aerosol optical thickness moved from the western part of the Handan-Xingtai region to the front of Yanshan Mountain. On 10 March, the weak north wind affected the region and the humidity increased obviously. A pollution convergence formed in the southern part of the BTH region. The center of pollution moved southward to the east part of the Handan-Xingtai Region. In the afternoon, with the help of the eastern wind, the air quality of Beijing got better from East to West. The vertical lidar observation results showed the pollution layer above Beijing was mainly below 1 000 m. There were two inversion layers below 800 m and 1 200-1 500 m, respectively. The inversion temperature was as high as 4-7 degrees C, which is unfavorable for vertical diffusion of pollutants. Thus, under the high intensity of regional energy consumption and pollution emissions background, the regional heavy pollution form easily once the weather conditions are bad.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-2 time-series for mapping floodplain grassland plant communities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring grassland plant communities is crucial for understanding and managing biodiversity. Previous studies indicate that mapping these natural habitats from single-date remotely sensed imagery remains challenging because some communities have similar physiognomy. The recently launched Sentinel-2 satellites are a promising opportunity for monitoring vegetation. This article assesses the advantages of Sentinel-2 time-series for discriminating plant communities in wet grasslands. An annual Sentinel-2 time-series was compared respectively to single-date and single-band datasets derived from this time-series for mapping grassland plant communities in a temperate floodplain located near Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, which is included in the long-term ecological research network "ZA Armorique" (France). At this 475 ha site, 123 vegetation releves were collected and assigned to seven plant communities to calibrate and validate the Sentinel-2 data. Satellite images were classified using support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers. Results show that the SVM classifier performs slightly better than the RF classifier (overall accuracy 0.78 and 0.71, respectively). They highlight that accuracy is lower when using single-date (0.67) or single-band images (0.70). The results also reveal that discrimination of plant communities is more sensitive to temporal resolution (Delta = 0.34 in overall accuracy) than spectral resolution (Delta = 0.12 in overall accuracy).

TI  - Spatio-temporal variations of cloud fraction based on circulation types in the Iberian Peninsula
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the first systematic study of the relationships between atmospheric circulation types (CT) and cloud fraction (CF) over the whole Iberian Peninsula, using satellite data from the MODIS (MOD09GA and MYD09GA) cloud mask for the period 2001-2017. The high level of detail, in combination with a classification for circulation patterns, provides us with relevant information about the spatio-temporal variability of cloudiness and the main mechanisms affecting the genesis of clouds. The results show that westerly CTs are the most influential, followed by cyclonic types, in cloudiness in the west of the Iberian Peninsula. Westerly flows, however, do not affect the Mediterranean coastline, which is dominated by easterly CTs, suggesting that local factors such as convective processes, orography and proximity to a body of warm water could play a major role in cloudiness processes. The Cantabrian Coast also has a particularly characteristic cloudiness dominated by northerly CTs. In general, the results found in this study are in line with the few studies that exist on cloudiness in the Iberian Peninsula. Furthermore, the results are geographically consistent, showing links to synoptic forcing in terms of atmospheric circulation patterns and the impact of the Iberian Peninsula's complex orography upon this element of the climate system.

TI  - Serum miRNA-based Prediction of Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the gold-standard procedure for evaluating axillary lymph node (ALN) status in patients with breast cancer. However, the morbidity of SLNB is not negligible, and the procedure is invasive for patients without ALN metastasis. Here, we developed a diagnostic model for evaluating ALN status using a combination of serum miRNAs and clinicopathologic factors as a novel less-invasive biomarker.Experimental Design: Preoperative serum samples were collected from patients who underwent surgery for primary breast cancer or breast benign diseases between 2008 and 2014. A total of 958 serum samples (921 cases of primary breast cancer, including 630 cases in the no ALN metastasis group and 291 cases in the ALN metastasis group, and 37 patients with benign breast diseases) were analyzed by miRNA microarray. Samples were randomly divided into training and test sets. Logistic LASSO regression analysis was used to construct diagnostic models in the training set, which were validated in the test set.Results: An optimal diagnostic model was identified using a combination of two miRNAs (miR-629-3p and miR-4710) and three clinicopathologic factors (T stage, lymphovascular invasion, and ultrasound findings), which showed a sensitivity of 0.88 (0.84-0.92), a specificity of 0.69 (0.61-0.76), an accuracy of 0.818, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 in the test set.Conclusions: Serum miRNA profiles may be useful for the diagnosis of ALN metastasis before surgery in a less-invasive manner than SLNB.

TI  - Development of a dynamic dust source map for NMME-DREAM v1.0 model based on MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over the Arabian Peninsula
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a time-dependent dust source map for the NMME Dust Regional Atmospheric Model (DREAM v1.0) based on the satellite MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Areas with NDVI < 0.1 are classified as active dust sources. The updated modeling system is tested for dust emission capabilities over SW Asia using a mesoscale model grid increment of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees for a period of 1 year (2016). Our results indicate significant deviations in simulated aerosol optical depths (AODs) compared to the static dust source approach and general increase in dust loads over the selected domain. Comparison with MODIS AOD indicates a more realistic spatial distribution of dust in the dynamic source simulations compared to the static dust sources approach. The modeled AOD bias is improved from 0.140 to 0.083 for the case of dust events (i.e., for AOD > 0.25) and from -0.933 to -0.424 for dust episodes with AOD > 1. This new development can be easily applied to other time periods, models, and different areas worldwide for a local fine tuning of the parameterization and assessment of its performance.

TI  - Seasonal and spatial variations in biomarker baseline levels within Arctic populations of mussels (<i>Mytilus</i> spp.)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and pollution resulting from human activities in the Arctic require reliable monitoring systems in sentinel species. Mytilus spp. are used as sentinel species all around the world. The use of Mytilus spp. in environmental monitoring requires knowledge about natural variations in pollution biomarkers. Seasonal variations in baseline levels of biomarkers were studied over a year in the mussels from both upper and lower littoral zones in Rakkfjorden, Norway, as they underwent their annual reproductive cycle. Spatial variations of these biomarker baseline levels were measured in five mussel populations within a 60-km radius from Rakkfjorden to investigate universality of the results from the specific population of Rakkfjorden at a regional scale. Seasonal variations in biomarker baseline levels were revealed and seemed to be related to the reproductive state of the mussels and the tidal zone. The mussels appeared to be more sensitive to oxidative stress during gametogenesis in autumn and winter, when having lower lysosome membrane stability and lower baseline levels of antioxidant biomarkers. An increase in baseline levels of these biomarkers was reported during spawning in spring, however, it was not possible to reveal whether these changes were due to spawning, or to a higher metabolic activity in mussels in response to elevated water temperature and food abundance. The differences between the tidal zones were reflected in reduced size of the mussels from the upper littoral zone, their late spawning in the season and increased baseline levels of antioxidant biomarkers during the coldest month, indicating a more challenging environment in the upper littoral zone. The spatial study indicated that the biomarker baseline levels measured in Rakkfjorden were no different from the levels measured in the mussels from five other sites and thus, are representative for mussels on a regional scale.

TI  - Defining Cultivation Rate
T2  - HUMAN ARENAS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - After the first year of its existence, Human Arenas is celebrating quite impressive results obtained during 2018. The core of the journal's editorial policy is the innovative concept of "cultivation rate," which is challenging a too rigid and short-sighted academic publishing system. Human Arenas editorial policy is oriented towards the other as an epistemic subject to be first welcomed, then understood in her own worldview and then, possibly, supported in developing further her line of reasoning. This editorial is also a public act of acknowledgement to all the scholars who helped us promoting the idea of reviewing as a scientific dialogue and mutual learning process. Finally, we outline the scientific endeavors of Human Arenas for the year 2019, wishing to be the fertile cultivation soil in which human minds can garden the new ideas of the future.

TI  - Sentinel-2 image capacities to predict common topsoil properties of temperate and Mediterranean agroecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To be fully operational for facilitating decisions made at any spatial level, models and indicators of soil ecosystem functions require the use of precise spatially referenced soil information as inputs. This study aimed at exploring the capacity for Sentinel-2A (S2A) multispectral satellite images to predict several topsoil properties in two contrasted pedoclimatic environments: a temperate region marked by intensive annual crop cultivation patterns and soils derived from loess or colluvium and/or marine limestone or chalk (Versailles Plain, 221 km(2)); and a Mediterranean region marked by vineyard cultivation and soils derived from lacustrine limestone, calcareous sandstones, colluvium, or alluvial deposits (Peyne catchment, 48 km(2)). Prediction models of soil properties based on partial least squares regressions (PLSR) were built from S2A spectra of 72 and 143 sampling locations across the Versailles Plain and Peyne catchment, respectively. Eight soil surface properties were investigated in both regions: pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), texture fractions (Clay, Silt, Sand), Iron, Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) content. Predictive abilities were studied according to the root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) tests, cross-validated coefficient of determination (R-cv(2)) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). Intermediate prediction performance outcomes (R-cv(2) and RPD greater than or equal to 0.5 and 1.4, respectively) were obtained for 4 topsoil properties found across the Versailles Plain (SOC, pH, CaCO3 and CEC), and near-intermediate performance outcomes (0.5 > R-cv(2) > 0.39, 1.4 > RPD > 1.3) were yielded for 3 topsoil properties (Clay, Iron, and CEC) found across the Peyne catchment and for 1 property (Clay) found across the Versailles Plain. The study results show what can be expected from Sentinel-2 images in terms of predictive capacities at the regional scale. The spatial structure of the estimated soil properties for bare soils pixels is highlighted, promising further improvements made to spatial prediction models for these properties based on the use of Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) techniques.

TI  - Large spatial variations in the flux balance along the front of a Greenland tidewater glacier
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The frontal flux balance of a medium-sized tidewater glacier in western Greenland in the summer is assessed by quantifying the individual components (ice flux, retreat, calving, and submarine melting) through a combination of data and models. Ice flux and retreat are obtained from satellite data. Submarine melting is derived using a high-resolution ocean model informed by near-ice observations, and calving is estimated using a record of calving events along the ice front. All terms exhibit large spatial variability along the similar to 5 km wide ice front. It is found that submarine melting accounts for much of the frontal ablation in small regions where two subglacial discharge plumes emerge at the ice front. Away from the subglacial plumes, the estimated melting accounts for a small fraction of frontal ablation. Glacier-wide, these estimates suggest that mass loss is largely controlled by calving. This result, however, is at odds with the limited presence of icebergs at this calving front - suggesting that melt rates in regions outside of the subglacial plumes may be underestimated. Finally, we argue that localized melt incisions into the glacier front can be significant drivers of calving. Our results suggest a complex interplay of melting and calving marked by high spatial variability along the glacier front.

TI  - Climate-phenology-hydrology interactions in northern high latitudes: Assessing the value of remote sensing data in catchment ecohydrological studies
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the hydrological implications of climate effects on vegetation phenology in northern environments by fusion of data from remote-sensing and local catchment monitoring. Studies using satellite data have shown earlier and later dates for the start (SOS) and end of growing seasons (EOS), respectively, in the Northern Hemisphere over the last 3 decades. However, estimates of the change greatly depend on the satellite data utilized. Validation with experimental data on climate-vegetation-hydrology interactions requires long-term observations of multiple variables which are rare and usually restricted to small catchments. In this study, we used two NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) products (at similar to 25 & 0.5 km spatial resolutions) to infer SOS and EOS for six northern catchments, and then investigated the likely climate impacts on phenology change and consequent effects on catchment water yield, using both assimilated data (GLDAS: global land data assimilation system) and direct catchment observations. The major findings are: (1) The assimilated air temperature compared well with catchment observations (regression slopes and R-2 close to 1), whereas underestimations of summer rainstorms resulted in overall underestimations of precipitation (regression slopes of 0.3-0.7, R-2 >= 0.46). (2) The two NDVI products inferred different vegetation phenology characteristics. (3) Increased mean pre-season temperature significantly influenced the advance of SOS and delay of EOS. The precipitation influence was weaker, but delayed SOS corresponding to increased pre-season precipitation at most sites can be related to later snow melting. (4) Decreased catchment streamflow over the last 15 years could be related to the advance in SOS and extension of growing seasons. Greater streamflow reductions in the cold sites than the warm ones imply stronger climate warming impacts on vegetation and hydrology in colder northerly environments. The methods used in this study have potential for better understanding interactions between vegetation, climate and hydrology in observation-scarce regions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Understanding the relationship between vegetation greenness and productivity across dryland ecosystems through the integration of PhenoCam, satellite, and eddy covariance data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drylands account for approximately 40% of the global land surface and play a dominant role in the trend and variability of terrestrial carbon uptake and storage. Gross ecosystem photosynthesis termed gross primary productivity (GPP) is a critical driver of terrestrial carbon uptake and remains challenging to be observed directly. Currently, vegetation indices that largely capture changes in greenness are the most commonly used datasets in satellite-based GPP modeling. However, there remains significant uncertainty in the spatiotemporal relationship between greenness indices and GPP, especially for relatively heterogeneous dryland ecosystems. In this paper, we compared vegetation greenness indices from PhenoCam and satellite (Landsat and MODIS) observations against GPP estimates from the eddy covariance technique, across three representative ecosystem types of the southwestern United States. We systematically evaluated the changes in the relationship between vegetation greenness indices and GPP: i) across spatial scales of canopy-level, 30-meter, and 500-meter resolution; and ii) across temporal scale of daily, 8-day, 16-day, and monthly resolution. We found that greenness-GPP relationships were independent of spatial scales as long as land cover type and composition remained relatively constant. We also found that the greenness-GPP relationships became stronger as the time interval increased, with the strongest relationships observed at the monthly resolution. We posit that the greenness-GPP relationship breaks down at short timescales because greenness changes more slowly than plant physiological function, which responds rapidly to changes in key biophysical drivers. These findings provide insights into the potential for and limitations of modeling GPP using remotely sensed greenness indices across dryland ecosystem types.

TI  - Individual mangrove tree measurement using UAV-based LiDAR data: Possibilities and challenges
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Individual mangrove tree parameters are necessary for the efficient management and protection of this unique ecosystem, but to measure them using remote sensing (RS) is still a new and challenging task due to the high clumping density of mangrove crowns and the relatively low spatial resolution of RS data. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as an emerging RS technique, significantly improves the spatial resolution, but has not been used for individual mangrove analysis. This study presents the first investigation into the possibility of individual tree detection and delineation (ITDD) for mangroves using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data (91 pt./m(2)) collected from UAV. Specifically, we aim to detect and measure tree height (TH) and crown diameter (CD) of each mangrove tree, and analyze the impact of crown clumping density and spatial resolution on mangrove ITDD. To this end, we combined the variable window filtering method and marker controlled watershed segmentation algorithm, and successfully delineated 46.0% of the 126 field measured mangroves. This was promising considering the complexity of mangrove forest. TH and CD were estimated with higher accuracies than previous studies. The isolated trees, with the lowest clumping density, were delineated with the highest accuracy. To identify the optimal spatial resolution of canopy height model (CHM), we defined four spatial resolutions (0.1 m, 0.25 m, 0.5 m, and 1 m) and conducted a simulation. Based on the results, we propose a rule-of thumb that the spatial resolution should be finer than one-fourth of CD for ITDD, which is also applicable to other forest types. The main difficulty for mangrove ITDD is an overall under-detection of trees, which is caused by the high clumping density and limited height difference between adjacent mangroves. We recommend combining UAV LiDAR with imagery and terrestrial LiDAR to improve the mangrove ITDD performance.

TI  - Chlorophyll content estimation in an open-canopy conifer forest with Sentinel-2A and hyperspectral imagery in the context of forest decline
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the advent of Sentinel-2, it is now possible to generate large-scale chlorophyll content maps with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, suitable for monitoring ecological processes such as vegetative stress and/or decline. However methodological gaps exist for adapting this technology to heterogeneous natural vegetation and for transferring it among vegetation species or plan functional types. In this study, we investigated the use of Sentinel-2A imagery for estimating needle chlorophyll (Ca+b) in a sparse pine forest undergoing significant needle loss and tree mortality. Sentinel-2A scenes were acquired under two extreme viewing geometries (June vs. December 2016) coincident with the acquisition of high-spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery, and field measurements of needle chlorophyll content and crown leaf area index. Using the high-resolution hyperspectral scenes acquired over 61 validation sites we found the CI chlorophyll index R-750/R-710 and Macc index (which uses spectral bands centered at 680 nm, 710 nm and 780 nm) had the strongest relationship with needle chlorophyll content from individual tree crowns (r(2) = 0.61 and r(2) = 0.59, respectively; p < 0.001), while TCARI and TCARI/OSAVI, originally designed for uniform agricultural canopies, did not perform as well (r(2) = 0.21 and r(2) = 0.01, respectively). Using lower-resolution Sentinel-2A data validated against hyperspectral estimates and ground truth needle chlorophyll content, the red-edge index CI and the Sentinel-specific chlorophyll indices CI-Gitelson, NDRE1 and NDRE2 had the highest accuracy (with r(2) values > 0.7 for June and > 0.4 for December; p < 0.001). The retrieval of needle chlorophyll content from the entire Sentinel-2A handset using the radiative transfer model INFORM yielded r(2) = 0.71 (RMSE = 8.1 mu g/cm(2)) for June, r(2) = 0.42 (RMSE = 12.2 mu g/cm(2)) for December, and r(2) = 0.6 (RMSE = 10.5 mu g/cm(2)) as overall performance using the June and December datasets together. This study demonstrates the retrieval of leaf Ca+b with Sentinel-2A imagery by red-edge indices and by an inversion method based on a hybrid canopy reflectance model that accounts for tree density, background and shadow components common in sparse forest canopies.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil properties using multiple machine learning in a semi-arid region, central Iran
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about distribution of soil properties over the landscape is required for a variety of land management applications and resources, modeling, and monitoring practices. The main aim of this research was to conduct a spatially prediction of the top soil properties such as soil organic carbon (SOC), calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), and clay content using digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches in Borujen region, Chaharmahal-Va-Bakhtiari province, central Iran. To achieve this goal, a total of 334 soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 cm depth. Three non-linear models including Cubist (Cu), Random Forest (RF), Regression Tree (RT) and a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were used to link environmental covariates and the studied soil properties. The environmental covariates were obtained from a digital elevation model (DEM) and satellite imagery (Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper; ETM). The model was calibrated and validated by the 10-fold cross-validation approach. Root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) were used to determine the performance of the models, and relative RMSE (RMSE%) was used to define prediction accuracy. According to the RMSE and R-2, Cu and RF resulted in the most accurate predictions for CCE (R-2 = 0.30 and RMSE = 9.52) and clay contents (R-2 = 0.15 and RMSE = 7.86), respectively, while both of RF and Cu models showed the highest performance to predict SOC content (R-2 = 0.55). Results showed that remote sensing covariates (Ratio Vegetation Index and band 4) were the most important variables to explain the variability of SOC and CCE content, but only topographic attributes were responsible for clay content variation. According to RMSE% results, it could be concluded that the best model is not necessarily able to make the most accurate estimation. This study recommended that more observations and denser sampling should be carried out in the entire study area. Alternatively, stratified sampling by elevation in homogeneous sub-areas was recommended. The stratified sampling probably will increase the performance of models.

TI  - A statistical analysis of TIR anomalies extracted by RSTs in relation to an earthquake in the Sichuan area using MODIS LST data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Research in the field of earthquake prediction has a long history, but the inadequacies of traditional approaches to the study of seismic threats have become increasingly evident. Remote sensing and Earth observation technology, an emerging method that can rapidly capture information concerning anomalies associated with seismic activity across a wide geographic area, has for some time been believed to be the key to overcoming the bottleneck in earthquake prediction studies. However, a multi-parametric method appears to be the most promising approach for increasing the reliability and precision of short-term seismic hazard forecasting, and thermal infrared (TIR) anomalies are important earthquake precursors. While several studies have investigated the correlation among TIR anomalies identified by the robust satellite techniques (RSTs) methodology and single earthquakes, few studies have extracted TIR anomalies over a long period within a large study area. Moreover, statistical analyses are required to determine whether TIR anomalies are precursors to earthquakes. In this paper, RST data analysis and the Robust Estimator of TIR Anomalies (RETIRA) index were used to extract the TIR anomalies from 2002 to 2018 in the Sichuan region using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) data, while the earthquake catalog was used to ascertain the correlation between TIR anomalies and earthquake occurrences. Most TIR anomalies corresponded to earthquakes, and statistical methods were used to verify the correlation between the extracted TIR anomalies and earthquakes. This is the first time that the ability to predict earthquakes has been evaluated based on the positive predictive value (PPV), false discovery rate (FDR), true-positive rate (TPR), and false-negative rate (FNR). The statistical results indicate that the prediction potential of RSTs with use of MODIS is limited with regard to the Sichuan region.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Information of built-up area is essential for various applications, such as sustainable development or urban planning. Built-up area extraction using optical data is challenging due to spectral confusion between built-up and other classes (bare land or river sand, etc.). Here an automated approach has been proposed to generate built-up maps using spectral-textural features and feature selection techniques. Eight Grey-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix based texture features are extracted using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager bands and combined with multispectral data. The most informative features are selected from combined spectral-textural dataset using feature selection techniques. Further, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are trained on labelled samples using optimal features and results are compared with Back Propagation-Neural Network (BP-NN) and k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN). The results show that inclusion of textural features and applying feature selection methods increases the highest overall accuracy of Linear-SVM, RBF-SVM, BP-NN, and k-NN by 9.20%, 9.09%, 8.42%, and 7.39%, respectively.

TI  - Atmospheric ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) emanations from Lake Natron's saline mudflats
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In a recent global analysis of satellite-derived atmospheric NH3 data, a hotspot was observed in the vicinity of Lake Natron, Tanzania. The lake is in the centre of an endorheic (limited drainage) basin and has shallow, saline-alkaline waters. Its remote location and the absence of nearby large anthropogenic sources suggest that the observed NH3 is mainly of natural origin. Here we explore 10 years of IASI NH3 satellite data and other publicly available datasets over the area to characterize the natural NH3 emissions in this unique ecosystem. Temporal analysis reveals that the emissions are episodic and linked with the lake's surface area. The largest NH3 column loadings generally occur at the end of the dry season in September-November over Lake Natron's largest mudflat, that is exposed with receding water levels. The timing is different from the agricultural dominated NH3 emissions in the wider Natron area, which peak early in the year, after the first wet season. The likely source of NH3 at Lake Natron is decomposition of organic material, either from rivers and springs or produced in the lake (plankton, bird excreta). High temperatures and alkalinity are known to promote NH3 losses from soda lakes. We formulate six processes that may explain why the largest losses are observed specifically over concentrated brines and/ or exposed sediments. As a by-product, we also show that hyperspectral infrared sounders such as IASI are capable of mapping different types of evaporative minerals such as trona and thermonatrite.

TI  - Multi-satellite retrieval of single scattering albedo using the OMI-MODIS algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Single scattering albedo (SSA) represents a unique identification of aerosol type and can be a determinant factor in the estimation of aerosol radiative forcing. However, SSA retrievals are highly uncertain due to cloud contamination and aerosol composition. The recent improvement in the SSA retrieval algorithm has combined the superior cloud-masking technique of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the higher sensitivity of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) to aerosol absorption. The combined OMI-MODIS algorithm has only been validated over a small spatial and temporal scale. The present study validates the algorithm over global oceans for the period from 2008 to 2012. The geographical heterogeneity in the aerosol type and concentration over the Atlantic Ocean, the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal was useful to delineate the effect of aerosol type on the retrieval algorithm. We also noted that OMI overestimated SSA when absorbing aerosols were present closer to the surface. We attribute this overestimation to data discontinuity in the aerosol height climatology derived from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite. OMI uses predefined aerosol heights over regions where CALIPSO climatology is not present, leading to the overestimation of SSA. The importance of aerosol height was also studied using the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model. The results from the joint retrievals were validated using cruise-based measurements. It as seen that OMI-MODIS SSA retrievals performed better than the OMI only retrieval over the Bay of Bengal during winter, when the aerosols are present closer to the surface. Discrepancy between satellite retrievals and cruise measurements was seen when elevated aerosols were present which might not have been detected by the cruise instruments.

TI  - Quantification of cotton water consumption by remote sensing
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying crop water consumption is essential for water resource management. The objective was to estimate the current evapotranspiration (ETa) of the cotton crop (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in the rainfed system, as well as the components of the radiation and energy balance in the Cerrado biome conditions using orbital images and the SEBAL algorithm and validate the estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) using FAO guidelines for crop coefficient (K-c) of the cotton crop. Research was carried out in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil, in areas with three cotton cultivars. Images of the Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor sensors were used and ET estimation was made based on the SEBAL algorithm. Mean ETa in the cotton cycle was 3.5 mm dia(-1) and the K-c values ranged from 0.22 and 1.12, on average, in the smaller and larger leaf area, respectively.

TI  - Genetic regulation of methylation in human endometrium and blood and gene targets for reproductive diseases
T2  - CLINICAL EPIGENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMajor challenges in understanding the functional consequences of genetic risk factors for human disease are which tissues and cell types are affected and the limited availability of suitable tissue. The aim of this study was to evaluate tissue-specific genotype-epigenetic characteristics in DNA samples from both endometrium and blood collected from women at different stages of the menstrual cycle and relate results to genetic risk factors for reproductive traits and diseases.ResultsWe analysed DNA methylation (DNAm) data from endometrium and blood samples from 66 European women. Methylation profiles were compared between stages of the menstrual cycle, and changes in methylation overlaid with changes in transcription and genotypes. We observed large changes in methylation (27,262 DNAm probes) across the menstrual cycle in endometrium that were not observed in blood. Individual genotype data was tested for association with methylation at 443,016 and 443,101 DNAm probes in endometrium and blood respectively to identify methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs). A total of 4546 sentinel cis-mQTLs (P<1.13x10(-10)) and 434 sentinel trans-mQTLs (P<2.29x10(-12)) were detected in endometrium and 6615 sentinel cis-mQTLs (P<1.13x10(-10)) and 590 sentinel trans-mQTLs (P<2.29x10(-12)) were detected in blood. Following secondary analyses, conducted to test for overlap between mQTLs in the two tissues, we found that 62% of endometrial cis-mQTLs were also observed in blood and the genetic effects between tissues were highly correlated. A number of mQTL SNPs were associated with reproductive traits and diseases, including one mQTL located in a known risk region for endometriosis (near GREB1).ConclusionsWe report novel findings characterising genetic regulation of methylation in endometrium and the association of endometrial mQTLs with endometriosis risk and other reproductive traits and diseases. The high correlation of genetic effects between tissues highlights the potential to exploit the power of large mQTL datasets in endometrial research and identify target genes for functional studies. However, tissue-specific methylation profiles and genetic effects also highlight the importance of also using disease-relevant tissues when investigating molecular mechanisms of disease risk.

TI  - Evaluation of the sentinel surveillance system for influenza-like illnesses in the Greater Accra region, Ghana, 2018
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInfluenza-like Illness (ILI) is a medical diagnosis of possible influenza or another respiratory illness with a common set of symptoms. The deaths of four schoolchildren, during a pandemic influenza outbreak in December 2017 in Ghana, raised doubts about the ILI surveillance system's performance. We evaluated the ILI surveillance system in the Greater Accra region, Ghana, to assess the system's attributes and its performance on set objectives.MethodsCDC guidelines were used to evaluate the data of the ILI surveillance system between 2013 and 2017. We interviewed the surveillance personnel on the system's description and operation. Additionally, routinely entered ILI data from the National Influenza Center provided by the six sentinel sites in Accra was extracted. We sampled and reviewed 120 ILI case-investigation forms from these sites. Surveillance activities were examined on system's performance indicators, each being scored on a scale of 1 to 3 (poorest to best performance).ResultsAll population and age groups were under ILI surveillance over the period evaluated. Overall, 2948 suspected case-patients, including 392 (13.3%) children under-five were reported, with 219 being positive for influenza virus (Predictive value positive = 7.4%). The predominant influenza subtype was H3N2, recorded in 90 (41.1%) of positive case-patients. The system only met two out of its four objectives. None of the six sentinel sites consistently met their annual 260 suspected case-detection quota. Samples reached the laboratory on average 48 hours after collection and results were disseminated within 7 days. Of 120 caseinvestigation forms sampled, 91 (76.3%) were completely filled in.ConclusionsThe ILI surveillance system in the Greater Accra region is only partially meeting its objectives. While it is found to be sensitive, representative and timely, the data quality was suboptimal. We recommend the determination of thresholds for alert and outbreak detection and ensuring that sentinel sites meet their weekly case-detection targets.

TI  - Hot Spots of Carbon and Alkalinity Cycling in the Coastal Oceans
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean calcium carbonate (CaCO3) production and preservation play a key role in the global carbon cycle. Coastal and continental shelf (neritic) environments account for more than half of global CaCO3 accumulation. Previous neritic CaCO3 budgets have been limited in both spatial resolution and ability to project responses to environmental change. Here, a 1 degrees spatially explicit budget for neritic CaCO3 accumulation is developed. Globally gridded satellite and benthic community area data are used to estimate community CaCO3 production. Accumulation rates (PgC yr(-1)) of four neritic environments are calculated: coral reefs/banks (0.084), seagrass-dominated embayments (0.043), and carbonate rich (0.037) and poor (0.0002) shelves. This analysis refines previous neritic CaCO3 accumulation estimates (-0.16) and shows almost all coastal carbonate accumulation occurs in the tropics, >50% of coral reef accumulation occurs in the Western Pacific Ocean, and 80% of coral reef, 63% of carbonate shelf, and 58% of bay accumulation occur within three global carbonate hot spots: the Western Pacific Ocean, Eastern Indian Ocean, and Caribbean Sea. These algorithms are amenable for incorporation into Earth System Models that represent open ocean pelagic CaCO3 production and deep-sea preservation and assess impacts and feedbacks of environmental change.

TI  - Epidemiology of Lyme borreliosis through two surveillance systems: the national Sentinelles GP network and the national hospital discharge database, France, 2005 to 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most frequent vector-borne disease in France. Since 2009, surveillance of LB is conducted by a sentinel network of general practitioners (GPs). This system, in conjunction with the national hospitalisation database was used to estimate the incidence and describe the characteristics of LB in France. Aim: To describe the estimated incidence and trends in GP consultations and hospital admissions for LB in France and identify risk groups and high-incidence regions. Results: From 2011 to 2016, the mean yearly incidence rate of LB cases was 53 per 100,000 inhabitants (95% CI: 41-65) ranging from 41 in 2011 to 84 per 100 000 in 2016. A mean of 799 cases per year were hospitalised with LB associated diagnoses 2005-16. The hospitalisation incidence rate (HIR) ranged from 1.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2005 to 1.5 in 2011 with no statistically significant trend. We observed seasonality with a peak during the summer, important inter-regional variations and a bimodal age distribution in LB incidence and HIR with higher incidence between 5 and 9 year olds and those aged 60 years. Erythema migrans affected 633/667 (95%) of the patients at primary care level. Among hospitalised cases, the most common manifestation was neuroborrellosis 4,906/9,594 (51%). Conclusion: Public health strategies should focus on high-incidence age groups and regions during the months with the highest incidences and should emphasise prevention measures such as regular tick checks after exposure and prompt removal to avoid infection.

TI  - Strong increase of true and false positive mycobacterial cultures sent to the National Reference Centre in Belgium, 2007 to 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In 2007, a new federal legislation in Belgium prohibited non-biosafety level 3 laboratories to process culture tubes suspected of containing mycobacteria. Aim: To present mycobacterial surveillance/diagnosis data from the Belgian National Reference Centre for mycobacteria (NRC) from 2007 to 2016. Methods: This retrospective observational study investigated the numbers of analyses at the NRC and false positive cultures (interpreted as containing mycobacteria at referring clinical laboratories, but with no mycobacterial DNA detected by PCR in the NRC). We reviewed mycobacterial species identified and assessed trends over time of proportions of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) vs Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBc), and false positive cultures vs NTM. Results: From 2007 to 2016, analyses requests to the NRC doubled from 12.6 to 25.3 per 100,000 inhabitants. A small but significant increase occurred in NTM vs MTBc proportions, from 57.9% (587/1,014) to 60.3% (867/1,437) (p < 0.001). Although NTM infection notification is not mandatory in Belgium, we annually received up to 8.6 NTM per 100,000 inhabitants. M. avium predominated (ca 20% of NTM cultures), but M. intracellulare culture numbers rose significantly, from 13.0% (74/587) of NTM cultures in 2007 to 21.0% (178/867) in 2016 (RR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.03-1.07). The number of false positive cultures also increased, reaching 43.3% (1,097/2,534) of all samples in 2016. Conclusion: We recommend inclusion of NTM in sentinel programmes. The large increase of false positive cultures is hypothesised to result from processing issues prior to arrival at the NRC, highlighting the importance of sample decontamination/transport and equipment calibration in peripheral laboratories.

TI  - Inland water body extraction in complex reliefs from Sentinel-1 satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water body classification is a topic of great interest, especially for the effective management of floods. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging has demonstrated a great potential for water monitoring, given its capacity to register images independent of weather conditions. Several algorithms for water detection using SAR images are based on optimal thresholding techniques. However, these simple methodologies produce false classification results when small water bodies embedded in mountain ranges are presented in the image. We present an unsupervised and easy-to-implement methodology, based on local Moran index of spatial association in combination with morphological closing operations, for inland water body extraction. According to several experiments, we demonstrate that our method is capable of effectively extracting lakes and rivers located at different land surface reliefs without the requirement of a training step. In addition, comparisons with the state-of-the-art techniques demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure, performing an overall accuracy of 96.37% and Kappa = 0.927.

TI  - Changes in Means and Extreme Events of Sea Surface Temperature in the East China Seas Based on Satellite Data from 1982 to 2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Marginal seas are fundamental to humans for their importance in mariculture resources and commerce. Based on the NOAA 0.25 degree daily Optimum Interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature (SST) data set, spatiotemporal changes in mean and extreme SST in the East China Seas (ECSs) were examined for from 1982 to 2017. As a regional average, the annual mean SST has notably increased at a rate of 0.21 +/- 0.08 degrees C per decade. The warming SST during 1982-2017 is probably related to the influence from a recent strengthening and westward extension of the WPSH. There are also notable warming trends in annual minimum and maximum SST. Spatially, the rapid warming of annual mean SSTs are located in the vicinity of the Yangtze Estuary, exceeding 0.2 degrees C per decade and part of the ECS-Kuroshio. This pattern may be largely affected by the spatial changes of minimum SST. Rapid warming of maximum SST can be found across the region, from the northern East China Sea (ECS) to the Bohai Sea. Since 1982, extreme hot days (EHDs) have undergone an obvious increasing trend, at a rate of 15.2 days per decade. Conversely, extreme cold days (ECDs) have been decreasing. Notably, the largest increase of EHDs appears in the western ECS and the Bohai Sea, which both have rich marine ecosystems. The trend of EHDs has a significant relationship to mean SST, suggesting that there will be a further increase in EHDs under continued warming in the ECSs. These findings emphasize the importance and urgency of strategies which should be planned for the adaptation and mitigation of specific types of extreme hot events in this region.

TI  - Stoic Theology: Revealing or Redundant?
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the notion of advancing a modern Stoic environmental ethical framework, we explore the philosophy's call to "living according to Nature", as derived from ancient Stoic theology. We do this by evaluating the orthodox (ancient) viewpoint and the contemporary criticisms levelled against it. We reflect on the atheistic interpretations of Stoicism and their associated call to "live according to the facts". We consider the limitations that this call has when applied to societal, and particularly non-human matters. We do not undertake this research with the aim of determining which view of Stoic theology is right or wrong. However, we contest one of the assumptions of the heterodox approach, namely that the Stoic worldview is incompatible with modern scientific thinking. Indeed, we demonstrate how Stoic theology, far from being outdated or irrelevant, is actually refreshingly contemporary in that it provides the tools, scope and urgency with which to deliver a far more considerate ethical framework for the 21st century. Finally, we suggest where Stoic theology can help practitioners to reframe and respond to environmental challenges, which we argue forms part of their cosmopolitan obligation to take care of themselves, others and the Earth as a whole.

TI  - Preoperative Prediction of Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer Using Mammography-Based Radiomics Method
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is difficult to accurately assess axillary lymph nodes metastasis and the diagnosis of axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer is invasive and has low-sensitivity preoperatively. This study aims to develop a mammography-based radiomics nomogram for the preoperative prediction of ALN metastasis in patients with breast cancer. This study enrolled 147 patients with clinicopathologically confirmed breast cancer and preoperative mammography. Features were extracted from each patient's mammography images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression method was used to select features and build a signature in the primary cohort. The performance of the signature was assessed using support vector machines. We developed a nomogram by incorporating the signature with the clinicopathologic risk factors. The nomogram performance was estimated by its calibration ability in the primary and validation cohorts. The signature was consisted of 10 selected ALN-statusrelated features. The AUC of the signature from the primary cohort was 0.895 (95% CI, 0.887-0.909) and 0.875 (95%CI, 0.698-0.891) for the validation cohort. The C-Index of the nomogram from the primary cohort was 0.779 (95% CI, 0.752-0.793) and 0.809 (95% CI, 0.794-0.833) for the validation cohort. Our nomogram is a reliable and non-invasive tool for preoperative prediction of ALN status and can be used to optimize current treatment strategy for breast cancer patients.

TI  - Dynamic Land Cover Mapping of Urbanized Cities with Landsat 8 Multi-temporal Images: Comparative Evaluation of Classification Algorithms and Dimension Reduction Methods
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncontrolled and continuous urbanization is an important problem in the metropolitan cities of developing countries. Urbanization progress that occurs due to population expansion and migration results in important changes in the land cover characteristics of a city. These changes mostly affect natural habitats and the ecosystem in a negative manner. Hence, urbanization-related changes should be monitored regularly, and land cover maps should be updated to reflect the current situation. This research presents a comparative evaluation of two classification algorithms, pixel-based support vector machine (SVM) classification and decision-tree-oriented geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) classification, in producing a dynamic land cover map of the Istanbul metropolitan city in Turkey between 2013 and 2017 using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) multi-temporal satellite images. Additionally, the efficiencies of the two data dimension reduction methods are evaluated as part of this research. For dimension reduction, built-up index (BUI) and principal component analysis (PCA) data were calculated for five images during the mentioned period, and the classification algorithms were applied on data stacks for each dimension reduction method. The classification results indicate that the GEOBIA classification of the BUI data set provided the highest accuracy, with a 91.60% overall accuracy and 0.91 kappa value. This combination was followed by the GEOBIA classification of the PCA data set, which highlights the overall efficiency of the GEOBIA over the SVM method. On the other hand, the BUI data set provided more reliable and consistent results for urban expansion classes due to representing physical responses of the surface when compared to the data set of the PCA, which is a spectral transformation method.

TI  - Toward Precision in Crop Yield Estimation Using Remote Sensing and Optimization Techniques
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Many crop yield estimation techniques are being used, however the most effective one is based on using geospatial data and technologies such as remote sensing. However, the remote sensing data which are needed to estimate crop yield are insufficient most of the time due to many problems such as climate conditions (% of clouds), and low temporal resolution. There have been many attempts to solve the lack of data problem using very high temporal and very low spatial resolution images such as Modis. Although this type of image can compensate for the lack of data due to climate problems, they are only suitable for very large homogeneous crop fields. To compensate for the lack of high spatial resolution remote sensing images due to climate conditions, a new optimization model was created. Crop yield estimation is improved and its precision is increased based on the new model that includes the use of the energy balance equation. To verify the results of the crop yield estimation based on the new model, information from local farmers about their potato crop yields for the same year were collected. The comparison between the estimated crop yields and the actual production in different fields proves the efficiency of the new optimization model.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to assess the presence of HPV DNA in cervical tissues and lymph nodes in patients who have uterine cervical neoplasms with lymphatic metastases and who underwent surgery for invasive cervical cancer and pelvic lymphadenectomy, to establish the utility of HPV type and viral load in predicting disease progression.Material/Methods: We retrospectively assessed 88 patients with uterine cervical neoplasms with lymph node metastases. All 88 patients were in FIGO stage IA-IIB. A total of 316 paraffin-embedded archival tissues (88 cervical samples and 228 pelvic lymph node specimens) were acquired. All the samples were analyzed using real-time PCR to determine HPV DNA presence/type and to quantify viral load.Results: In total, 17 HPV genotypes were detected in the cervical lesions and pelvic lymph nodes of the patients. The most common HPV type in all samples was HPV16, followed by HPV18. The existence of HPV16 DNA and low HPV16 viral load in cervical lesions were also significantly associated with disease recurrence. Furthermore, lymphovascular space involvement was also correlated with worse disease outcome.Conclusions: HPV16 DNA presence and low viral load in primary lesions can be used to predict disease recurrence. HPV DNA is a favorable prognostic indicator in patients with uterine cervical neoplasms who have lymphatic metastases.

TI  - Evidence of high N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates in the temperate northeast Atlantic
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Diazotrophic activity and primary production (PP) were investigated along two transects (Belgica BG2014/14 and GEOVIDE cruises) off the western Iberian Margin and the Bay of Biscay in May 2014. Substantial N-2 fixation activity was observed at 8 of the 10 stations sampled, ranging overall from 81 to 384 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1) (0.7 to 8.2 nmol N L-1 d(-1)), with two sites close to the Iberian Margin situated between 38.8 and 40.7 degrees N yielding rates reaching up to 1355 and 1533 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1). Primary production was relatively lower along the Iberian Margin, with rates ranging from 33 to 59 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), while it increased towards the northwest away from the peninsula, reaching as high as 135 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). In agreement with the area-averaged Chl a satellite data contemporaneous with our study period, our results revealed that post-bloom conditions prevailed at most sites, while at the northwesternmost station the bloom was still ongoing. When converted to carbon uptake using Redfield stoichiometry, N-2 fixation could support 1% to 3% of daily PP in the euphotic layer at most sites, except at the two most active sites where this contribution to daily PP could reach up to 25 %. At the two sites where N-2 fixation activity was the highest, the prymnesiophyte-symbiont Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa (UCYN-A) dominated the nifH sequence pool, while the remaining recovered sequences belonged to non-cyanobacterial phylotypes. At all the other sites, however, the recovered nifH sequences were exclusively assigned phylogenetically to non-cyanobacterial phylotypes. The intense N-2 fixation activities recorded at the time of our study were likely promoted by the availability of phytoplankton-derived organic matter produced during the spring bloom, as evidenced by the significant surface particulate organic carbon concentrations. Also, the presence of excess phosphorus signature in surface waters seemed to contribute to sustaining N-2 fixation, particularly at the sites with extreme activities. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of the unexpectedly high N-2 fixation in productive waters of the temperate North Atlantic and highlight the importance of N-2 fixation for future assessment of the global N inventory.

TI  - A multi-collocation method for coastal zone observations with applications to Sentinel-3A altimeter wave height data
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In many coastal areas there is an increasing number and variety of observation data available, which are often very heterogeneous in their temporal and spatial sampling characteristics. With the advent of new systems, like the radar altimeter on board the Sentinel-3A satellite, a lot of questions arise concerning the accuracy and added value of different instruments and numerical models. Quantification of errors is a key factor for applications, like data assimilation and forecast improvement. In the past, the triple collocation method to estimate systematic and stochastic errors of measurements and numerical models was successfully applied to different data sets. This method relies on the assumption that three independent data sets provide estimates of the same quantity. In coastal areas with strong gradients even small distances between measurements can lead to larger differences and this assumption can become critical. In this study the triple collocation method is extended in different ways with the specific problems of the coast in mind. In addition to nearest-neighbour approximations considered so far, the presented method allows for use of a large variety of interpolation approaches to take spatial variations in the observed area into account. Observation and numerical model errors can therefore be estimated, even if the distance between the different data sources is too large to assume that they measure the same quantity. If the number of observations is sufficient, the method can also be used to estimate error correlations between certain data source components. As a second novelty, an estimator for the uncertainty in the derived observation errors is derived as a function of the covariance matrices of the input data and the number of available samples.In the first step, the method is assessed using synthetic observations and Monte Carlo simulations. The technique is then applied to a data set of Sentinel-3A altimeter measure-ments, in situ wave observations, and numerical wave model data with a focus on the North Sea. Stochastic observation errors for the significant wave height, as well as bias and calibration errors, are derived for the model and the altimeter. The analysis indicates a slight overestimation of altimeter wave heights, which become more pronounced at higher sea states. The smallest stochastic errors are found for the in situ measurements.Different observation geometries of in situ data and altimeter tracks are furthermore analysed, considering 1-D and 2-D interpolation approaches. For example, the geometry of an altimeter track passing between two in situ wave instruments is considered with model data being available at the in situ locations. It is shown that for a sufficiently large sample, the errors of all data sources, as well as the error correlations of the model, can be estimated with the new method.

TI  - Trends in global tropospheric ozone inferred from a composite record of TOMS/OMI/MLS/OMPS satellite measurements and the MERRA-2 GMI simulation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Past studies have suggested that ozone in the troposphere has increased globally throughout much of the 20th century due to increases in anthropogenic emissions and transport. We show, by combining satellite measurements with a chemical transport model, that during the last four decades tropospheric ozone does indeed indicate increases that are global in nature, yet still highly regional. Satellite ozone measurements from Nimbus-7 and Earth Probe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) are merged with ozone measurements from the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument/Microwave Limb Sounder (OMI/MLS) to determine trends in tropospheric ozone for 1979-2016. Both TOMS (1979-2005) and OMI/MLS (2005-2016) depict large increases in tropospheric ozone from the Near East to India and East Asia and further eastward over the Pacific Ocean. The 38-year merged satellite record shows total net change over this region of about + 6 to +7 Dobson units (DU) (i.e., similar to 15 %-20 % of average background ozone), with the largest increase (similar to 4 DU) occurring during the 2005-2016 Aura period. The Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) chemical transport model with time-varying emissions is used to aid in the interpretation of tropospheric ozone trends for 1980-2016. The GMI simulation for the combined record also depicts the greatest increases of +6 to +7 DU over India and East Asia, very similar to the satellite measurements. In regions of significant increases in tropospheric column ozone (TCO) the trends are a factor of 2-2.5 larger for the Aura record when compared to the earlier TOMS record; for India and East Asia the trends in TCO for both GMI and satellite measurements are similar to +3 DU decade(-1) or greater during 2005-2016 compared to about +1.2 to +1.4 DU decade(-1) for 1979-2005. The GMI simulation and satellite data also reveal a tropospheric ozone increases in similar to +4 to +5 DU for the 38-year record over central Africa and the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Both the GMI simulation and satellite measured tropospheric ozone during the latter Aura time period show increases of similar to +3 DU decade(-1) over the N Atlantic and NE Pacific.

TI  - The alpine flora on inselberg summits in the Maloti-Drakensberg Park, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - BOTHALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Inselberg summits adjacent to the Maloti-Drakensberg escarpment occupy an alpine zone within the Drakensberg Alpine Centre (DAC). Inselbergs, the escarpment and surrounding mountains such as Platberg experience a severe climate; inselberg summits are distinct by being protected from human disturbance.Objectives: The aim of this article was to describe for the first time the flora of inselberg summits and to assess their potential contribution to conservation of DAC plant diversity.Method: We investigated whether the flora of inselberg summits formed a representative subset of the DAC flora in terms of shared, especially endemic or near endemic, species and representation of families. All species were listed for six inselbergs between Giant's Castle and Sentinel, located in the Royal Natal National Park (RNNP) during November 2005. Comparisons, using literature, were made with floras of the DAC, as well as Platberg, an inselberg approximately 60 km north from Sentinel in the RNNP.Results: We recorded 200 species of pteridophytes and angiosperms on inselbergs, 114 DAC endemics or near endemics, one possible new species, and several range and altitudinal extensions. Asteraceae, Poaceae and Ericaceae comprised 42.1% of endemic and near endemic species, with Scrophulariaceae and Hyacinthaceae contributing 8.8%. Inselberg and DAC floras differed in respective rankings of Crassulaceae (8th vs. > 15th), Polygalaceae, Apiaceae and Rosaceae (10th, 11th, 12th vs. > 15th), Poaceae (2nd vs. 5th), Cyperaceae (3rd vs. 4th) and Scrophulariaceae (6th vs. 2nd). Growth forms on inselbergs were consistent with DAC flora. Inselbergs shared 40% of species with Platberg.Conclusion: Inselbergs, which supported 7.9% of species occurring in the DAC flora, are well protected from human impact, lack alien plants, but, despite this, are highly vulnerable to climate change. Conservation importance of inselbergs will increase as escarpment vegetation becomes increasingly degraded as a consequence of intensifying land use.

TI  - Sentinel-1 for Monitoring Land Subsidence of Coastal Cities in Africa Using PSInSAR: A Methodology Based on the Integration of SNAP and StaMPS
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The sub-Saharan African coast is experiencing fast-growing urbanization, particularly around major cities. This threatens the equilibrium of the socio-ecosystems where they are located and on which they depend: underground water resources are exploited with a disregard for sustainability; land is reclaimed from wetlands or lagoons; built-up areas, both formal and informal, grow without adequate urban planning. Together, all these forces can result in land surface deformation, subsidence or even uplift, which can increase risk within these already fragile socio-ecosystems. In particular, in the case of land subsidence, the risk of urban flooding can increase significantly, also considering the contribution of sea level rise driven by climate change. Monitoring such fast-changing environments is crucial to be able to identify key risks and plan adaptation responses to mitigate current and future flood risks. Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful tool to monitor land deformation with high precision using relatively low-cost technology, also thanks to the open access data of Sentinel-1, which provides global observations every 6 days at 20-m ground resolution. In this paper, we demonstrate how it is possible to monitor land subsidence in urban coastal areas by means of permanent scatterer interferometry and Sentinel-1, exploiting an automatic procedure based on an integration of the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS). We present the results of PSI analysis over the cities of Banjul (the Gambia) and Lagos (Nigeria) showing a comparison of results obtained with TerraSAR-X, Constellation of Small Satellites for the Mediterranean Basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) and Environmental Satellite advanced synthetic aperture radar (Envisat-ASAR) data. The methodology allows us to highlight areas of high land deformation, information that is useful for urban development, disaster risk management and climate adaptation planning.

TI  - Residential green space in childhood is associated with lower risk of psychiatric disorders from adolescence into adulthood
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban residence is associated with a higher risk of some psychiatric disorders, but the underlying drivers remain unknown. There is increasing evidence that the level of exposure to natural environments impacts mental health, but few large-scale epidemiological studies have assessed the general existence and importance of such associations. Here, we investigate the prospective association between green space and mental health in the Danish population. Green space presence was assessed at the individual level using high-resolution satellite data to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index within a 210 x 210 m square around each person's place of residence (similar to 1 million people) from birth to the age of 10. We show that high levels of green space presence during childhood are associated with lower risk of a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders later in life. Risk for subsequent mental illness for those who lived with the lowest level of green space during childhood was up to 55% higher across various disorders compared with those who lived with the highest level of green space. The association remained even after adjusting for urbanization, socioeconomic factors, parental history of mental illness, and parental age. Stronger association of cumulative green space presence during childhood compared with single-year green space presence suggests that presence throughout childhood is important. Our results show that green space during childhood is associated with better mental health, supporting efforts to better integrate natural environments into urban planning and childhood life.

TI  - Health monitoring during water scarcity in Mayotte, France, 2017
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundDuring the 2016-2017 austral summer, unprecedented water scarcity was observed in the south of Mayotte, French island in the Indian Ocean. Therefore, authorities introduced restrictive measures to save the water of this part of the island. The rationing system affected over 65,000 people, for four months. In order to detect a possible deterioration of the health situation, a strengthened epidemiological surveillance system was set up.MethodsSurveillance focused on intestinal and skin diseases, which are often associated with a lack of hygiene or poor-quality drinking and bathing water. Three pathologies were monitored: acute diarrhoea, acute gastroenteritis and skin diseases and also, proportion of antidiarrhoeal and rehydration solutions sales in pharmacies. Cases of leptospirosis were also under surveillance. The analyses consisted of comparing the collected data according to the areas that were either affected or not affected by the water restrictions. Comparisons with historical data were also made.ResultsAlthough none of the surveillance systems were able to demonstrate any impact on skin diseases, they revealed a very sharp increase in the proportion of consultations for acute diarrhoea and gastro-enteritis in the southern area. This was corroborated by a high increase in the sales of antidiarrhoeals and oral rehydration solutions via the sentinel pharmacists in the south of the island compared with those of the north. Comparison with historical data highlighted the occurrence of an unusual situation.ConclusionThese water restrictions caused a real deterioration in the health status of the inhabitants who were deprived of water.

T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW D
M3  - Article
AB  - We consider the gravitational Wilsonian effective action at low energy when all the particles of the standard model have decoupled. When the R-2 terms dominate, the theory is equivalent to a scalar-tensor theory with the universal coupling beta = 1/root 6 to matter for which we present strong lower and upper bounds on the scalaron mass m obtained by using results from the Eot-Wash experiment on the modification of the inverse-square law, the observations of the hot gas of galaxy clusters, and the Planck satellite data on the neutrino masses. In terms of the range of the scalar interaction mediated over a distance of order m(-1), this leads to the small interval 4 mu m less than or similar to m(-1 )less than or similar to( )68 mu m within reach of future experimental tests of deviations from Newton's gravitational inverse-square law.

TI  - High Resolution Satellite Images for Instantaneous Shoreline Extraction Using New Enhancement Algorithms
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of a territory is an essential element in any future planning action and in appropriate territorial and environmental requalification action planning. The current large-scale availability of satellite data, thanks to very high resolution images, provides professional users in the environmental, urban planning, engineering, and territorial government sectors, in general, with large amounts of useful data with which to monitor the territory and cultural heritage. Italy is experiencing environmental emergencies, and coastal erosion is one of the greatest threats, not only to the Italian heritage and economy, but also to human life. The aim of this paper is to find a rapid way of identifying the instantaneous shoreline. This possibility could help government institutions such as regions, civil protection, etc., to analyze large areas of land quickly. The focus is on instantaneous shoreline extraction in Ortona (CH, Italy), without considering tides, using WorldView-2 satellite images (50-cm resolution in panchromatic and 2 m in multispectral). In particular, the main purpose of this paper is to compare commercial software and ACM filters to test their effectiveness.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Greater exposure to environmental microorganisms has been hypothesized to reduce the likelihood of developing autoimmune disorders, and vegetation is known to be a source of diverse microbiota to the air. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of airborne microbial communities in urban environments with varying amounts and types of vegetation are poorly understood. In this study we used high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to assess whether fine-scale variation in urban vegetation influences the diversity, composition, or structure of airborne bacterial communities over time. We used passive settling dishes to collect airborne bacteria from 36 sites representing three urban land cover types (forest, grassland, paved) over a 3-month period in Eugene-Springfield, Oregon, USA. We used remote sensing data (aerial 4-band orthoimagery and LiDAR) and geographic information systems (GIS) to assess detailed site characteristics (e.g., total vegetation cover and structural diversity) for each site. Our initial analysis indicated that site was the most important factor explaining variation in bacterial community structure (R-2 = 0.32, p < 0.001), followed by sampling date (R-2 = 0.24, p < 0.001), while land cover type was a significant but weak predictor (R-2 = 0.06, p < 0.001) and other vegetation metrics were even less predictive. However, when samples were analyzed separately by date, the explanatory power of land cover type increased substantially; six of nine dates showed significant effects (p < 0.05) with R-2 ranging from 0.16-0.31, indicating that land cover type had a marked influence on bacterial community structure that was obscured by the effects of site and sampling date. Despite the importance of site as a predictor of bacterial community structure, Mantel tests for spatial correlation were insignificant for most sampling dates, suggesting that localized site characteristics were driving this relationship. We use our results to propose a space-time conceptual model of the interactions between site-scale environmental features (e.g., vegetation characteristics) and regional-scale temporal processes and events (e.g., agricultural harvesting) to understand and perhaps manage intraurban airborne bacterial communities.

TI  - Intercomparison and Validation of Satellite and Ground-Based Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) Retrievals over Six AERONET Sites in West Africa
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geographical and climatic conditions of West Africa make the region an essential area for the description of atmospheric aerosol optical properties across the globe. This study provides an intercomparison of aerosol optical depth (AOD440nm) retrievals from satellite-based CALIPSO, MISR, MODIS and OMI sensors against ground-based sun photometer (AERONET) measurements between 2004 and 2014 from six West African sites, which are Agoufou, Banizoumbou, Ouagadougou, Dakar, Djougou and Ilorin during the period 2004-2014. The analysis revealed that MODISSTD performed better with a high degree of correlation for the six study sites, the CALIPSO and MISR-AERONET comparisons showed strong correlations, and the MODISDB also indicated better correlations, as did the OMI-AERONET comparisons. The root mean square error, mean absolute error and root mean bias error were also computed. The CALIPSO instrument has the lowest RMSE and MAE values over Dakar, while the highest RMSE and MAE values were indicated by the CALIPSO and MODISDB sensors, respectively, over Ilorin. The MISR instrument showed good agreement over Dakar than the other instruments, while CALIPSO AOD retrievals were better than those from the other sensors in Banizoumbou and Ouagadogou. The expected error bounds computed for both MODIS retrievals showed that MODISSTD consistently outperformed MODISDB in all the study sites. High AOD values were averagely observed by the satellite sensors during the local dry months (December-February), due to high concentrations of dust aerosols. High AOD values were observed during March-May, due to the condensation of water vapor on aerosol leading to increase in size and optical depth.

TI  - A PROSPECTIVE TRIAL COMPARING THE ACCURACY BETWEEN ULTRASOUND GUIDED FNAC OF AXILLARY LYMPH NODES AND SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY USING METHYLENE BLUE FOLLOWED BY IMPRINT CYTOLOGY IN CLINICALLY NODE NEGATIVE EARLY BREAST CANCERS
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVOLUTION OF MEDICAL AND DENTAL SCIENCES-JEMDS
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDSurgical treatment of breast cancer has evolved from Halsted's radical mastectomy to breast conserving surgery. Similarly, surgical treatment of regional lymph nodes has also become less extensive. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was standard of care for a long time and considered necessary for loco-regional control as well as for staging purpose. While ALND came with substantial morbidity and the majority of the ALND patients were "node negative", various studies reported no effect of ALND on disease free and overall survival. In the mid-nineties the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was introduced for staging in breast cancer patients. Conceptually, the search for sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in cancer patients was not new. In 1959 Gould presented his results of SLNB in patients treated for cancer of the parotid(1) followed by a report describing the retrieval of SLNs in penile cancer. Two decades later Morton popularized the use of SLNB in melanoma patients. In 1994 it was Giuliano(2) , working in the same institute as Morton, who first described the use of the procedure in breast cancer patients. Nowadays this procedure is standard of care in clinically node negative breast cancer patients.MATERIALS AND METHODSFNA done after USG of breast and axilla followed by methylene blue injection. Blue nodes identified and harvested.RESULTSUltrasound evaluation of node done, and suspected nodes documented. Methylene blue dye injected nodes were harvested. FNAC evaluation and imprint cytology evaluation of nodes done and compared with histopathology findings.CONCLUSIONIn our study, using methylene blue dye gave high accuracy in evaluation of positive lymph nodes. Imprint cytology is a useful adjuvant and is less expensive method to identify positive nodes than frozen section.

TI  - Extraction of urban built-up areas from nighttime lights using artificial neural network
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of urban areas at the national and regional scales is critical for urban planners and governments to design sustainable and environment-friendly future development plans. The nighttime lights (NTL) data provide an effective way to monitor the urban at different scales however is usually achieved by using empirical threshold-based algorithms. This study proposed a novel Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach, using moderate resolution imageries as NTL, MODIS NDVI and land surface temperature data, to map urban areas. Both random and maximum dissimilarity distance algorithm sampling methods were considered and compared. The validation of the urban areas extracted from MDA-based ANN against the 2011 US national land cover data showed a reasonable quality (overall accuracy = 97.84; Kappa = 0.74) and achieved more accurate result than the threshold method. This study demonstrates that ANN can provide an effective, rapid, and accurate alternative in extracting urban built-up areas from NTL.

TI  - Could bovine livestock intensification in Pantanal be neutral regarding enteric methane emissions?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bovine livestock is a major anthropogenic greenhouse gas source via enteric methane. Brazilian bovine livestock is also responsible for emissions from land-use changes. In contrast, enteric emissions from extensive cattle systems in wetlands might have been overestimated. We provide scientific evidences that the human footprint of bovine products delivered by the Pantanal can be much lower. To assess this, a historical cloud-free imagery of the Landsat-5, spanning 26 years, were processed for mapping spatiotemporal landscapes in a Pantanal farm under cattle intensification studies. Eight landscape categories were identified according to spatiotemporal dynamics of interannual floods. The spatiotemporal map allowed in the field the adoption of stratified random samplings of chamber gas fluxes. The combination of stratified sampled landscapes with Monte Carlo simulations of measured methane emissions in wet and dry soils permitted to integrate landscapes emissions at annual basis with biased uncertainties. Assuming enteric emissions obtained for the Pantanal region, our results suggest that the landscapes methane emissions are 10- to 23-fold superior than the enteric emissions of traditional bovine systems. While enteric emissions seem negligible with respect to net farmland emissions, cattle livestock provide important environmental services like carbon recycling through non-competing herbivory. Moreover, cattle might be making use of a biomass that would undergo decomposition during the flooding phase. Our analysis thus indicate that enteric emissions from traditional bovine systems in flooding farmlands could be considered neutral. By contrast, intensification to improve the stocking rate should be accounted as net anthropogenic emissions. A case study of intensification allowed an increase of 48% in the stocking rate, which is associated with net anthropogenic emissions from 534 bovine animals or about 27 to 63 Mg of enteric CH4 per year. In short, the competition between traditional and distinct levels of cattle intensification will result from a trade-off between public policies and strategic market niches (organic, sustainable) for the optimal landscape management of the Pantanal.

TI  - Land use change, urbanization, and change in landscape pattern in a metropolitan area
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes land use change, urbanization and their impact on the change in landscape pattern in Tabriz metropolitan area (TMA) during the time period from 1996 to 2016 in order to provide support sustainable regional planning. For this purpose, land use data obtained from satellite images including Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors for 1996, 2006, and 2016 with 30 x 30 m spatial resolution. This paper first seeks to analyze the changes in land use and urbanization, followed by changes in landscape patterns by using spatial metrics and Landscape Expansion Index (LEI). Then, using two methods of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), magnitude and direction of the relationship between land use changes, urbanization, and change in landscape patterns are analyzed. The findings show that most ecological lands such as grasslands have been converted into bare and urban lands over the past two decades. Therefore, in the whole landscape, the expansion of urbanization has led to the prevailing pattern, resulting in increased fragmentation and reduced aggregation. The results also show that changes in landscape patterns have a strong relationship with changes in various land uses. In addition, GWR analysis was used to analyze the impact of urbanization on changes in landscape patterns, indicating that urbanization expansion has different effects with changes in spatial positions, so that in areas adjacent to the built-up lands and the central regions of TMA, with increasing urbanization, we see increasing aggregation in the landscape, but as we move away from the built-up areas, are faced with an increase in fragmentation and heterogeneity, especially in the northeastern, south and southwest areas of TMR.

TI  - Impact of Cartosat-1 orography in 330 m Unified Model forecast
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The newly introduced high-resolution (330 m) regional model, Delhi Model (DM), at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting targets winter time fog/visibility forecast over Delhi, India. The present study focuses on the benefits of enhanced orographic features in DM, through a new data set developed using the Indian Space Research Organisation Cartosat-1 orography (Cartosat-run), against those from the NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model employed previously (SRTM-run). The early morning visibilities from the Cartosat-runs were lower compared to the SRTM-runs, which could be linked to an enhanced downdraft (negative vertical velocity) in the former, helping form a shallow and stratified boundary layer. The evolution and variability of 'ventilation index' in the model domain is regulated by the local wind circulation changes within the shallow boundary layer which in turn is modulated by the orography representation. The DM forecasted ventilation index has been projected to be a potential indicator of the atmosphere dispersion of airborne pollutants over Delhi.

TI  - Ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> and their combined effects on prevalence of presbyopia among the elderly: A cross-sectional study in six low- and middle-income countries
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Ambient air pollutant directly contacts with the eyes, however, the effect of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) on vision impairment, such as presbyopia, has been kept largely unknown.Methods: We surveyed a total of 36,620 participants aged 50 years and above in six low- and middle-income countries. Ambient annual concentrations of PM2.5 and O-3 for the residential community were estimated using satellite data and chemical transport model. A mixed effects model was utilized to assess the effects of ambient PM2.5 and O-3 on presbyopia, as well as their combined effects.Results: A total of 13,841 presbyopia cases were identified among the participants with a prevalence rate of 41.17%. For both PM2.5 and O-3, we found a J-shaped exposure-response relationship with the threshold being identified at 15 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5 and 55 mu g/m(3) for O-3. The odds ratio (OR) of presbyopia was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.21) for each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 above 15 mu g/m(3) and 1.37 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.54) for O-3 above 55 mu g/m(3) after adjusting for various potential confounding factors. There appeared to be a synergistic interaction between ambient PM2.5 and O-3 on presbyopia in the additive model, the combined effect was significantly larger than the sum of their individual effects, with a synergistic index of 2.39.Conclusion: This study supports that exposures to ambient PM2.5 and O-3 might be important risk factors of presbyopia among old adults, and simultaneously exposure to high level of the two pollutants could intensify their individual effects.

TI  - Desegregation of remote sensing and GIS to characterize fluctuations in the surface water area of Afar Lakes, Ethiopia
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water reservoirs in Afar play an imperative role in water resource economics in Ethiopia. Salt mining, fishing, and recreation are the major practices in Afar lakes. However, Ethiopia is prone to seismic, volcanic, and drought hazards due to its geologic setting and geographic location. This study incorporates remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to investigate oscillations in the surface water area in Afar lakes during 1998-2016. In this investigation, a GIS density slicer technique is employed to classify the near infrared bands from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, and then a time series of Landsat measurements has been created to monitor the spatio-temporal variations in each lake. Ultimately, the relationship between lake area changes and seismic, magmatic, and climatic records has been examined. Change patterns and rates indicate that all Afar lakes are influenced notably by climate factors and are not affected by local seismic and magmatic activities.

TI  - Cloud Detection of ZY-3 Satellite Remote Sensing Images Based on Improved Fully Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for cloud detection of ZY-3 satellite remote sensing images is proposed based on improved deep learning fully convolutional neural network. In pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, full convolution layer is used instead of full connection layer, and deconvolution method is used to up-sample feature map to optimize and improve network structure, then the Adam gradient descent method is adopted to accelerate convergence. The network is trained by using the resource image database of ZY-3 satellite, and the up-sampled image features are input into the Sigmoid classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than the traditional methods in terms of detection accuracy and speed. The accuracy achieves 90.11%, and detection time can be reduced to 0.46 s.

TI  - Does Wide Excisional Biopsy in Skin Cancer Prevent Finding The Real Sentinel Lymph Node?
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose/Aim: The presence of nodal metastasis is an important prognostic factor for malignant melanoma and causes a 50% decrease in survival. Patients found not to have lymph node metastasis as a result of sentinel lymph node biopsy but develop regional lymph node metastasis in the follow-up period are called false negative sentinel. The hypothesis of this study was that excisional biopsy in patients with large lesions may change the lymphatic pathway and therefore cause false negative results. Materials & Methods: A total of 40 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: the control group, Group 1 (10 mm excision), Group 2 (15 mm lesion excision), and Group 3 (20 mm excision). Sentinel lymph nodes were found via imaging with nanocolloidal albumin including 99mTc and indocyanine green (ICG) before the excision and at 3 weeks after the excision. Evaluations were performed to determine whether or not they were the same nodes. Results: The false sentinel node detection rate in Group 3 was significantly higher than in both the control group and Group 1 (p < 0.05). No significant difference was detected between Group 2 and 3 according to false sentinel node detection rate. There were differences between preoperative and postoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes found by radioactive and ICG methods but no significant difference was detected in the Kappa agreement coefficient. Conclusion: It can be suggested that incisional biopsy is performed on large lesions initially, followed by wide excision combined with SLNB at the second stage. This can help to prevent changes in the lymphatic pathway and therefore to decrease false negativity rates caused by the previous surgery.

TI  - L-band SAR for estimating aboveground biomass of rubber plantation in Java Island, Indonesia
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses an experiment on the estimation of rubber tree biomass using L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), to support recent efforts to include trees outside forest in global biomass and carbon accounting. We noted that date of acquisition is important, but certainly the selection of allometric equation serving as the reference data was paramount. Similarly, choosing a proper form of fully polarimetric data was instrumental, although this requires validation in different environmental settings. As expected, modern data mining approaches consistently delivered high accuracy. Extreme learning machine yielded the best estimate in terms of R-2 (0.98) and RMSE (1.88 Mg/ha); nonetheless, it also delivered a slight negative estimation. In this case, we found that a variant of random forest produced an outcome without any negative estimation. This research suggests that estimated biomass or carbon information from rubber plantations would be an invaluable candidate for the improvement of global biomass data.

TI  - Stellar Image Denoising Method for Active Pixel Sensor Based on Dynamic Sequential Noise Template
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A stellar image denoising method for active pixel sensor (APS) based on dynamic sequential noise template is proposed. In this method, a dynamic sequential noise template is constructed based on the short-term static background noise and the random noise threshold, which is used to realize the denoising treatment of APS stellar images. The original APS stellar image of the ZY-3 is used as the test data and the research results show that the proposed method can eliminate strip and edge noises very well. Compared with the traditional denoising method, the proposed method can improve the extraction accuracy of the stellar image centroid by approximately 12. 98 ''. Compared with the global threshold segmentation method, the proposed method can improve the extraction accuracy by about 2. 16 ''. Compared with the static background noise method, the proposed method can improve the extraction accuracy by around 9. 61 ''. These fully indicate that the proposed method can effectively improve the positioning accuracy of APS stellar centroid and can be used in attitude post-processing.

TI  - National PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> exposure models for China based on land use regression, satellite measurements, and universal kriging
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Outdoor air pollution is a major killer worldwide and the fourth largest contributor to the burden of disease in China. China is the most populous country in the world and also has the largest number of air pollution deaths per year, yet the spatial resolution of existing national air pollution estimates for China is generally relatively low. We address this knowledge gap by developing and evaluating national empirical models for China incorporating land-use regression (LUR), satellite measurements, and universal kriging (UK). Land use, traffic and meteorological variables were included for model building. We tested the resulting models in several ways, including (1) comparing models developed using forward variable selection vs. partial least squares (PLS) variable reduction, (2) comparing models developed with and without satellite measurements, and with and without UK, and (3) 10-fold cross-validation (CV), Leave-One-Province-Out CV (LOPO-CV), and Leave-One-City-Out CV (LOCO-CV). Satellite data and kriging are complementary in making predictions more accurate: kriging improved the models in well-sampled areas; satellite data substantially improved performance at locations far away from monitors. Variable-selection models performed similarly to PLS models in 10-fold CV, but better in LOPO-CV. Our best models employed forward variable selection and UK, with 10-fold CV R-2 of 0.89 (for both 2014 and 2015) for PM2.5 and of 0.73 (year-2014) and 0.78 (year-2015) for NO2. Population-weighted concentrations during 2014-2015 decreased for PM2.5 (58.7 mu g/m(3) to 52.3 mu g/m(3)) and NO2 (29.6 mu g/m(3) to 26.8 mu g/m(3)). We produced the first high resolution national LUR models for annual-average concentrations in China. Models were applied on 1 km grid to support future research. In 2015, >80% of the Chinese population lived in areas that exceeded the Chinese national PM2.5 standard, 35 mu g/m(3). Results here will be publicly available and may be useful for epidemiology, risk assessment, and environmental justice research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The footprint of urban heat island effect in 302 Chinese cities: Temporal trends and associated factors
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect has been a concern for decades due its adverse influence on energy consumption, air and water quality, and, most importantly, the health of urban dwellers. Researchers have paid much attention to the magnitude of the UHI effect, but ignored its spatial extent (i.e. footprint) which is another important aspect of the UHI effect. In this study, we systematically analyzed the footprint of surface UHI (SUHI) effect in 302 Chinese cities, especially temporal trends of the footprint, by using multi-source remote sensing data. The footprint of SUHI effect (FP) was estimated by the Gaussian surface, and its temporal trend was examined by the Mann-Kendal and the Sen's slope estimator non-parametric tests. We found the FP showed evident diurnal (daytime > nighttime), seasonal (summer > winter) and inter-city (big cities > small and medium-sized cities) differences. During the period 2003-2016, over 80% of the 302 cities exhibited increasing trends of the FP in annual days and summer days, and the increasing trends were statistically significant (p < 0.05) in about half of these cities. In the nights, the FP increased in more than 70% of the cities, and about one-third of the 302 cities experienced significantly increasing trends of the FP. On average, the annual daytime and annual nighttime FPs increased at a rate of 5.0% per year and 3.8% per year, respectively. More importantly, the correlation analysis indicated that the increase of anthropogenic heat emissions and the decrease of vegetation activities and surface albedos should take lead responsibility for the expansion of the FP in the urbanization process. These results reveal that the spatial extent of heat island effect has expanded significantly in numerous Chinese cities, and this increasing trend will be sustained in the coming years if no more effective measures are carried out.

TI  - Landuse and land cover identification and disaggregating socio-economic data with convolutional neural network
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We demonstrated an innovative learning method of convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify landuse and land cover (LULC) patterns and extract features to disaggregate socio-economic factors by using remote sensing imageries at 30 m spatial resolution. The training labels were extracted from the historical LULC map to reduce the huge cost of labelling work, and to provide an inaccuracy but sufficient training dataset. The fully connected layer of the trained CNN was extracted as disaggregating features to map socio-economic factors of population and gross domestic product (GDP). Results indicate that current method can attain 92% overall agreement of LULC identification with the cross-validation of other products. The determination coefficient of disaggregating socio-economic factors can reach 0.945 for population density, and 0.876 for GDP density with the cross-validation at county level.

TI  - A constructive review of the State Forest Inventory in the Russian Federation
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - The State Forest Inventory (SFI) in the Russian Federation is a relatively new project that is little known in the English-language scientific literature. Following the stipulations of the Forest Act of 2006, the first SFI sample plots in this vast territory were established in 2007. The 34 Russian forest regions were the basic geographical units for all statistical estimates and served as a first-level stratification, while a second level was based on old inventory data and remotely sensed data. The sampling design was to consist of a simple random sample of 84,700 circular 500m(2) sample plots over forest land. Each sample plot consists of three nested concentric circular subplots with radii of 12.62, 5.64 and 2.82m and additional subplots for assessing and describing undergrowth, regeneration and ground vegetation. In total, 117 variables were to be measured or assessed on each plot.Although field work has begun, the methodology has elicited some criticism. The simple random sampling design is less efficient than a systematic design featuring sample plot clusters and a mix of temporary and permanent plots. The second-level stratification is mostly ineffective for increasing precision. Qualitative variables, which are not always essential, are dominant, while important quantitative variables are under-represented. Because of very slow progress, in 2018 the original plan was adjusted by reducing the number of permanent sample plots from 84,700 to 68,287 so that the first SFI cycle could be completed by 2020.

This study integrates remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies to investigate the impact of drought on 10 selected surface water reservoirs in San Angelo and Dallas, Texas. Oscillations in summer and winter months throughout the 2005-2016 period were assessed using multispectral images from Landsat-5, -7, and -8, and changes in the reservoirs were characterized and correlated against local climate data of each reservoir. For quantitative comparisons of the time-series measurements, a robust density slicing approach was employed to classify the range of values of the raster cells in the near-infrared band of Landsat images for each lake into three desired classes (deep water, shallow water, and dry area) based on the natural breaks inherent in the dataset. Statistical analysis shows that the overall accuracy of the classification is about 94%, which demonstrates the efficiency of the density slicer to accurately estimate surface water area changes from an individual Landsat band. Shrinkage in the surface water area over the study period reveals the concrete impact that the drought along with other factors have on the 10 selected lakes. The San Angelo lakes located in west central Texas experienced a nearly consistent pattern of change during most of the study period; whereas the Dallas lakes in northeast Texas followed the oscillating pattern of drought and correlated closely to the local conditions. Shockingly, the extreme drought caused complete vanishing of several lakes, and consequently Texas had to remove them from its recreational plans. Our new findings can certainly help with the water resource management in Texas and our study approach can be adapted for monitoring lake oscillations in other areas across the world. This geospatial study demonstrates the societal benefits from incorporating remote sensing and GIS in investigating geo-environmental problems associated with severe climate changes.

TI  - Determinants of bed net use conditional on access in population surveys in Ghana
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInsecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are one of the most effective and widely available methods for preventing malaria, and there is interest in understanding the complexities of behavioural drivers of non-use among those with access. This analysis evaluated net use behaviour in Ghana by exploring how several household and environmental variables relate to use among Ghanaians with access to a net.MethodsSurvey data from the Ghana 2014 Demographic and Health Survey and the 2016 Malaria Indicator Survey were used to calculate household members' access to space under a net as well as the proportion of net use conditional on access (NUCA). Geospatial information on cluster location was obtained, as well as average humidex, a measure of how hot it feels, for the month each cluster was surveyed. The relationship between independent variables and net use was assessed via beta-binomial regression models that controlled for spatially correlated random effects using non-Gaussian kriging.ResultsIn both surveys, increasing wealth was associated with decreased net use among those with access in households when compared to the poorest category. In 2014, exposure to messages about bed net use for malaria prevention was associated with increased net use (OR 2.5, 95% CrI 1.5-4.2), as was living in a rural area in both 2014 (OR 2.5, 95% CrI 1.5-4.3) and 2016 (OR 1.6, 95% CrI 1.1-2.3). The number of nets per person was not associated with net use in either survey. Model fit was improved for both surveys by including a spatial random effect for cluster, demonstrating some spatial autocorrelation in the proportion of people using a net. Humidex, electricity in the household and IRS were not associated with NUCA.ConclusionNet use conditional on access is affected by household characteristics and is also spatially-dependent in Ghana. Setting (whether the household was urban or rural) plays a role, with wealthier and more urban households less likely to use nets when they are available. It will likely be necessary in the future to focus on rural settings, urban settings, and wealth status independently, both to better understand predictors of household net use in these areas and to design more targeted interventions to ensure consistent use of vector control interventions that meet specific needs of the population.

TI  - Investigation of Aerosol Properties and Structures in Two Representative Meteorological Situations over the Vipava Valley Using Polarization Raman LiDAR
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vipava valley in Slovenia is a representative hot-spot for complex mixtures of different aerosol types of both anthropogenic and natural origin. Aerosol loading distributions and optical properties were investigated using a two-wavelength polarization Raman LiDAR, which provided extinction coefficient, backscatter coefficient, depolarization ratio, backscatter angstrom ngstrom exponent and LiDAR ratio profiles. Two different representative meteorological situations were investigated to explore the possibility of identifying aerosol types present in the valley. In the first case, we investigated the effect of strong downslope (Bora) wind on aerosol structures and characteristics. In addition to observing Kelvin-Helmholtz instability above the valley, at the height of the adjacent mountain ridge, we found new evidence for Bora-induced processes which inject soil dust aerosols into the free troposphere up to twice the height of the planetary boundary layer (PBL). In the second case, we investigated aerosol properties and distributions in stable weather conditions. From the observed stratified vertical aerosol structure and specific optical properties of different layers we identified predominant aerosol types in these layers.

TI  - Surveillance and characterisation of influenza viruses among patients with influenza-like illness in Bali, Indonesia, July 2010-June 2014
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAlthough Indonesia has high fatality rate of human A/H5N1 cases, epidemiological and clinical data on influenza virus circulation among humans has been limited. Within Indonesia, Bali province is of interest due to high population densities of humans, pigs and poultry. This study aims to characterize and compare the epidemiological and clinical patterns of influenza viruses in humans through surveillance among patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) in Bali, Indonesia.MethodsILI patients were recruited at 21 sentinel health facilities across all nine regencies in Bali, from July 2010 to June 2014. PCR-based assays were used for detection and subtyping of influenza viruses. Demographic, behavioural and clinical data were tested for associations with influenza using chi-squared tests and logistic regression.ResultsOf 2077 ILI patients, 291 (14.0%) tested positive for influenza A, 152 (7.3%) for influenza B, and 16 (0.77%) for both influenza A and B. Of the influenza A isolates, the majority 61.2% were A/H3N2, followed by A/H1N1-pdm09 (80; 26.1%). Two A/H5N1 were identified. Influenza positive rates were significantly higher during wet season months (28.3%), compared with the dry season (13.8%; (2)=61.1; df=1; p<0.0001). Clinical predictors for infection varied by virus type, with measured fever (38 degrees C) more strongly associated with influenza B (AOR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.39).ConclusionInfluenza circulates year-round among humans in Bali with higher activity during the wet season. High contact rates with poultry and pigs, along with influenza virus detection that could not be subtyped through conventional assays, highlight the need for molecular studies to characterize epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of influenza in this setting.

TI  - Application of the Fengyun 3 C GNSS occultation sounder for assessing the global ionospheric response to a magnetic storm event
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid advancement of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) occultation technology in recent years has made it one of the most advanced space-based remote sensing technologies of the 21st century. GNSS radio occultation has many advantages, including all-weather operation, global coverage, high vertical resolution, high precision, long-term stability, and self-calibration. Data products from GNSS occultation sounding can greatly enhance ionospheric observations and contribute to space weather monitoring, forecasting, modeling, and research. In this study, GNSS occultation sounder (GNOS) results from a radio occultation sounding payload aboard the Fengyun 3 C (FY3-C) satellite were compared with ground-based ionosonde observations. Correlation coefficients for peak electron density (NmF2) derived from GNOS Global Position System (GPS) and Beidou navigation system (BDS) products with ionosonde data were higher than 0.9, and standard deviations were less than 20 %. Global ionospheric effects of the strong magnetic storm event in March 2015 were analyzed using GNOS results supported by ionosonde observations. The magnetic storm caused a significant disturbance in NmF2 level. Suppressed daytime and nighttime NmF2 levels indicated mainly negative storm conditions. In two longitude section zones of geomagnetic inclination between 40 and 80 degrees, the results of average NmF2 observed by GNOS and ground-based ionosondes showed the same basic trends during the geomagnetic storm and confirmed the negative effect of this storm event on the ionosphere. The analysis demonstrates the reliability of the GNSS radio occultation sounding instrument GNOS aboard the FY3-C satellite and confirms the utility of ionosphere products from GNOS for statistical and event-specific ionospheric physical analyses. Future FY3 series satellites and increasing numbers of Beidou navigation satellites will provide increasing GNOS occultation data on the ionosphere, which will contribute to ionosphere research and forecasting applications.

TI  - Reduction of hospitalizations with diarrhea among children aged 0-5 years in Nouakchott, Mauritania, following the introduction of rotavirus vaccine
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Rotavirus vaccine was introduced in Mauritania in December 2014. We investigated hospitalizations with diarrhea during pre and post-vaccination periods among children aged 0-5 years in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania.Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of hospital admission registries from November 1st 2012 through October 31th 2017 at all referral hospitals in Nouakchott. We described admissions of children aged 0-5 years by diagnosis, data of admission, age and sex, and compared the proportion of all childhood hospitalizations with diarrhea before and after rotavirus vaccine introduction.Results: In total, 6552 (19%) of all 34,329 hospitalizations in 0-5 year-olds had diarrhea. Of these, 3523/16,952 (20.7%) were recorded during the pre-vaccine period, 1373/6897 (19.9%) during the transition period (November 2014-October 2015), and 1656/10,480 (15.8%) during the post-vaccination period. The proportion of all childhood hospitalizations with diarrhea during the pre-vaccine period was 22.6% among males and 18.7% among females. Approximately one third (32.3%) of hospitalizations with diarrhea occurred in children aged 6-11 months. During the post-vaccination period, the proportion of hospitalizations with diarrhea declined by 24%, and the highest reduction (74%) was observed in children aged 2 to 5 years (P < 0.001).Conclusions: The proportion of childhood hospitalizations with diarrhea in Nouakchott was reduced by about one fourth after introduction of rotavirus vaccination in Mauritania, indicating a major impact for public health for children in the capital city.

TI  - Prospectivity Mapping for Epithermal Deposits of Western Milos Using a Fuzzy Multi Criteria Evaluation Approach Parameterized by Airborne Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A Mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) approach using a GIS-based weighted linear combination implementation of a Multi-Criteria Evaluation approach utilising a fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process to elucidate expert knowledge has been implemented to analyse the spatial distribution of epithermal deposits on the Island of Milos, Greece and model their association with exploration evidence data with the aim of providing insights into the controls on ore deposition. An integrated field and Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (DAIS) hyperspectral and thermal multispectral airborne remote sensing dataset supported by field mapping and laboratory analyses, has been utilised to resolve hydrothermal alteration and parameterise the MPM. This study has highlighted the intimate spatial relationship between topographic highs and locations with high grade silicified alteration at a number of locations. The ability of high spatial resolution multispectral Thermal InfraRed (TIR) remote sensing imagery, integrated with topographic data, to resolve these silicified topographic highs provides an additional tool in the exploration of epithermal deposits. The spatial relationships between silicified lithocaps, high-grade altered rocks, faulting and topographic highs were utilised in the development of the MPM model. A close association between the modelled results and the hydrothermal alteration mapped in the field supports the accuracy of this MPM approach.

TI  - Influenza C virus in pre-school children with respiratory infections: retrospective analysis of data from the national influenza surveillance system in Germany, 2012 to 2014
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Recent data on influenza C virus indicate a possible higher clinical impact in specified patient populations than previously thought. Aim: We aimed to investigate influenza C virus circulation in Germany. Methods: A total of 1,588 samples from 0 to 4 year-old children presenting as outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection were analysed retrospectively. The samples represented a subset of all samples from the German national surveillance system for influenza in this age group in 2012-14. The presence of influenza C virus was investigated by real-time PCR. For positive samples, information on symptoms as well as other respiratory virus co-infections was considered. Retrieved influenza C viral sequences were phylogenetically characterised. Results: Influenza C viral RNA was detected in 20 (1.3% of) samples, including 16 during the 2012/13 season. The majority (18/20) of influenza C-positive patients had ILI according to the European Union definition, one patient had pneumonia. Viruses belonged to the C/Sao Paulo and C/Kanagawa lineages. Most (11/20) samples were co-infected with other respiratory viruses. Conclusion: Our data are the first on influenza C virus circulation in Germany and notably from a European national surveillance system. The low detection frequency and the identified virus variants confirm earlier observations outside a surveillance system. More virus detections during the 2012/13 season indicate a variable circulation intensity in the different years studied. Influenza C virus can be considered for ILI patients. Future studies addressing its clinical impact, especially in patients with severe disease are needed.

TI  - Combining Object-Based Image Analysis with Topographic Data for Landform Mapping: A Case Study in the Semi-Arid Chaco Ecosystem, Argentina
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an object-based approach to mapping a set of landforms located in the fluvio-eolian plain of Rio Dulce and alluvial plain of Rio Salado (Dry Chaco, Argentina), with two Landsat 8 images collected in summer and winter combined with topographic data. The research was conducted in two stages. The first stage focused on basic-spectral landform classifications where both pixel- and object-based image analyses were tested with five classification algorithms: Mahalanobis Distance (MD), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Maximum Likelihood (ML), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT). The results obtained indicate that object-based analyses clearly outperform pixel-based classifications, with an increase in accuracy of up to 35%. The second stage focused on advanced object-based derived variables with topographic ancillary data classifications. The combinations of variables were tested in order to obtain the most accurate map of landforms based on the most successful classifiers identified in the previous stage (ML, SVM and DT). The results indicate that DT is the most accurate classifier, exhibiting the highest overall accuracies with values greater than 72% in both the winter and summer images. Future work could combine both, the most appropriate methodologies and combinations of variables obtained in this study, with physico-chemical variables sampled to improve the classification of landforms and even of types of soil.

TI  - First-in-human clinical study of novel technique to diagnose malignant melanoma via thermal conductivity measurements
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that originates from melanocytes and, especially in the case of early-stage melanoma, is distributed adjacent to the epidermis and superficial dermis. Although early-stage melanoma can be distinguished from benign nevus via a dermoscopy, it is difficult to distinguish invasive melanoma in its early stages from in situ melanoma. Because invasive melanoma must undergo a sentinel lymph node biopsy to be diagnosed, a non-invasive method to detect the micro-invasion of early-stage melanoma is needed for dermato-oncologists. This paper proposes a novel quantitative melanoma identification method based on accurate measurements of thermal conductivity using a pen-shaped device. This method requires skin temperature data for one minute to determine the effective thermal conductivity of the skin, allowing it to distinguish melanoma lesions from healthy skin. Results suggest that effective thermal conductivity was negative for in situ melanoma. However, in accordance with tumour progression, effective thermal conductivity was larger in invasive melanoma. The proposed thermal conductivity measurement is a novel tool that detects the micro-invasion of melanoma.

TI  - Aerosol optical properties over Europe: an evaluation of the AQMEII Phase 3 simulations against satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main uncertainties regarding the estimation of changes in the Earth's energy budget are related to the role of atmospheric aerosols. These changes are caused by aerosol-radiation (ARIs) and aerosol-cloud interactions (ACIs), which heavily depend on aerosol properties. Since the 1980s, many international modeling initiatives have studied atmospheric aerosols and their climate effects. Phase 3 of the Air Quality Modelling Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII) focuses on evaluating and intercomparing regional and linked global/regional modeling systems by collaborating with the Task Force on the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution Phase 2 (HTAP2) initiative. Within this framework, the main aim of this work is the assessment of the representation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the Angstrom exponent (AE) in AQMEII Phase 3 simulations over Europe. The evaluation was made using remote-sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard the Terra and Aqua platforms, and the instruments belonging to the ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and the Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN). Overall, the skills of AQMEII simulations when representing AOD (mean absolute errors from 0.05 to 0.30) produced lower errors than for the AE (mean absolute errors from 0.30 to 1). Regardless of the models or the emissions used, models were skillful at representing the low and mean AOD values observed (below 0.5). However, high values (around 1.0) were overpredicted for biomass burning episodes, due to an underestimation in the common fires' emissions, and were overestimated for coarse particles - principally desert dust - related to the boundary conditions. Despite this behavior, the spatial and temporal variability of AOD was better represented by all the models than AE variability, which was strongly underestimated in all the simulations. Noticeably, the impact of the model selection when representing aerosol optical properties is higher than the use of different emission inventories. On the other hand, the influence of ARIs and ACIs has a little visible impact compared to the impact of the model used.

TI  - Tracking dengue virus type 1 genetic diversity during lineage replacement in an hyperendemic area in Colombia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a flavivirus responsible for the most common and burdensome arthropod-borne viral disease of humans[1]. DENV evolution has been extensively studied on broad geographic and time scales, using sequences from a single gene[2,3]. It is believed that DENV evolution in humans is dominated primarily by purifying selection due to the constraint of maintaining fitness in both humans and mosquitoes[4,5]. Few studies have explored DENV evolutionary dynamics using whole genome sequences, nor have they explored changes in viral diversity that occur during intra-epidemic periods. We used deep sequencing of the viral coding region to characterize DENV-1 evolution in a Colombian population sampled during two high-prevalence dengue seasons in which serotype dominance shifted. Our data demonstrate patterns of strain extinction and replacement within DENV-1 as its prevalence waned and DENV-3 became established. A comparison of whole-genome versus single-gene-based phylogenetic analyses highlights an important difference in evolutionary patterns. We report a trend of higher nonsynonymous to synonymous diversity ratios among non-structural (NS) genes, and statistically significantly higher values among these ratios in the NS1 gene after DENV-1 strain replacement. These results suggest that positive selection could be driving DENV evolution within individual communities. Signals of positive selection coming from distinct samples may be drowned out when combining multiple regions with differing patterns of endemic transmission as commonly done by large-scale geo-temporal assessments. Here, we frame our findings within a small, local transmission history which aids significance. Moreover, these data suggest that the NS1 gene, rather than the E gene, may be a target of positive selection, although not mutually exclusive, and potentially useful sentinel of adaptive changes at the population level.

TI  - Seasonal and Interannual Variation Characteristics of Low-Cloud Fraction in Different North Pacific Regions
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we use the long-term satellite data to investigate seasonal and interannual variation of low-cloud fraction (LCF) and the associated controlling factors over the eastern and western North Pacific. On the seasonal time scale, the enhanced LCF over the eastern North Pacific in summer is actively coupled with strong estimated inversion strength (EIS) and 700-hPa relative humidity, and the LCF over the western North Pacific in winter is large and mainly caused by increased sensible heat flux and tropospheric low-level cold advection. On the interannual time scale, the increased LCF over the eastern North Pacific in summer is associated with increased EIS and decreased sea surface temperatures, in which the El Nino plays an important role; the enhanced LCF over the western North Pacific in spring and winter has a positive correlation with enhanced sensible heat flux (SHF) and tropospheric low-level cold advection, which can be partly explained by the subpolar frontal zone (SPFZ) intensity.

TI  - Reconstructing Taiwan's land cover changes between 1904 and 2015 from historical maps and satellite images
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new reconstruction of changes in Taiwan's land cover and estimated uncertainty between 1904 and 2015 is presented. The reconstruction is made by integrating geographical information from historical maps and SPOT satellite images, to obtain spatially explicit land cover maps with a resolution of 500 x 500 m and distinguishes six land cover classes: forests, grasslands, agricultural land, inland water, built-up land, and bare soil. The temporal resolution is unbalanced being derived from four historical maps describing the land cover between 1904 and 1994 and five mosaic satellite images describing the land cover between 1995 and 2015. The uncertainty of the historical maps is quantified to show the aggregation error whereas the uncertainty of the satellite images is quantified as classification error. Since 1904, Taiwan, as a developing country, has gone through a not unusual sequence of population growth and subsequent urbanization, a decoupling of the demand for agricultural land from population growth, and a transition from shrinking in forest area to forest expansion. This new land cover reconstruction is expected to contribute to future revisions of global land cover reconstructions as well as to studies of (gross) land cover changes, the carbon budget, regional climate, urban heat islands, and air and water pollution at the national and sub-national level.

TI  - Bergson contra Bergson: Race and morality in <i>The Two Sources</i>
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest in the work of Bergson has seen a revival in political theory over the past two decades. Initially, this interest focused primarily on Bergson's earlier writings. However, recently there has been increased attention to Bergson's controversial last book - The Two Sources of Morality and Religion. This has had the benefit of bringing attention to a book frequently maligned as uneven and disappointing. At the same time, mostly absent from this renewed interest has been the subject of race. One of the great ironies of The Two Sources is that, even as it calls for an open morality, it relies on a series of regressive, racist and Eurocentric assumptions. It is this article's contention that, if we are going to see a renewed turn to The Two Sources, we must grapple with these assumptions, both to investigate how they limit the effectiveness of Bergson's argument, and to ensure that they are not smuggled into our own work. The article goes on to argue that Bergson's philosophy ultimately gives us the tools to challenge these reactionary elements; that his focus on morality as a dynamic and open-ended process provides us with the opportunity for recognizing the contingent limitations of Bergson's worldview.

TI  - Creating Landscape-Scale Site Index Maps for the Southeastern US Is Possible with Airborne LiDAR and Landsat Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable forest management is hugely dependent on high-quality estimates of forest site productivity, but it is challenging to generate productivity maps over large areas. We present a method for generating site index (a measure of such forest productivity) maps for plantation loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forests over large areas in the southeastern United States by combining airborne laser scanning (ALS) data from disparate acquisitions and Landsat-based estimates of forest age. For predicting canopy heights, a linear regression model was developed using ALS data and field measurements from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the US Forest Service (n = 211 plots). The model was strong (R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 1.85 m), and applicable over a large area (similar to 208,000 sq. km). To estimate the site index, we combined the ALS estimated heights with Landsat-derived maps of stand age and planted pine area. The estimated bias was low (-0.28 m) and the RMSE (3.8 m, relative RMSE: 19.7%, base age 25 years) was consistent with other similar approaches. Due to Landsat-related constraints, our methodology is valid only for relatively young pine plantations established after 1984. We generated 30 m resolution site index maps over a large area (similar to 832 sq. km). The site index distribution had a median value of 19.4 m, the 5th percentile value of 13.0 m and the 95th percentile value of 23.3 m. Further, using a watershed level analysis, we ranked these regions by their estimated productivity. These results demonstrate the potential and value of remote sensing based large-area site index maps.

TI  - The effect of spatial structure of forests on the precision and costs of plot-level forest resource estimation
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWe investigated how the precision and costs of forest resource estimates for sample plots of different type and size depend on the spatial structure of forests and jointly studied the effects of tree density and size distribution. Statistically thinking, the trees in a forest can be regarded as a point pattern. Based on the spatial properties of the point pattern, we classified the forests into clustered, random, and regular. We used empirical data from 396 mapped forest plots from Finland. The variance of the unbiased Horvitz-Thompson estimator and expected costs of the basal area and tree density estimation were calculated for 99 different sample plots of different type and size in each of the 396 forest plots. Further, we considered the estimation of the change between two time points for a subset of the data.ResultsThe precision and expected cost depended on the tree size distribution and spatial pattern of trees. While large sample plots are advisable for clustered forests or the monitoring of young forests with small trees, we see potential for measuring smaller sample plots in regular forests. The choice of sample plot was more important in clustered forests, where also the variability of the expected costs was higher.ConclusionsIf the spatial structure of forests could be predicted accurately and precisely prior to field measurements, for instance from remote sensing data, the precision of forest inventories could potentially be improved or costs decreased by allowing the sample plot size and type to vary from one forest stand to another. When using a compromise sample plot over a large region and a long inventory rotation, optimizing the sample plot for one time point ignores possible changes in forest structures caused by changes in forest management practices.

TI  - Correlation Analysis Between Groundwater Decline Trend and Human-Induced Factors in Bashang Region
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In Northern China, many regions and cities are located in semi-arid regions, and groundwater is even the only source of water to support human survival and social development. Affected by human activities, the Bashang (BS) region (including Zhangjiakou City and part of Xilin Gol League) have showed a significant decline in groundwater levels in recent years. However, in the BS region, the causes for the decline in groundwater level were not clear. In this study, we used time series of multi-source data Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) to analyze vegetation and groundwater changes based on linear regression models. The variation trends of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, derived from MODIS) and GWSA (groundwater storage anomaly, derived from GRACE and GLDAS) indicated the increasingly better vegetation in the agriculture planting areas, partially degraded vegetation in the grassland, and the declining groundwater level in the whole study region. In order to assess the impact of human-induced factors on vegetation and groundwater, the RUEseasonal calculation model was proposed based on RUE (rain use efficiency) in this study. The RUEseasonal calculation results showed that human-induced factors promoted the growth of vegetation in agricultural areas and accelerated the consumption of groundwater. In addition, we also obtained temporal and spatial distributions of human activities-affected regions. The area affected by human-induced factors in the south-central study area increased, which accelerated the decline in groundwater levels. From bulletin data, we found that the increasing tourists and vegetable production are respectively the most important factors for the increased consumption of urban water and agricultural water. Based on multi-source data, the influences of various human-induced factors on the ecological environment were explored and the area affected by human-induced factors was estimated. The results provide the valuable guidance for water resource management departments. In the BS region, it is necessary to regulate agricultural water use and strengthen residential water management.

TI  - Amide Bond Formation Catalyzed by Recyclable Copper Nanoparticles Supported on Zeolite Y under Mild Conditions
T2  - CHEMCATCHEM
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of catalysts based on supported copper nanoparticles have been prepared and tested in the amide bond formation from tertiary amines and acid anhydrides, in the presence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide as an oxidant. Copper nanoparticles on zeolite Y (CuNPs/ZY) was found to be the most efficient catalyst for the synthesis of amides, working in acetonitrile as solvent, under ligand- and base-free conditions in air. The products were obtained in good to excellent yields and in short reaction times. The CuNPs/ZY system also exhibited higher catalytic activity than some commercially available copper and iron sources and it was reused in ten reaction cycles without any further pre-treatment. This methodology has been successfully scaled-up to a gram scale with no detriment to the yield.

TI  - Local Extinction of Bull Kelp (<i>Durvillaea</i> spp.) Due to a Marine Heatwave
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed research has documented gradual changes to biological communities attributed to increases in global average temperatures. However, localized and abrupt temperature anomalies associated with heatwaves may cause more rapid biological changes. We analyzed temperature data from the South Island of New Zealand and investigated whether the hot summer of 2017/18 affected species of bull kelp, Durvillaea antarctica, D. poha, and D. willana. Durvillaea spp. are large iconic seaweeds that inhabit the low intertidal zone of exposed coastlines, where they underpin biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Sea surface temperatures (SST) during the summer of 2017/18 included the strongest marine heatwaves recorded in 38 years of existing oceanic satellite data for this region. Air temperatures were also high, and, coupled with small wave heights, resulted in strong desiccation stress during daytime low tides. BeforeAfter analysis of drone images of four reef platforms (42, 42, 44, and 45 degrees S) was used to evaluate changes to bull kelp over the hot summer. Bull kelp loss varied among species and reefs, with the greatest (100%) loss of D. poha at Pile Bay in Lyttelton Harbor (44 degrees S). In Pile Bay, SST exceeded 23 degrees C and air temperatures exceeded 30 degrees C, while Durvillaea was exposed for up to 3 h per day during low tide. Follow-up surveys showed that all bull kelps were eliminated from Pile Bay, and from all reefs within and immediately outside of Lyttelton Harbor. Following the localized extinction of bull kelp in Pile Bay, the invasive kelp Undaria pinnatifida recruited in high densities (average of 120 m(-2)). We conclude that bull kelps are likely to experience additional mortalities in the future because heatwaves are predicted to increase in magnitude and durations. Losses of the endemic D. poha are particularly concerning due to its narrow distributional range.

TI  - A QGIS Tool for Automatically Identifying Asbestos Roofing
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to asbestos fibers implies a long-term risk for human health; therefore, the development of information systems that are able to detect the extent and status of asbestos over a certain territory has become a priority. This work presents a tool (based on the geographic information system open source software, QGIS) that is conceived for automatically identifying buildings with asbestos roofing. The area under investigation is the metropolitan area around Prato (Italy). The performance analysis of this system was carried out by classifying images that were acquired by the WorldView-3 sensor. These images are available at a low cost when compared with those obtained by means of aerial surveys, and they provide adequate resolution levels for roofing classification. The tool, a QGIS plugin, has shown fairly good performance in identifying asbestos roofing, with some false negatives and some false positives when applying a per-pixel classification. A performance improvement is obtainable when considering the percentage of asbestos pixels that are contained in each roof of the analyzed image. This value is also available with the plugin. In the future, this tool should make it possible to monitor the asbestos roof removal process over time in the area of interest, in accordance with other image data that give evidence of such removals.

TI  - Assessing the cost of providing a prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS service in Ethiopia: urban-rural health facilities setting
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWhile local context costing evidence is relevant for healthcare planning, budgeting and cost-effectiveness analysis, it continues to be scarce in Ethiopia. This study assesses the cost of providing a prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS (PMTCT) service across heterogeneous prevalence (high, low) and socio-economic (urban, rural) contexts.MethodsA total of 12 health facilities from six regions in Ethiopia were purposively selected from the latest 2012 antenatal sentinel HIV prevalence report. Six health facilities with the highest HIV prevalence (8.1 to 17.3%) in urban settings and six health facilities with the lowest prevalence (0.0 to 0.1%) in rural settings were selected. A micro-costing approach was applied to identify, measure and value resources used for the provision of a comprehensive PMTCT service. The analysis was conducted across different PMTCT service packages. We also estimated national costs in urban and rural contexts.ResultsThe average cost per pregnant woman-infant pair per year (PPY) ranged from ETB 6280 (USD 319) to ETB 21,620 (USD 1099) in the urban high HIV prevalence health facilities setting. In rural low HIV prevalence health facilities, the cost ranged from ETB 4323 (USD 220) to ETB 7539 (USD 383).PMTCT service provision in urban health facilities costs more than twice the cost in rural health facilities. The average cost per PPY in an urban setting was more than double the cost in a rural setting due to the higher cost of inputs and possible inefficiencies (although there were a higher number of visits). Consumables (including antiretroviral drugs) and infrastructure were the major cost drivers in both the urban and rural health facilities. Among PMTCT service components, anti-retroviral treatment Option B+ follow-up and counselling accounted for the highest proportion of costs, which ranged from 58 to 72%. Nationally, at the current coverage, the cost of PMTCT service was USD 6 million and USD 3 million in urban and rural settings, respectively.ConclusionsThe analysis suggests that resources used for PMTCT service packages varied across health facilities and HIV prevalence contexts. Providing PMTCT service in the high HIV prevalence urban health facilities costs more than in the rural facilities. Context-specific costing was vital to provide locally sensitive evidence for health service management and priority setting.

TI  - Extracting recent short-term glacier velocity evolution over southern Alaska and the Yukon from a large collection of Landsat data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The measurement of glacier velocity fields using repeat satellite imagery has become a standard method of cryospheric research. However, the reliable discovery of important glacier velocity variations on a large scale is still problematic because time series span different time intervals and are partly populated with erroneous velocity estimates. In this study we build upon existing glacier velocity products from the GoLIVE dataset (https://nsidc.org/data/golive, last access: 26 February 2019) and compile a multi-temporal stack of velocity data over the Saint Elias Mountains and vicinity. Each layer has a time separation of 32 days, making it possible to observe details such as within-season velocity change over an area of roughly 150 000 km(2). Our methodology is robust as it is based upon a fuzzy voting scheme applied in a discrete parameter space and thus is able to filter multiple outliers. The multi-temporal data stack is then smoothed to facilitate interpretation. This results in a spatiotemporal dataset in which one can identify short-term glacier dynamics on a regional scale. The goal is not to improve accuracy or precision but to enhance extraction of the timing and location of ice flow events such as glacier surges. Our implementation is fully automatic and the approach is independent of geographical area or satellite system used. We demonstrate this automatic method on a large glacier area in Alaska and Canada. Within the Saint Elias and Kluane mountain ranges, several surges and their propagation characteristics are identified and tracked through time, as well as more complicated dynamics in the Wrangell Mountains.

This inter-comparison is undertaken by checking the altimeter data against the wind and wave model results of a given area, the Mediterranean Sea, for a 1-year period. The four data sets are consistent for wind speed, but they show substantial differences with respect to wave heights. The verification of a Sentinel-3 pass close to the coast in the northern Adriatic Sea shows irregular, spiky, large, wave height values close to the coast. This problem worsens when using high-frequency altimeter data.

TI  - Modeling and analyzing of time-resolved satellite infrared spectrum based on ground-based detector
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite infrared spectra based on ground-based detector are affected by complex factors such as satellite surface temperature, solar radiation, observation angle, etc, whose change cannot be detected in external field experiment. Therefore, it is impossible to analyze what are the main factors that affect the satellite infrared spectra. At the same time, due to the lack of physical information about the satellites through the external field experiment, the validity and physical significance of retrieving features from satellite infrared spectrum cannot be explained. In view of the above problem, a method to model and analyze satellite thermal infrared spectra based on ground-based detector is proposed. It is a feasible research method to accurately establish satellite thermal infrared spectrum model based on the ground detection, then to analyze the simulated infrared spectrum data. Firstly, considering the solar radiation, earth radiation, detectable range of the satellite on the detector, observation angle, atmospheric attenuation, etc., the satellite thermal infrared spectrum model can be established more accurately. Then, taking FY-3 satellite for example, the physical and orbital parameters of the satellite are set up, and the 3-14 mu m infrared irradiance of the satellite on the pupil of the detector is calculated by using the model. Meanwhile, the main factors affecting the infrared spectrum of the satellite are analyzed. Finally, the equivalent temperature and equivalent area are extracted by fitting the satellite infrared spectrum with the Planck formula. And they are compared with the physical properties of the satellite. The results show that among the various factors, with the satellite' movement, the change of the visible state of the satellite induced by the satellite's movement is the main factor that affects the satellite infrared spectrum. The physical meanings of the equivalent temperature and equivalent area can also be explained effectively. The equivalent temperature is close to the temperatures of the solar panels, and their temperature difference is only about 15 K. The change of equivalent area is consistent with that of the satellite projected area. Moreover, it is also found that there is a large temperature difference between the solar panels and the body, which makes their infrared spectra obviously different. Therefore, it is hopeful to obtain the areas and temperatures of the solar panels and the body respectively. This research can make up for the shortcomings of the external field experiments and promote the monitoring and recognizing of satellites by ground-based infrared detectors.

We compare LCA performed on two online samples of HIV negative Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) to detect more generalizable latent class structures and to assess the extent to which sampling considerations impact the validity of LCA results.MethodsLCAs were performed on an 1) nationwide onlinesurvey which involved no in-person contact with study staff and a 2) sentinel surveillance survey in which participants underwent HIV and syphilis testing in the city of Guangzhou, both conducted in 2014. Models for each sample were informed by risk factors for HIV acquisition in MSMthat were common to both datasets.ResultsAn LCA of the Guangzhou sentinel surveillance data indicated thepresence of two relatively similar classes, differing only by the greater tendency of one to report group sex. In contrast anLCA of the nationwide survey identified three classes, two of which shared many of the same features as those identified in the Guangzhou survey, includingthe fact that they were mainly distinguished by group sex behaviors. The final latent class in the nationwide survey was composed of members with notably few risk behaviors.ConclusionsComparisons of the latent class structures of each sample lead us to conclude that the nationwide online sample captured a larger, possiblymore representative group of Chinese MSM comprised of a larger, higher risk group and a small yet distinct lower group with few reported behaviors. The absence of a lower riskgroupinthe Guangzhou sentinel surveillance dataset suggests that MSM recruited into studies involving free HIV/STI testing may oversample MSMwith higher risk behaviors and therefore greater risk perception. Lastly, two types of higher risk MSM were emergent across both samples distinguished largely by their recent group sex behaviors. Higher odds not only of self-reportedHIV infection but also of closeted tendencies and gender fluid identities in this highest risk group suggest thatinteracting factors drive individual and structural facets of HIV risk.

TI  - Multi-decadal variability in sandy beach area and the role of climate forcing
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sandy beaches comprise 31% of the ice free coasts of the world, providing a variety of ecosystem services essential to support human well-being, particularly protection against erosion and extreme climatic events. These highly dynamic environments are controlled principally by wave energy, tides and grain size, generating complex morphodynamic patterns that translate into strong area variation. Estimates of beach area and its variability are prime inputs for coastal management, a challenge that requires data representing a wide spatiotemporal scale. In this paper, a Landsat-based semi-automated methodology was developed to reconstruct the area of 21 sandy beaches of the Montevideo (Uruguay) coast from 1984 to 2016. This long-term information was also used to discern erosion-accretion cycles by means of wavelet analysis, and to explore the role of climatic forcing on these cycles through linear mixed models. A random forest classification algorithm was applied to Landsat images in order to estimate beach area. Long-term trends described a 27-year cycle with well-delimited quasi-decadal erosion and accretion phases related to climatic configurations. The beach area was negatively affected by an increase in sea level and climatic conditions of the previous year, being positively correlated with sea surface temperature anomalies and offshore winds (which favored accretion) and negatively correlated with onshore winds and intense El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events (favoring erosion). Our findings, together with the predicted increase in the occurrence and intensity of storms and extreme ENSO events, constitute a worrying scenario, as erosion in this populated coastal zone could have negative social, economic and ecological repercussions. The methodology developed here was useful to detect long-term changes in beach area and is entirely based on open-access information. Therefore, it is potentially applicable at any location on the planet. This approach is also useful to counteract the scarcity of long-term information that has precluded robust assessments of climate change effects on coastal zones.

TI  - Phenology of Phytoplankton Blooms in a Trophic Lake Observed from Long-Term MODIS Data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton phenology critically affects elements biogeochemical cycles, ecosystem structure, and productivity. However, our understanding about the phenological process and driving mechanism is still very limited due to the shortage of long-term observation data. We used all available daily MODIS-Aqua data from 2003 to 2017 to determine bloom start dates (BSDs) in a typical trophic lake (Lake Taihu) and investigate how phytoplankton BSDs respond to climate change and environmental factors. The results indicate that BSDs have advanced 29.9 days for the entire Lake Taihu from 2003 to 2017. Spatially, an earlier phytoplankton bloom was recorded in the northern bays and the littoral regions than in the center of open water. Air temperature, wind speed, and N/P ratio (N, total nitrogen; P, total phosphorus) were three important factors affecting phytoplankton phenology. Multiple linear correlation showed that air temperature, wind speed, and N/P ratio in Spring could explain 59.9% variability of BSDs for Lake Taihu. This study provides a quantitative assessment of phytoplankton phenological shifts and elucidates the inter-relationship between phenology parameters and environmental factors, thus improving our understanding on the potential impact of climate change and eutrophication on lake ecosystems. The starting earlier and lasting longer of phytoplankton are consistent with the expected effects of climate warming on aquatic ecosystem in recent decades, which will bring new challenges for algal bloom management in eutrophic Lake Taihu.

TI  - Mangroves of Vietnam: Historical development, current state of research and future threats
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Vietnamese mangroves are among the most productive and biologically important ecosystems of the world; providing habitat/nursing grounds for commercial and non-commercial fish species, food, medicine, building materials/fuel for local communities, as well as carbon storage (blue carbon) and coastal protection from storm events. However, Vietnam's mangroves have been lost in recent decades (similar to 38%) or degraded, predominantly driven by herbicides during the Vietnam War and later by conversion to aquaculture and coastal development, although there has been a recent slowing of this degradation as a result of restoration and protection schemes. This review article discusses the principal factors which influence mangroves in Vietnam including climate and climate change, hydrology, soil and topography, and anthropogenic factors such as aquaculture expansion, illegal logging, damming, pollution), which requires special attention. We further discuss the important role that Vietnamese mangrove forests play an in the socio-economic development of the country, even though the exploitation and protection of mangrove forests in many provinces are often uncontrolled. We discuss successful management practices including co-management models for mangrove restoration, which have been a success in Vietnam. Conservation and rehabilitation process of mangrove forests by various national and international agencies are still on-going and the success of such activities is influenced by various socio-economic, political as well as environmental factors. Further challenges in effective mangrove management arise due to climate change, which accelerates high atmospheric CO2, increased air temperature, sea level rise, storminess, ocean currents and alterations in precipitation regime. Recent developments in remote sensing applications can be utilized to improve the mapping and monitoring the changes in mangrove ecosystems in Vietnam thereby improving the effective management of mangrove forests.

TI  - The afterlife of Enlightened Absolutism: commemoration of Maria Theresa and Joseph II and the politics of liberal reform in nineteenth-century imperial Austria
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW OF HISTORY-REVUE EUROPEENNE D HISTOIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article sheds new light on the ways that the enlightened Habsburg rulers Maria Theresa and Joseph II were perceived in the Austrian political landscape of the 1860s, focusing on the liberal school reform bills of 1868 and 1869. In this period when State-Church relations emerged as a crucial political topic in Austria, the memory of Joseph II and his mother, who had first enforced state control over the Church as well as education, became a useful rhetorical instrument over policy legitimization. In the 1860s, the Austrian liberals claimed ideological continuity with Maria Theresa and Joseph II and used his name to attract historical depth in their aim of abolishing the Concordat of 1855, which had granted excessive legal and educational privileges to the Catholic Church. The advocates of the Concordat argued on the other hand that through this pact with the Vatican, the historic rights of the Church against state oppression -crystallized in the figure of Joseph II- were defended. Thorough analysis of how nineteenth-century Austrians perceived their past can be valuable both as a study on the aftermath of Enlightened Absolutism and, more importantly, in assisting to comprehend the worldview and motivation of the mid-century liberal politics in imperial Austria.

TI  - High-Resolution Simulations of the Urban Thermal Climate in Suzhou City, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - City thermal discomfort conditions have been exacerbated by the rapid urbanization processes in China. High-resolution urban thermal climate simulations can help us to understand urban climate features and produce better urban designs. In this paper, a single-layer urban canopy model (UCM) combined with Landsat satellite data and high-resolution meteorological forcing data was used to simulate very-high-resolution characteristics of temperature and humidity at the urban canopy level, and the heat index at the pedestrian level was also estimated. The research shows that the National center of environmental forecasting, Oregon state university, Air force and Hydrological research lab (NOAH)-UCM model can simulate the distribution of meteorological elements for different land uses in a fine and effective manner, making it an effective approach to obtaining the fundamental data for urban climate analysis. The spatial distribution pattern of urban heat islands in Suzhou is highly consistent with urban land cover fraction. High-density and medium-density urban areas are centers of urban heat islands, and the annual number of high-temperature days and heat indices over the high-density and medium-density urban areas are markedly higher than those in low-density cities and suburbs, indicating that urban development has a significant impact on the urban thermal environment.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As freely available remotely sensed data sources proliferate, the ability to combine imagery with high spatial and temporal resolutions enables applications aimed at near-term disturbance detection. In this case study, we present methods for synthesizing burned-area information from multiple sources to map the active phase of the Elephant Hill fire from the 2017 fire season in British Columbia. We used the Bayesian Updating of Land Cover (BULC) algorithm to merge burned-area classifications from a range of remote-sensing sources such as Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and MODIS. We created provisional classifications by comparing the post-fire Normalized Burn Ratio against pre-fire image composite within the fire boundary provided by the Province of British Columbia. BULC fused the classifications in Google Earth Engine, producing a cohesive time-series stack with updated burned areas for 19 distinct days. The fire burned unevenly throughout its lifespan: a rapid burn phase of 53,097 ha in two weeks by late July, a steady burn phase to 60,000 ha until late August, an accelerated burn phase of 95,766 ha until mid-September, and containment at 203,560 ha in October. The highly automated methods presented herein can synthesize multi-source fire classifications for active phase monitoring both retrospectively and in near-real-time.

TI  - Object-based image analysis supported by data mining to discriminate large areas of soybean
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aimed to analyze the possibility to estimate and automatically map large areas of soybean cultivation through the use of MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images. Two major techniques were used: GEOgraphic-Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) and Data Mining (DM). In order to obtain the images, the segmentation algorithm implemented by Definiens Developer was used. A decision tree (DT) was created from a training set previously prepared. Time-series of images from the MODIS sensor aboard the Terra satellite were acquired in order to represent the wide variation of the vegetation pattern along the soybean crop cycle. The time-series data were used only for the CEI index. Furthermore, to compare the results obtained from GEOBIA, the slicing technique was used at the CEI level. After the training, the DT was applied to the vegetation indices generating the thematic map of the spatial distribution of soybean. In accordance with the error matrix and kappa parameter analysis, tests for statistical significance were created. Results indicate that the classification achieved by Kappa coefficients is 0.76. In short, the obtained results proved that combining vegetation indices and time-series data using GEOBIA return promising results for mapping soybean plantation on a regional scale.

T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recognition and characterization of built-up areas in the Siberian sub-Arctic urban territories of Yakutsk are dependent on two main factors: (1) the season (snow and ice from October to the end of April, the flooding period in May, and the summertime), which influences the accuracy of urban object detection, and (2) the urban structure, which influences the morphological recognition and characterization of built-up areas. In this study, high repetitiveness remote sensing Sentinel-2A and SPOT 6 high-resolution satellite images were combined to characterize and detect urban built-up areas over the city of Yakutsk. High temporal resolution of Sentinel-2A allows land use change detection and metric spatial resolution of SPOT 6 allows the characterization of built-up areas' socioeconomic functions and uses.

TI  - A novel iterative PCA-based pansharpening method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Image pansharpening methods are usually grouped into two main classes: the spectral methods and the spatial methods. For the first class, the multispectral image undergoes a spectral transformation and then one of the resultant components is totally substituted with the panchromatic image, hence leading to a considerable color distortion compared with the second class. In the literature, this issue is addressed by integrating the wavelet transform to the spectral methods in order to transfer only the spatial details of the panchromatic image. Furthermore, the spatial information quantity transferred during the fusion is usually defined by the resolution ratio between the multispectral and panchromatic images, and this is, however, not necessarily the optimal quantity providing the best images. Therefore, a simple iterative Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based method is proposed in this letter, to continuously transfer the spatial information from the panchromatic to the multispectral image until the best fused image is obtained. The spatial distortion D-s of the Quality with No Reference (QNR) index is used as a stopping criterion. The experiments applied on the Worldview-3 images show that the suggested method presents the best visual and numerical results comparatively to the PCA and the Additive Wavelet Principal Component (AWPC) methods.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 39th Canadian Symposium on Remote Sensing
CL  - Saskatoon, CANADA
AB  - Shelterbelt agroforestry systems inventory is challenging given their narrow linear feature and extensive distribution. The objective of this study was to evaluate the capability of Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and Sentinel-1B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery in (i) delineating shelterbelt tree rows on managed agricultural land in Saskatchewan, Canada, and (ii) detecting shelterbelt removal during the period 2008-2016. Contrast split segmentation for the normalized difference vegetation index and Gaussian filter (line filter) data sets from SAR were used to delineate feature borders. Several feature variables from the spectral bands of MSI were used as inputs for an object-based classification using the random forest classifier. A resulting land cover map, including the linear features of existing shelterbelts, was created with an overall accuracy of 80% and kappa value of 0.69. Shelterbelt change detection analysis using the land cover map (2016) and a legacy shelterbelt inventory map (2008) showed that 354 km of shelterbelts were removed within the study area (1,400 km(2)), accounting for 29.8% of the total shelterbelt length present in 2008. Our results demonstrated that the combination of Sentinel SAR and MSI imagery can provide sufficient information for mapping future shelterbelt planting, as well as allow the detection of shelterbelt removal.

TI  - Estimating wheat biomass from GF-3 data and a polarized water cloud model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat is one of the staple crops of the world. With the wide application of remote-sensing methods in agriculture, the use of data from synthetic aperture radar has attracted increasing attention for monitoring wheat growth. Most of previous studies estimated wheat biomass based on a water cloud model (WCM). However, when no data are available on soil moisture content, the applicability of such models is greatly reduced because of insufficient parameters. Thus, this study proposed a new polarized water cloud model (PWCM) called APWCM, which is a physical model and no auxiliary ground data was needed including soil moisture data. APWCM and WCM model was compared to estimate the above ground biomass of wheat in two different study areas. The results revealed that the WCM has a slightly lower root mean squared error (RMSE = 131.63 g m(-2), and 645.17 g m(-2)) in two different study areas. However, the APWCM has lower relative error (RE = 17.91%, and 13.53%) for wheat biomass estimation in areas with higher biomsass. The final result indicates that the APWCM can replace the WCM for estimating wheat biomass based on Gaofen-3 (GF-3) data when soil-moisture data are not available.

Modern agriculture, as other spheres of activity, needs actual information supporting end users (farmers and agricultural advisors) in their decisions and activities. Agrometeorological services facilitates better use of meteorological conditions in planning individual works and more efficient plant protection. Furthermore this data can lead also to yield increase. In Poland, the agrometeorological service is provided by the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management - National Research Institute (IMGW-PIB). In the article, the Polish Agrometeo service and its planned development is described in details. Also some problems and recommendations concerning the service development are listed.

AB  - Understanding the factors that shape individuals' beliefs about climate change is key to the development of effective climate change communication and education strategies. In this study, we test a path model of the social psychological antecedents of beliefs about climate change and evaluate the effectiveness of an educational travel program in changing them. Results show that environmental worldview and affective association with nature are two significant predictors of students' belief in the occurrence of climate change. Gender was found to influence belief in an anthropogenic causation, while political orientation was a significant predictor of conviction that climate change is occurring. Regression analysis was used to test for changes in climate beliefs before and after participation in an educational travel experience, compared to a control group, using a quasi-experimental design. Results indicate participation strengthened climate change beliefs.

TI  - Land surface reflectance retrieval from optical hyperspectral data collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle platform
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a physical-based atmospheric correction algorithm for land surface reflectance retrieval based on radiative transfer model MODTRAN 5, with which the aerosol optical thickness @550 nm (AOT@550nm), columnar water vapor (CWV) could also be estimated from the hyperspectral data collected over UAV platform. Then, the method was tested on both the synthetic and field campaign-collected hyperspectral data by an UAV-VNIRIS (UAV visible/near-infrared imaging hyperspectrometer) with the spectral range covering from 400 to 1000 nm. The retrieval results were validated with theoretical values from synthetic data and truth values from field campaign measurements. The results show that the averaged MAE (mean absolute error) and RMSE (root mean squared error) of measured and retrieved surface reflectance based on estimated AOT@550nm and CWV is 0.0134 and 0.0130. Meanwhile, the averaged MAE and RMSE of measured and retrieved surface reflectance based on ground measured AOT@550nm and CWV is 0.0101 and 0.0112. The results show that our introduced method has good agreement with the method based on ground-measured AOT@550nm and CWV. These encouraging results also indicate that the introduced physical-based atmospheric approach provides a quick and reliable way to acquire the land surface reflectance from UAV platform-observed hyperspectral data for further quantitative remote sensing applications.

TI  - Evaluating the Effects of Urbanization Evolution on Air Temperature Trends Using Nightlight Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Confounding factors like urbanization and land-use change could introduce uncertainty to the estimation of global temperature trends related to climate change. In this work, we introduce a new way to investigate the nexus between temporal trends of temperature and urbanization data at the global scale in the period from 1992 to 2013. We analyze air temperature data recorded from more than 5000 weather stations worldwide and nightlight satellite measurements as a proxy for urbanization. By means of a range of statistical methods, our results quantify and outline that the temporal evolution of urbanization affects temperature trends at multiple spatial scales with significant differences at regional and continental scales. A statistically significant agreement in temperature and nightlight trends is detected, especially in low and middle-income regions, where urbanization is rapidly growing. Conversely, in continents such as Europe and North America, increases in temperature trends are typically detected along with non-significant nightlight trends.

TI  - Does Truth Matter? Introduction to Papers by Jody Davies, Shlomit Gadot, and Donnel Stern
T2  - PSYCHOANALYTIC DIALOGUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Each of these three essays touches on the universal meaning and relevance of truth. Yet all are dealing with the relational truths that survive and hold us after the 2016 election amounted to a loss of certain assumed truths of everyday life. Donnel Stern asks, If relational truth is constructed, dialogical, multiple, how does this belief survive when we find ourselves outraged, by what seem like cavalier untruths-lies, some kind of runaway, twittered, subjective truth? He argues that a credible, measurable, objectivity about certain truths indeed survives perfectly well within our overall relational worldview. Shlomit Gadot adds that truth, relational truth, does and can exist most stably in our essential recognition of the multiplicity of (often relationally shaped) premises, frameworks, perspectives on truth. What "matters" when truth becomes threatened with serious shattering (here in a clash with love) is that she begins with an effort at genuine openness to the truth of the other. Jody Davies implies that relational truth at virtually in all levels is embedded with the trauma narrative of truth, its meanings, and motivated hiding as we know it clinically. Truth survives its subjective shattering by recognizing that within the sociopolitical realm, we are being abused and traumatized by political authority and an abusive father. The complexity of relational truth may involve creatively grieving certain certainties about truth that we may have experienced as lost. Truth in these three essays may lie in our overall effort to be equal to the full complexity of that loss and, paradoxically, to become expanded and more deeply connected through that experience.

TI  - Independent and combined effects of diethylhexyl phthalate and polychlorinated biphenyl 153 on sperm quality in the human and dog
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A temporal decline in human and dog sperm quality is thought to reflect a common environmental aetiology. This may reflect direct effects of seminal chemicals on sperm function and quality. Here we report the effects of diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB153) on DNA fragmentation and motility in human and dog sperm. Human and dog semen was collected from registered donors (n = 9) and from stud dogs (n = 11) and incubated with PCB153 and DEHP, independently and combined, at 0x, 2x, 10x and 100x dog testis concentrations. A total of 16 treatments reflected a 4 x 4 factorial experimental design. Although exposure to DEHP and/or PCB153 alone increased DNA fragmentation and decreased motility, the scale of dose-related effects varied with the presence and relative concentrations of each chemical (DEHP. PCB interaction for: DNA fragmentation; human p < 0.001, dog p < 0.001; Motility; human p < 0.001, dog p < 0.05). In both human and dog sperm, progressive motility negatively correlated with DNA fragmentation regardless of chemical presence (Human: P < 0.0001, r = -0.36; dog P < 0.0001, r = -0.29). We conclude that DEHP and PCB153, at known tissue concentrations, induce similar effects on human and dog sperm supporting the contention of the dog as a sentinel species for human exposure.

TI  - Multi-source high-resolution satellite products in Yangtze Estuary: cross-comparisons and impacts of signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, cross-comparisons of the reflectance at the top of atmosphere (rho(TOA)), atmospherically corrected water-leaving reflectance (R-rs), and suspended sediment matter (SPM) concentration derived from three high spatial resolution sensors (Landsat-8/OLI, Sentinel-2A/MSI and GF-1/WFV) were conducted. The purpose was to examine the consistency among multi-source satellite products and their potential to fill the temporal gap of high-resolution satellites time series. Geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) data and in situ data were used to verify the accuracy and reliability of the high-resolution satellite derived products. The results showed that the rho(TOA) and R-rs data of high-resolution sensors were consistent with GOCI data, especially at the red spectral ranges. The satellite-derived SPM concentrations exhibited good agreement and acceptable errors when compared with both GOCI-derived and in situ SPM data. With regard to the influence of the signal-to-noise ratios, the results showed that the radiometric sensitivities of GF-1/WFV and Landsat-8/OLI were relatively high and presented minimally detectable variations greater than 0.06% in the rho(TOA) and 0.5 mg/L in the SPM concentration for solar zenith angles < 30 degrees. However, the spatial resolution's impact on the SPM data can be greater than that of the signal-to-noise ratio for turbid waters.

TI  - SAR image despeckling with a multilayer perceptron neural network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Speckle noise in synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images severely hinders remote sensing applications; therefore, the appropriate removal of speckle noise is crucial. This paper elaborates on the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural-network model for SAR image despeckling by using a time series of SAR images. Unlike other filtering methods that use only a single radar intensity image to derive their parameters and filter that single image, this method can be trained using archived images over an area of interest to self-learn the intensity characteristics of image patches and then adaptively determine the weights and thresholds by using a neural network for image despeckling. Several hidden layers are designed for feedforward network training, and back-propagation stochastic gradient descent is adopted to reduce the error between the target output and neural-network output. The parameters in the network are automatically updated in the training process. The greatest advantage of MLP is that once the despeckling parameters are determined, they can be used to process not only new images in the same area but also images in completely different locations. Tests with images from TerraSAR-X in selected areas indicated that MLP shows satisfactory performance with respect to noise reduction and edge preservation. The overall image quality obtained using MLP was markedly higher than that obtained using numerous other filters. In comparison with other recently developed filters, this method yields a slightly higher image quality, and it demonstrates the powerful capabilities of computer learning using SAR images, which indicate the promising prospect of applying MLP to SAR image despeckling.

T2  - BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological and Hydrological Service was established 70 years ago and agrometeorological activities (soil temperature measurements and phenological observations) started in 1951. Scientific research is divided into an agricultural meteorology, forest meteorology and plant phenology. The basic purpose of research is the impact of regional climate change on the crop production, on the phenological stages of different plants as forest trees and shrubs, fruit-trees, olive-trees, grapevine and maize, and on the potential wildfire risk. In the operational tasks short-range and medium-range forecasts have been produced for TV and internet since 2004, radio since 1990 and specialized journals since 1988. For further development of Croatian agrometeorology, future plans are using monthly and seasonal forecasts for prediction of the development of yield of major agricultural crops, for irrigation purposes, as well as for potential risk of wildfires and applying satellite data and nowcasting for warning purposes in agriculture and in forest protection against fire.

TI  - A renormalized modified normalized burn ratio (RMNBR) index for detecting mature rubber plantations with Landsat-8 OLI in Xishuangbanna, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel phenology-based algorithm, namely the Landsat-derived renormalized modified normalized burn ratio (RMNBR) index, was developed with Xishuangbanna in southern China, also the second-largest national base of natural rubber production. The RMNBR algorithm included two key steps, namely the modification of NBR (or MNBR) by normalizing near infrared (NIR) and two short-wave infrared (SWIR 1/2) bands of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and, the re-normalization of MNBR between two critical phenological stages of rubber plantations, i.e. defoliation and foliation. It highlighted the temporal differences of surface reflectance of three non-visible bands (i.e. NIR, SWIR 1 and SWIR 2) in canopy density and moisture content of rubber plantations from defoliation to formation during the dry season. Then, the RMNBR was used to identify mature rubber plantations (pixels) in 2018, by combining two auxiliary masks of Landsat-based forest of the same year and topographically-suitable area of rubber trees cultivation. This makes the discrimination of mature rubber plantation straightforward as it only needs to distinguish mature rubber plantations (RMNBR < 0) from other land cover types (RMNBR > 0) within the two critical periods. The phenology-based RMNBR algorithm greatly enriches the remotely-sensed approaches for rubber plantations mapping at the regional scale.

TI  - Variations in ecosystem services in response to paddy expansion in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecosystem of the Sanjiang Plain in China has dramatically changed in the past four decades. This study investigated the history of paddy field expansion in the Sanjiang Plain and discovered the ecosystem service variations in response to paddy expansion. Integrating a series of Landsat images, we obtained the paddy expansion history from 1976 to 2015. Then, we calculated ecosystem service values (ESVs) to estimate the ecosystem service variations caused by paddy expansion in the Sanjiang Plain. The results indicate that the paddy area increased from 404,789-2,598,449 ha during 1976-2015, leading to a decline in the total ecosystem service values by 11288.04 million dollars. The largest decline in ESVs in response to paddy expansion was caused by wetland reclamation (9998.54 million dollars). Apart from agricultural products and gas regulation functions, the ESVs provided by other functions all showed a declining trend. Paddy expansion in the Sanjiang Plain increased agricultural product function at the expense of the decline of other functions. In future management practices, the rational allocation of water resources and paddy distribution are necessary in order to achieve sustainable development of both water resources and agricultural production. Some suggestions including coculture systems, restoring habitats for aquatic species, farm management that fosters biodiversity in paddy fields are provided for future sustainability.

TI  - Using Phase Unwrapping Methods to Apply D-InSAR in Mining Areas
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 39th Canadian Symposium on Remote Sensing
CL  - Saskatoon, CANADA
AB  - Phase unwrapping is one of the key processing steps of D-InSAR (Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar), and its accuracy has a great impact on the accuracy of interferometric deformation results. Therefore, it is necessary to choose the proper phase unwrapping method for mining deformation monitoring with different coherence by the comparative study of different phase unwrapping methods, because the coherence is different for different mining areas. In this paper, 2 data sets of different coherence Sentinel-1A data in Xuangang mining areas were processed using 3 different D-InSAR unwrapping methods: Region Growing, Minimum Cost Flow, and Delaunay MCF by SARscape software. Through statistical analysis of phase unwrapping results and comparative analysis of the difference between the theoretical deformation value and the deformation value calculated by SARscape, the Delaunay MCF unwrapping method is found to be the best to monitor low-coherence mining areas under most conditions. However, the Minimum Cost Flow method is a better choice when the coherence of mining areas is high, and smoother and more continuous phase unwrapping results can be obtained by selecting a mining area with better coherence.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 39th Canadian Symposium on Remote Sensing
CL  - Saskatoon, CANADA
AB  - River ice plays an important role in high latitude regions, and ice thickness is an important consideration to local residents as well as hydrologists. Two approaches, measurement (both remotely sensed and direct) and numerical calculations, are common methods used for ice thickness quantification. Measurement of ice thickness using SAR remote sensing approaches is still very challenging due to the low signals in thermal ice and limited penetration capability of C-band on consolidated ice covers. The numerical calculation can provide reasonable ice thickness estimation at a specific location but not the spatial variation. To carry out ice thickness estimations, numerous equations were proposed for numerical calculation. The Ashton equation, incorporating properties of ice and snow cover, was selected to determine the ice thicknesses along the Slave River in Canada. A framework (IceThick-RS) is proposed in this study, which incorporates polarimetric parameters of RADARSAT-2 images (quad-pol mode and C-band) into the ice thickness model. This framework was applied to estimate ice thicknesses along the Slave River. Direct measurements, gathered during the winter of 2014-2015, were used to calibrate the model. The results show that the IceThick-RS framework can be used to carry out river ice thickness estimation, especially in poorly accessible regions.

TI  - The desaturation method of DMSP/OLS nighttime light data based on vector data: taking the rapidly urbanized China as an example
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The saturation of night light data caused by sensor defects conceals the differences and details of light luminance in the urban area, which greatly limits the application of Nighttime Light (NTL) in the study of urbanization. Although some methods have been proposed to mitigate the saturation of NTL data, the research of desaturation is worth further advancing due to its shortcomings in highlighting light differences and spatial resolution. Therefore, we propose a new spectral index, the Vector Data Adjusted NTL Index (VDANTLI) after analyzing the influence of different auxiliary parameters on saturation elimination. Then, we select the three most developed urban agglomerations in China and make a series of qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results of various assessments confirm that VDANTLI can effectively alleviate NTL saturation and enhance urban lighting differences. Moreover, by dynamically adjusting the length of the grid and single-phase vector data modified time-series NTL data, we further achieve the resolution-series and time-series VDANTLI. Therefore, compared with previous desaturation models, the VDANTLI can be used as an effective indicator and even an indispensable basic data for urbanization research and socio-economic spatial analysis because of its unique advantages in spatial resolution and the capability in time-series native NTL desaturation.

T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the synergetic use of earth observation satellites optical and radar data with a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) to detect flooded areas and explore the impacts of a flood event. A flash flood episode took place in May 2016, in the central-eastern part of West Thessaly (Central Greece). Landsat-7 ETM+ and a Sentinel-1 SAR images were acquired. For Landsat-7, several water indices were applied and for the Sentinel-1 a threshold method was implemented. Elevation data were also used to improve the delineation of the inundated areas, and to estimate flood water depth. Furthermore, Sentinel-2 images were utilized so as to record the land use/cover of the flooded area. The inundated areas and the affected cultivations were delineated with high precision, and the financial effects were evaluated.

T2  - GEOSCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency recently launched the Sentinel mission to perform terrestrial observations in support of tasks such as monitoring forests, detecting land-cover changes, and managing natural disasters. The resolution of these satellite images can be as high as 10 m depending on the bands. In this study, we used the red and near-infrared bands in 10-m resolution from Sentinel-2 images to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and estimate of the green vegetation fraction in urban areas within the Pearl River Delta region (PRD). We used vegetation coverage obtained from high-resolution Google satellite images as a reference to validate the vegetation estimates derived from the Sentinel-2 images, and found the correlation between the two to be as high as 0.97. As such, information from the Sentinel-2 imagery can supplement the urban canopy parameters (UCPs) derived from the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) level-0 dataset, which is used in urban meteorological models. The rapid retrieval and open-source nature of the methodology supports high-resolution urban climate modeling studies.

TI  - Enhancement of Component Images of Multispectral Data by Denoising with Reference
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral remote sensing data may contain component images that are heavily corrupted by noise and the pre-filtering (denoising) procedure is often applied to enhance these component images. To do this, one can use reference imagescomponent images having relatively high quality and that are similar to the image subject to pre-filtering. Here, we study the following problems: how to select component images that can be used as references (e.g., for the Sentinel multispectral remote sensing data) and how to perform the actual denoising. We demonstrate that component images of the same resolution as well as component images of a better resolution can be used as references. To provide high efficiency of denoising, reference images have to be transformed using linear or nonlinear transformations. This paper proposes a practical approach to doing this. Examples of denoising tests and real-life images demonstrate high efficiency of the proposed approach.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Water Use Efficiency and Terrestrial Drought Recovery across the Contiguous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE) is defined as the ratio of carbon gain (i.e., gross primary productivity; GPP) to water consumption (i.e., evapotranspiration; ET). WUE is markedly influential on carbon and water cycles, both of which are fundamental for ecosystem state, climate and the environment. Drought can affect WUE, subsequently disturbing the composition and functionality of terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, the impacts of drought on WUE and its components (i.e., GPP and ET) are assessed across the Contiguous US (CONUS) at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Soil moisture simulations from land surface modeling are utilized to detect and characterize agricultural drought episodes and remotely sensed GPP and ET are retrieved from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). GPP, as the biome vitality indicator against drought stress, is employed to investigate drought recovery and the ecosystems' required time to revert to pre-drought condition. Results show that drought recovery duration indicates a positive correlation with drought severity and duration, meaning that a protracted drought recovery is more likely to happen following severe droughts with prolonged duration. WUE is found to almost always increase in response to severe (or worse) drought episodes. Additionally, ET anomalies are negatively correlated with drought severity and ET is expected to decrease during severe (or worse) drought episodes. Lastly, the changes of WUE are decomposed in relation to its components and the cross-relation among the variables is revealed and a consistent changing pattern is detected.

TI  - Wetland Classification with Multi-Angle/Temporal SAR Using Random Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand and mitigate threats to the long-term health and functioning of wetlands, there is need to establish comprehensive inventorying and monitoring programs. Here, remote sensing data and machine learning techniques that could support or substitute traditional field-based data collection are evaluated. For the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario, Canada, different combinations of multi-angle/temporal quad pol RADARSAT-2, simulated compact pol RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and high and low spatial resolution Digital Elevation and Surface Models (DEM and DSM, respectively) were used to classify six land cover classes with Random Forests: shallow water, marsh, swamp, water, forest, and agriculture/non-forested. Results demonstrate that high accuracies can be achieved with multi-temporal SAR data alone (e.g., user's and producer's accuracies 90% for a model based on a spring image and a summer image), or via fusion of SAR and DEM and DSM data for single dates/incidence angles (e.g., user's and producer's accuracies 90% for a model based on a spring image, DEM, and DSM data). For all models based on single SAR images, simulated compact pol data generally achieved lower accuracies than quad pol RADARSAT-2 data. However, it was possible to compensate for observed differences through either multi-temporal/angle data fusion or the inclusion of DEM and DSM data (i.e., as a result, there was not a statistically significant difference between multiple models). With a higher repeat-pass cycle than RADARSAT-2, RCM is expected to be a reliable source of C-band SAR data that will contribute positively to ongoing efforts to inventory wetlands and monitor change in areas containing the same land cover classes evaluated here.

TI  - Landsat 8 Based Leaf Area Index Estimation in Loblolly Pine Plantations
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important biophysical parameter used to monitor, model, and manage loblolly pine plantations across the southeastern United States. Landsat provides forest scientists and managers the ability to obtain accurate and timely LAI estimates. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between loblolly pine LAI measured in situ (at both leaf area minimum and maximum through two growing seasons at two geographically disparate study areas) and vegetation indices calculated using data from Landsat 7 (ETM+) and Landsat 8 (OLI). Sub-objectives included examination of the impact of georegistration accuracy, comparison of top-of-atmosphere and surface reflectance, development of a new empirical model for the species and region, and comparison of the new empirical model with the current operational standard. Permanent plots for the collection of ground LAI measurements were established at two locations near Appomattox, Virginia and Tuscaloosa, Alabama in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Each plot is thirty by thirty meters in size and is located at least thirty meters from a stand boundary. Plot LAI measurements were collected twice a year using the LI-COR LAI-2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer. Ground measurements were used as dependent variables in ordinary least squares regressions with ETM+ and OLI-derived vegetation indices. We conclude that accurately-located ground LAI estimates at minimum and maximum LAI in loblolly pine stands can be combined and modeled with Landsat-derived vegetation indices using surface reflectance, particularly simple ratio (SR) and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), across sites and sensors. The best resulting model (LAI = -0.00212 + 0.3329SR) appears not to saturate through an LAI of 5 and is an improvement over the current operational standard for loblolly pine monitoring, modeling, and management in this ecologically and economically important region.

TI  - A Combined Approach of Field Data and Earth Observation for Coastal Risk Assessment
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional approach for coastal monitoring consists in ground investigations that are burdensome both in terms of logistics and costs, on a national or even regional scale. Earth Observation (EO) techniques can represent a cost-effective alternative for a wide scale coastal monitoring. Thanks to the all-weather day/night radar imaging capability and to the nationwide acquisition plan named MapItaly, devised by the Italian Space Agency and active since 2010, COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) constellation is able to provide X-band images covering the Italian territory. However, any remote sensing approach must be accurately calibrated and corrected taking into account the marine conditions. Therefore, in situ data are essential for proper EO data selection, geocoding, tidal corrections and validation of EO products. A combined semi-automatic technique for coastal risk assessment and monitoring, named COSMO-Beach, is presented here, integrating ground truths with EO data, as well as its application on two different test sites in Apulia Region (South Italy). The research has shown that CSK data for coastal monitoring ensure a shoreline detection accuracy lower than image pixel resolution, and also providing several advantages: low-cost data, a short revisit period, operational continuity and a low computational time.

TI  - The Mangrove Forests Change and Impacts from Tropical Cyclones in the Philippines Using Time Series Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Philippines is rich in mangrove forests, containing 50% of the total mangrove species of the world. However, the vast mangrove areas of the country have declined to about half of its cover in the past century. In the 1970s, action was taken to protect the remaining mangrove forests under a government initiative, recognizing the ecological benefits mangrove forests can bring. Here, we examine two mangrove areas in the PhilippinesCoron in Palawan and Balangiga-Lawaan in Eastern Samar over a 30-year period. Sets of Landsat images from 1987 to 2016 were classified and spatially analyzed using four landscape metrics. Additional analyses of the mangrove areas' spatiotemporal dynamics were conducted. The impact of typhoon landfall on the mangrove areas was also analyzed in a qualitative manner. Spatiotemporal changes indicate that both the Coron and Balangiga-Lawaan mangrove forests, though declared as protected areas, are still suffering from mangrove area loss. Mangrove areal shrinkage and expansion can be attributed to both typhoon occurrence and management practices. Overall, our study reveals which mangrove forests need more responsive action, and provides a different perspective in understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of these mangrove areas.

TI  - Determination of Primary and Secondary Lahar Flow Paths of the Fuego Volcano (Guatemala) Using Morphometric Parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 3 June 2018, a strong eruption of the Fuego volcano in Guatemala produced a dense cloud of 10-km-high volcanic ash and destructive pyroclastic flows that caused nearly 200 deaths and huge economic losses in the region. Subsequently, due to heavy rains, destructive secondary lahars were produced, which were not plotted on the hazard maps using the LAHAR Z software. In this work we propose to complement the mapping of this type of lahars using remote-sensing (Differential Interferometry, DINSAR) in Sentinel images 1A and 2A, to locate areas of deformation of the relief on the flanks of the volcano, areas that are possibly origin of these lahars. To determine the trajectory of the lahars, parameters and morphological indices were analyzed with the software System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis (SAGA). The parameters and morphological indices used were the accumulation of flow (FCC), the topographic wetness index (TWI), the length-magnitude factor of the slope (LS). Finally, a slope stability analysis was performed using the Shallow Landslide Susceptibility software (SHALSTAB) based on the Mohr-Coulomb theory and its parameters: internal soil saturation degree and effective precipitation, parameters required to destabilize a hillside. In this case, the application of this complementary methodology provided a more accurate response of the areas destroyed by primary and secondary lahars in the vicinity of the volcano.

TI  - SAR Backscatter and InSAR Coherence for Monitoring Wetland Extent, Flood Pulse and Vegetation: A Study of the Amazon Lowland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been identified as a potential source of information for monitoring surface water, including open water and flooded vegetation, in frequent time intervals, which is very significant for flood mapping applications. The SAR specular reflectance separates open water and land surface, and its canopy penetration capability allows enhanced backscatter from flooded vegetation. Further, under certain conditions, the SAR signal from flooded vegetation may remain coherent between two acquisitions, which can be exploited using the InSAR technique. With these SAR capabilities in mind, this study examines the use of multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 C band SAR intensity and coherence components to monitor wetland extent, inundation and vegetation of a tropical wetland, such as Amazon lowland. For this study, 22 multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 images (21 pairs) were used for InSAR processing and the pairs in the low water stage (November, December) showed high coherence over the wetland areas. The three-year intensity stack was used for assessing wetland boundary, inundation extent, flood pulse, hydroperiod, and wetland vegetation. In addition to the intensity, derived coherence was used for classifying wetland vegetation. Wetland vegetation types were successfully classified with 86% accuracy using the statistical parameters derived from the multi-temporal intensity and coherence data stacks. We have found that in addition to SAR intensity, coherence provided information about wetland vegetation. In the next year, the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), will provide more data with frequent revisits, enhancing the application of SAR intensity and coherence for monitoring these types of wetlands at large scales.

TI  - Effect of Land Cover Fractions on Changes in Surface Urban Heat Islands Using Landsat Time-Series Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Man-made materials now cover a dominant proportion of urban areas, and such conditions not only change the absorption of solar radiation, but also the allocation of the solar radiation and cause the surface urban heat island effect, which is considered a serious problem associated with the deterioration of urban environments. Although numerous studies have been performed on surface urban heat islands, only a few have focused on the effect of land cover changes on surface urban heat islands over a long time period. Using six Landsat image scenes of the Metropolitan Development Area of Wuhan, our experiment (1) applied a mapping method for normalized land surface temperatures with three land cover fractions, which were impervious surfaces, non-chlorophyllous vegetation and soil and vegetation fractions, and (2) performed a fitting analysis of fierce change areas in the surface urban heat island intensity based on a time trajectory. Thematic thermal maps were drawn to analyze the distribution of and variations in the surface urban heat island in the study area. A Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis was used to extract the land cover fraction information. Then, six ternary triangle contour graphics were drawn based on the land surface temperature and land cover fraction information. A time trajectory was created to summarize the changing characteristics of the surface urban heat island intensity. A fitting analysis was conducted for areas showing fierce changes in the urban heat intensity. Our results revealed that impervious surfaces had the largest impacts on surface urban heat island intensity, followed by the non-chlorophyllous vegetation and soil fraction. Moreover, the results indicated that the vegetation fraction can alleviate the occurrence of surface urban heat islands. These results reveal the impact of the land cover fractions on surface urban heat islands. Urban expansion generates impervious artificial objects that replace pervious natural objects, which causes an increase in land surface temperature and results in a surface urban heat island.

TI  - Study of the Relationship between Urban Expansion and PM<sub>10</sub> Concentration Using Multi-Temporal Spatial Datasets and the Machine Learning Technique: Case Study for Daegu, South Korea
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - To protect the population from respiratory diseases and to prevent the damages due to air pollution, the main cause of air pollution should be identified. This research assessed the relationship between the airborne particulate concentrations (PM10) and the urban expansion in Daegu City in South Korea from 2007 to 2017 using multi-temporal spatial datasets (Landsat images, measured PM10 data) and the machine learning technique in the following steps. First, the expanded urban areas were detected from the multiple Landsat images using support vector machine (SVM), a widely used machine learning technique. Next, the annual PM10 concentrations were calculated using the long-term measured PM10 data. Finally, the degrees of increase of the expanded urban areas and of the PM10 concentrations in Daegu from 2007 to 2017 were calculated by counting the pixels representing the expanded urban areas and computing variation of the annual PM10 concentrations, respectively. The experiment results showed that there is a minimal or even no relationship at all between the urban expansion and the PM10 concentrations because the urban areas expanded by 55.27 km(2) but the annual PM10 concentrations decreased by 17.37 g/m(3) in Daegu from 2007 to 2017.

TI  - Monitoring and Analyzing Mountain Glacier Surface Movement Using SAR Data and a Terrestrial Laser Scanner: A Case Study of the Himalayas North Slope Glacier Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The offset tracking technique based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image intensity information can estimate glacier displacement even when glacier velocities are high and the time interval between images is long, allowing for the broad use of this technique in glacier velocity monitoring. Terrestrial laser scanners, a non-contact measuring system, can measure the velocity of a glacier even if there are no control points arranged on a glacier. In this study, six COSMO-SkyMed images acquired between 31 July and 22 December 2016 were used to obtain the glacial movements of five glaciers on the northern slope of the central Himalayas using the offset tracking approach. During the period of image acquirement, a terrestrial laser scanner was used, and point clouds of two periods in a small area at the terminus of the Pingcuoliesa Glacier were obtained. By selecting three fixed areas of the point clouds that have similar shapes across two periods, the displacements of the centers of gravity of the selected areas were calculated by using contrast analyses of feature points. Although the overall low-density point clouds data indicate that the glacial surfaces have low albedos relative to the wavelength of the terrestrial laser scanner and the effect of its application is therefore influenced in this research, the registration accuracy of 0.0023 m/d in the non-glacial areas of the scanner's measurements is acceptable, considering the magnitude of 0.072 m/d of the minimum glacial velocity measured by the scanner. The displacements from the point clouds broadly agree with the results of the offset tracking technique in the same area, which provides further evidence of the reliability of the measurements of the SAR data in addition to the analyses of the root mean squared error of the velocity residuals in non-glacial areas. The analysis of the movement of five glaciers in the study area revealed the dynamic behavior of these glacial surfaces across five periods. G089972E28213N Glacier, Pingcuoliesa Glacier and Shimo Glacier show increasing surface movement velocities from the terminus end to the upper part with elevations of 1500 m, 4500 m, and 6400 m, respectively. The maximum velocities on the glacial surface profiles were 31.69 cm/d, 62.40 cm/d, and 42.00 cm/d, respectively. In contrast, the maximum velocity of Shie Glacier, 50.60 cm/d, was observed at the glacier's terminus. For each period, G090138E28210N Glacier exhibited similar velocity values across the surface profile, with a maximum velocity of 39.70 cm/d. The maximum velocities of G089972E28213N Glacier, Pingcuoliesa Glacier, and Shie Glacier occur in the areas where the topography is steepest. In general, glacial surface velocities are higher in the summer than in the winter in this region. With the assistance of a terrestrial laser scanner with optimized wavelengths or other proper ground-based remote sensing instruments, the offset tracking technique based on high-resolution satellite SAR data should provide more reliable and detailed information for local and even single glacial surface displacement monitoring.

TI  - Competition and Burn Severity Determine Post-Fire Sapling Recovery in a Nationally Protected Boreal Forest of China: An Analysis from Very High-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Anticipating how boreal forest landscapes will change in response to changing fire regime requires disentangling the effects of various spatial controls on the recovery process of tree saplings. Spatially explicit monitoring of post-fire vegetation recovery through moderate resolution Landsat imagery is a popular technique but is filled with ambiguous information due to mixed pixel effects. On the other hand, very-high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery accurately measures crown size of tree saplings but has gained little attention and its utility for estimating leaf area index (LAI, m(2)/m(2)) and tree sapling abundance (TSA, seedlings/ha) in post-fire landscape remains untested. We compared the explanatory power of 30 m Landsat satellite imagery with 0.5-m WorldView-2 VHR imagery for LAI and TSA based on field sampling data, and subsequently mapped the distribution of LAI and TSA based on the most predictive relationships. A random forest (RF) model was applied to assess the relative importance and causal mechanisms of spatial controls on tree sapling recovery. The results showed that pixel percentage of canopy trees (PPCT) derived from VHR imagery outperform all Landsat-derived spectral indices for explaining variance of LAI (R-VHR(2) = 0.676 vs. R-Landsat(2) = 0.427) and TSA (R-VHR(2) = 0.508 vs. R-Landsat(2) = 0.499). The RF model explained an average of 55.5% (SD = 3.0%, MSE = 0.382, N = 50) of the variation of estimated LAI. Understory vegetation coverage (competition) and post-fire surviving mature trees (seed sources) were the most important spatial controls for LAI recovery, followed by burn severity (legacy effect), topographic factors (environmental filter) and nearest distance to unburned area (edge effect). These analyses allow us to conclude that in our study area, mitigating wildfire severity and size may increase forest resilience to wildfire damage. Given the easily-damaged seed banks and relatively short seed dispersal distance of coniferous trees, reasonable human help to natural recovery of coniferous forests is necessary for severe burns with a large patch size, particularly in certain areas. Our research shows the VHR WorldView-2 imagery better resolves key characteristics of forest landscapes like LAI and TSA than Landsat imagery, providing a valuable tool for land managers and researchers alike.

TI  - Exploitation of Sentinel-2 Time Series to Map Burned Areas at the National Level: A Case Study on the 2017 Italy Wildfires
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data play a major role in supporting knowledge about fire severity by delivering rapid information to map fire-damaged areas in a precise and prompt way. The high availability of free medium-high spatial resolution optical satellite data, offered by the Copernicus Programme, has enabled the development of more detailed post-fire mapping. This research study deals with the exploitation of Sentinel-2 time series to map burned areas, taking advantages from the high revisit frequency and improved spatial and spectral resolution of the MSI optical sensor. A novel procedure is here presented to produce medium-high spatial resolution burned area mapping using dense Sentinel-2 time series with no a priori knowledge about wildfire occurrence or burned areas spatial distribution. The proposed methodology is founded on a threshold-based classification based on empirical observations that discovers wildfire fingerprints on vegetation cover by means of an abrupt change detection procedure. Effectiveness of the procedure in mapping medium-high spatial resolution burned areas at the national level was demonstrated for a case study on the 2017 Italy wildfires. Thematic maps generated under the Copernicus Emergency Management Service were used as reference products to assess the accuracy of the results. Multitemporal series of three different spectral indices, describing wildfire disturbance, were used to identify burned areas and compared to identify their performances in terms of spectral separability. Result showed a total burned area for the Italian country in the year 2017 of around 1400 km(2), with the proposed methodology generating a commission error of around 25% and an omission error of around 40%. Results demonstrate how the proposed procedure allows for the medium-high resolution mapping of burned areas, offering a benchmark for the development of new operational downstreaming services at the national level based on Copernicus data for the systematic monitoring of wildfires.

TI  - A Method for Landsat and Sentinel 2 (HLS) BRDF Normalization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2 (HLS) project aims to generate a seamless surface reflectance product by combining observations from USGS/NASA Landsat-8 and ESA Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellites. These satellites' sampling characteristics provide nearly constant observation geometry and low illumination variation through the scene. However, the illumination variation throughout the year impacts the surface reflectance by producing higher values for low solar zenith angles and lower reflectance for large zenith angles. In this work, we present a model to derive the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) normalization and apply it to the HLS product at 30 m spatial resolution. It is based on the BRDF parameters estimated from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance product (M{O,Y}D09) at 1 km spatial resolution using the VJB method (Vermote et al., 2009). Unsupervised classification (segmentation) of HLS images is used to disaggregate the BRDF parameters to the HLS spatial resolution and to build a BRDF parameters database at HLS scale. We first test the proposed BRDF normalization for different solar zenith angles over two homogeneous sites, in particular one desert and one Peruvian Amazon forest. The proposed method reduces both the correlation with the solar zenith angle and the coefficient of variation (CV) of the reflectance time series in the red and near infrared bands to 4% in forest and keeps a low CV of 3% to 4% for the deserts. Additionally, we assess the impact of the view zenith angle (VZA) in an area of the Brazilian Amazon forest close to the equator, where impact of the angular variation is stronger because it occurs in the principal plane. The directional reflectance shows a strong dependency with the VZA. The current HLS BRDF correction reduces this dependency but still shows an under-correction, especially in the near infrared, while the proposed method shows no dependency with the view angles. We also evaluate the BRDF parameters using field surface albedo measurements as a reference over seven different sites of the US surface radiation budget observing network (SURFRAD) and five sites of the Australian OzFlux network.

TI  - Identifying Mangrove Deforestation Hotspots in South Asia, Southeast Asia and Asia-Pacific
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves inhabit highly productive inter-tidal ecosystems in >120 countries in the tropics and subtropics providing critical goods and services to coastal communities and contributing to global climate change mitigation owing to substantial carbon stocks. Despite their importance, global mangrove distribution continues to decline primarily due to anthropogenic drivers which vary by region/country. South Asia, Southeast Asia and Asia-Pacific contain approximately 46% of the world's mangrove ecosystems, including the most biodiverse mangrove forests. This region also exhibits the highest global rates of mangrove loss. Remotely sensed data provides timely and accurate information on mangrove distribution and dynamics critical for targeting loss hotspots and guiding intervention. This report inventories, describes and compares all known single- and multi-date remotely sensed datasets with regional coverage and provides areal mangrove extents by country. Multi-date datasets were used to estimate dynamics and identify loss hotspots (i.e., countries that exhibit greatest proportional loss). Results indicate Myanmar is the primary mangrove loss hotspot, exhibiting 35% loss from 1975-2005 and 28% between 2000-2014. Rates of loss in Myanmar were four times the global average from 2000-2012. The Philippines is additionally identified as a loss hotspot, with secondary hotspots including Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia. This information helps inform and guide mangrove conservation, restoration and managed-use within the region.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for Retrieval of Water Quality Indicators in Case-II Waters: A Case Study of Hong Kong
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities in coastal regions are endangering marine ecosystems. Coastal waters classified as case-II waters are especially complex due to the presence of different constituents. Recent advances in remote sensing technology have enabled to capture the spatiotemporal variability of the constituents in coastal waters. The present study evaluates the potential of remote sensing using machine learning techniques, for improving water quality estimation over the coastal waters of Hong Kong. Concentrations of suspended solids (SS), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and turbidity were estimated with several machine learning techniques including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Cubist regression (CB), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Landsat (5,7,8) reflectance data were compared with in situ reflectance data to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. The highest accuracies of the water quality indicators were achieved by ANN for both, in situ reflectance data (89%-Chl-a, 93%-SS, and 82%-turbidity) and satellite data (91%-Chl-a, 92%-SS, and 85%-turbidity. The water quality parameters retrieved by the ANN model was further compared to those retrieved by standard Case-2 Regional/Coast Colour (C2RCC) processing chain model C2RCC-Nets. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) for estimating SS and Chl-a were 3.3 mg/L and 2.7 mu g/L, respectively, using ANN, whereas RMSEs were 12.7 mg/L and 12.9 mu g/L for suspended particulate matter (SPM) and Chl-a concentrations, respectively, when C2RCC was applied on Landsat-8 data. Relative variable importance was also conducted to investigate the consistency between in situ reflectance data and satellite data, and results show that both datasets are similar. The red band (wavelength approximate to 0.665 mu m) and the product of red and green band (wavelength approximate to 0.560 mu m) were influential inputs in both reflectance data sets for estimating SS and turbidity, and the ratio between red and blue band (wavelength approximate to 0.490 mu m) as well as the ratio between infrared (wavelength approximate to 0.865 mu m) and blue band and green band proved to be more useful for the estimation of Chl-a concentration, due to their sensitivity to high turbidity in the coastal waters. The results indicate that the NN based machine learning approaches perform better and, thus, can be used for improved water quality monitoring with satellite data in optically complex coastal waters.

TI  - Urban Tree Species Classification Using a WorldView-2/3 and LiDAR Data Fusion Approach and Deep Learning
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas feature complex and heterogeneous land covers which create challenging issues for tree species classification. The increased availability of high spatial resolution multispectral satellite imagery and LiDAR datasets combined with the recent evolution of deep learning within remote sensing for object detection and scene classification, provide promising opportunities to map individual tree species with greater accuracy and resolution. However, there are knowledge gaps that are related to the contribution of Worldview-3 SWIR bands, very high resolution PAN band and LiDAR data in detailed tree species mapping. Additionally, contemporary deep learning methods are hampered by lack of training samples and difficulties of preparing training data. The objective of this study was to examine the potential of a novel deep learning method, Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), to identify dominant individual tree species in a complex urban environment within a fused image of WorldView-2 VNIR, Worldview-3 SWIR and LiDAR datasets. DenseNet results were compared against two popular machine classifiers in remote sensing image analysis, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our results demonstrated that: (1) utilizing a data fusion approach beginning with VNIR and adding SWIR, LiDAR, and panchromatic (PAN) bands increased the overall accuracy of the DenseNet classifier from 75.9% to 76.8%, 81.1% and 82.6%, respectively. (2) DenseNet significantly outperformed RF and SVM for the classification of eight dominant tree species with an overall accuracy of 82.6%, compared to 51.8% and 52% for SVM and RF classifiers, respectively. (3) DenseNet maintained superior performance over RF and SVM classifiers under restricted training sample quantities which is a major limiting factor for deep learning techniques. Overall, the study reveals that DenseNet is more effective for urban tree species classification as it outperforms the popular RF and SVM techniques when working with highly complex image scenes regardless of training sample size.

TI  - Mapping Climatological Bare Soil Albedos over the Contiguous United States Using MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface bare soil albedo is an important variable in climate modeling studies and satellite-based retrievals of land-surface properties. In this study, we used multiyear 500 m albedo products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to derive the bare soil albedo for seven spectral bands and three broadbands over the contiguous United States (CONUS). The soil line based on red and green spectral signatures derived from MODIS data was used as the basis to detect and extract bare soil albedo. A comparison against bare soil albedo derived from 30 m Landsat data has been made, showing that the MODIS bare soil albedo had a bias of 0.003 and a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.036. We found that the bare soil albedo was negatively correlated with soil moisture from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), with a relatively stable exponential relationship reflecting the darkening effect that moisture has on most soils. However, quantification of the relationship between bare soil albedo and soil moisture still needs to be improved through simultaneous and instantaneous measurements at a finer spatial resolution. Statistics of the multiyear climatological bare soil albedos calculated using soil types and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land cover types suggest that: Land cover type is a better indicator for determining the magnitude of bare soil albedos for the vegetated areas, as the vegetation density is correlated with soil moisture; and soil type is a better indicator for determining the slope of soil lines over sparsely vegetated areas, as it contains information of the soil texture, roughness, and composition. The generated bare soil albedo can be applied to improve the parameterization of surface energy budget in climate and remote sensing models as well as the retrieval accuracy of some satellite products.

TI  - A Comparative Review of Manifold Learning Techniques for Hyperspectral and Polarimetric SAR Image Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - In remote sensing, hyperspectral and polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images are the two most versatile data sources for a wide range of applications such as land use land cover classification. However, the fusion of these two data sources receive less attention than many other, because of their scarce data availability, and relatively challenging fusion task caused by their distinct imaging geometries. Among the existing fusion methods, including manifold learning-based, kernel-based, ensemble-based, and matrix factorization, manifold learning is one of most celebrated techniques for the fusion of heterogeneous data. Therefore, this paper aims to promote the research in hyperspectral and PolSAR data fusion, by providing a comprehensive comparison between existing manifold learning-based fusion algorithms. We conducted experiments on 16 state-of-the-art manifold learning algorithms that embrace two important research questions in manifold learning-based fusion of hyperspectral and PolSAR data: (1) in which domain should the data be alignedthe data domain or the manifold domain; and (2) how to make use of existing labeled data when formulating a graph to represent a manifoldsupervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised. The performance of the algorithms were evaluated via multiple accuracy metrics of land use land cover classification over two data sets. Results show that the algorithms based on manifold alignment generally outperform those based on data alignment (data concatenation). Semi-supervised manifold alignment fusion algorithms performs the best among all. Experiments using multiple classifiers show that they outperform the benchmark data alignment-based algorithms by ca. 3% in terms of the overall classification accuracy.

TI  - Spatial Distribution and Changes of the Realizable Triple Cropping System in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploiting the full potential of the realizable triple cropping system (RTCS) is one of the most effective methods for increasing land productivity, thus promoting food security. However, insufficient attention is paid to the spatial distribution of the RTCS in China. Here, a method is developed to assess the RTCS in China, considering terrain, climatic conditions, crop climatic-ecological suitability, and the spatial changes in the RTCS between 1951 and 2010. Results indicate that a decrease of 19 Mha was caused by topographic correction, while climate change increased the same area by 14 Mha. Based on crop climatic-ecological conditions, the suitability of the RTCS was indicated for 1068 counties. The boundary of the RTCS moved northward by 100-200 km in the Middle-Lower reaches of the Yangtze River, but southward by approximately 250 km in Yunnan Province. The area of the RTCS is 135 Mha distributed across 775 counties in Southern China. These findings are useful for guiding the policy of cultivated land use in Southern China. The approach can be adopted elsewhere to determine the RTCS for sustainable land use and increasing land productivity.

TI  - Integration of Convolutional Neural Networks and Object-Based Post-Classification Refinement for Land Use and Land Cover Mapping with Optical and SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Object-based image analysis (OBIA) has been widely used for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping using optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images because it can utilize spatial information, reduce the effect of salt and pepper, and delineate LULC boundaries. With recent advances in machine learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become state-of-the-art algorithms. However, CNNs cannot be easily integrated with OBIA because the processing unit of CNNs is a rectangular image, whereas that of OBIA is an irregular image object. To obtain object-based thematic maps, this study developed a new method that integrates object-based post-classification refinement (OBPR) and CNNs for LULC mapping using Sentinel optical and SAR data. After producing the classification map by CNN, each image object was labeled with the most frequent land cover category of its pixels. The proposed method was tested on the optical-SAR Sentinel Guangzhou dataset with 10 m spatial resolution, the optical-SAR Zhuhai-Macau local climate zones (LCZ) dataset with 100 m spatial resolution, and a hyperspectral benchmark the University of Pavia with 1.3 m spatial resolution. It outperformed OBIA support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). SVM and RF could benefit more from the combined use of optical and SAR data compared with CNN, whereas spatial information learned by CNN was very effective for classification. With the ability to extract spatial features and maintain object boundaries, the proposed method considerably improved the classification accuracy of urban ground targets. It achieved overall accuracy (OA) of 95.33% for the Sentinel Guangzhou dataset, OA of 77.64% for the Zhuhai-Macau LCZ dataset, and OA of 95.70% for the University of Pavia dataset with only 10 labeled samples per class.

TI  - Eruptive Styles Recognition Using High Temporal Resolution Geostationary Infrared Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high temporal resolution of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) instrument aboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) provides the opportunity to investigate eruptive processes and discriminate different styles of volcanic activity. To this goal, a new detection method based on the wavelet transform of SEVIRI infrared data is proposed. A statistical analysis is performed on wavelet smoothed data derived from SEVIRI Mid-Infrared( MIR) radiances collected from 2011 to 2017 on Mt Etna (Italy) volcano. Time-series analysis of the kurtosis of the radiance distribution allows for reliable hot-spot detection and precise timing of the start and end of eruptive events. Combined kurtosis and gradient trends allow for discrimination of the different activity styles of the volcano, from effusive lava flow, through Strombolian explosions, to paroxysmal fountaining. The same data also allow for the prediction, at the onset of an eruption, of what will be its dominant eruptive style at later stages. The results obtained have been validated against ground-based and literature data.

TI  - Modelling of Wine Production Using Land Surface Temperature and FAPARThe Case of the Douro Wine Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetative development of grapevines is orchestrated by very specific meteorological conditions. In the wine industry vineyards demand diligent monitoring, since quality and productivity are the backbone of the economic potential. Regional climate indicators and meteorological information are essential to winemakers to assure proper vineyard management. Satellite data are very useful in this process since they imply low costs and are easily accessible. This work proposes a statistical modelling approach based on parameters obtained exclusively from satellite data to simulate annual wine production. The study has been developed for the Douro Demarcated Region (DDR) due to its relevance in the winemaking industry. It is the oldest demarcated and controlled winemaking region of the world and listed as one of UNESCO's World Heritage regions. Monthly variables associated with Land Surface Temperatures (LST) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation (FAPAR), which is representative of vegetation canopy health, were analysed for a 15-year period (2004 to 2018), to assess their relation to wine production. Results showed that high wine production years are associated with higher than normal FAPAR values during approximately the entire growing season and higher than normal values of surface temperature from April to August. A robust linear model was obtained using the most significant predictors, that includes FAPAR in December and maximum and mean LST values in March and July, respectively. The model explains 90% of the total variance of wine production and presents a correlation coefficient of 0.90 (after cross validation). The retained predictors' anomalies for the investigated vegetative year (October to July) from 2017/2018 satellite data indicate that the ensuing wine production for the DDR is likely to be below normal, i.e., to be lower than what is considered a high-production year. This work highlights that is possible to estimate wine production at regional scale based solely on low-resolution remotely sensed observations that are easily accessible, free and available for numerous grapevines regions worldwide, providing a useful and easy tool to estimate wine production and agricultural monitoring.

TI  - Improving an Extreme Rainfall Detection System with GPM IMERG data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have shown a growing trend in terms of frequency and severity of extreme events. As never before, having tools capable to monitor the amount of rain that reaches the Earth's surface has become a key point for the identification of areas potentially affected by floods. In order to guarantee an almost global spatial coverage, NASA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) IMERG products proved to be the most appropriate source of information for precipitation retrievement by satellite. This study is aimed at defining the IMERG accuracy in representing extreme rainfall events for varying time aggregation intervals. This is performed by comparing the IMERG data with the rain gauge ones. The outcomes demonstrate that precipitation satellite data guarantee good results when the rainfall aggregation interval is equal to or greater than 12 h. More specifically, a 24-h aggregation interval ensures a probability of detection (defined as the number of hits divided by the total number of observed events) greater than 80%. The outcomes of this analysis supported the development of the updated version of the ITHACA Extreme Rainfall Detection System (ERDS: erds.ithacaweb.org). This system is now able to provide near real-time alerts about extreme rainfall events using a threshold methodology based on the mean annual precipitation.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Vegetation Dynamics as a Response to Climate Variability and Drought Patterns in the Semiarid Region, Eritrea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing concern over change in vegetation dynamics and drought patterns with the increasing climate variability and warming trends in Africa, particularly in the semiarid regions of East Africa. Here, several geospatial techniques and datasets were used to analyze the spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics in response to climate (precipitation and temperature) and drought in Eritrea from 2000 to 2017. A pixel-based trend analysis was performed, and a Pearson correlation coefficient was computed between vegetation indices and climate variables. In addition, vegetation condition index (VCI) and standard precipitation index (SPI) classifications were used to assess drought patterns in the country. The results demonstrated that there was a decreasing NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) slope at both annual and seasonal time scales. In the study area, 57.1% of the pixels showed a decreasing annual NDVI trend, while the significance was higher in South-Western Eritrea. In most of the agro-ecological zones, the shrublands and croplands showed decreasing NDVI trends. About 87.16% of the study area had a positive correlation between growing season NDVI and precipitation (39.34%, p < 0.05). The Gash Barka region of the country showed the strongest and most significant correlations between NDVI and precipitation values. The specific drought assessments based on VCI and SPI summarized that Eritrea had been exposed to recurrent droughts of moderate to extreme conditions during the last 18 years. Based on the correlation analysis and drought patterns, this study confirms that low precipitation was mainly attributed to the slowly declining vegetation trends and increased drought conditions in the semi-arid region. Therefore, immediate action is needed to minimize the negative impact of climate variability and increasing aridity in vegetation and ecosystem services.

TI  - Estimation of Tropospheric and Ionospheric Delay in DInSAR Calculations: Case Study of Areas Showing (Natural and Induced) Seismic Activity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a proposal to make simultaneous allowance for both ionospheric and tropospheric corrections in differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) measurements. Atmospheric delay in the interferometric phase may cause the detection of terrain-surface changes to be impossible or significantly distorted. This fact remains of special importance in the case of surface changes that show limited amplitude and spatial range. Two areas were chosen to verify the validity of the proposed solution. The first area includes terrains affected by underground copper-ore mining activity (Poland), which shows high induced seismic activity. Mining tremors recorded in this area cause the terrain surface to locally subside. The authors analyzed three tremors that were recorded in 2016, 2017, and 2019. Each of the tremors exceeded a magnitude of Mw 4.0. The second area is located in the coastal region of Chile, in the Cardenal Caro province. In this case, the authors focused on a series of three earthquakes recorded on 11 March 2010. The strongest of the earthquakes was of Mw 7.0 magnitude. In the first case, calculations were based on obtained data from the Sentinel 1 satellites, and in the second case from the ALOS-1 satellite. It is demonstrated that simultaneous allowance for both the tropospheric and ionospheric corrections significantly improves the final results. The authors were also able to use the analyzed cases to demonstrate that implementation of the corrections does not have negative influence on the range and magnitude of local ground-surface deformations. At the same time, such implementation minimizes local displacement fluctuations and reduces displacement values in areas affected by deformations. The examples used in the article served to show that tropospheric correction is mainly responsible for global corrections (i.e., within the whole analyzed spatial range), while ionospheric correction reduces local fluctuations.

TI  - Evaluation of Five Atmospheric Correction Algorithms over French Optically-Complex Waters for the Sentinel-3A OLCI Ocean Color Sensor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-3A satellite was launched on 16 February 2016 with the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI-A) on-board for the study of ocean color. The accuracy of ocean color parameters depends on the atmospheric correction algorithm (AC). This processing consists of removing the contribution of the atmosphere from the total measured signal by the remote sensor at the top of the atmosphere. Five ACs: the baseline AC, the Case 2 regional coast color neural network AC, its alternative version, the Polymer AC, and the standard NASA AC, are inter-compared over two bio-optical contrasted French coastal waters. The retrieved water-leaving reflectances are compared with in situ ocean color radiometric measurements collected using an ASD FielSpec4 spectrometer. Statistical and spectral analysis were performed to assess the best-performing AC through individual (relative error (RE) at 412 nm ranging between 23.43 and 57.31%; root mean squared error (RMSE) at 412 nm ranging between 0.0077 and 0.0188) and common (RE(412 nm) = 24.15-50.07%; RMSE(412 nm) = 0.0081-0.0132) match-ups. The results suggest that the most efficient schemes are the alternative version of the Case 2 regional coast color neural network AC with RE(412 nm) = 33.52% and RMSE(412 nm) = 0.0101 for the individual and Polymer with RE(412 nm) = 24.15% and RMSE(412 nm) = 0.0081 for the common ACs match-ups. Sensitivity studies were performed to assess the limitations of the AC, and the errors of retrievals showed no trends when compared to the turbidity and CDOM.

Twenty years of ocean color satellite imagery document such cross-shelf transport events via three export pathways in the Gulf of Mexico: from the Campeche Bank toward the central Gulf, from the Campeche Bank toward the Florida Straits, and from the Mississippi Delta to the Florida Straits. A catalog of these events was created based on the visual examination of 7280 daily satellite images. Water transport from the Campeche Bank to the central Gulf occurred frequently and with no seasonal pattern. Transport from Campeche Bank to the Florida Straits occurred episodically, when the Loop Current was retracted. Four such episodes were identified, between about December and June, in 2002, 2009, 2016, and 2017, each lasting 3 months. Movement of Mississippi River water to the Florida Straits was more frequent and showed near seasonal occurrence, when the Loop Current was extended, while the Mississippi River discharge seems to play only a secondary role. Eight such episodes were identifiedin 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2011, 2014, and 2015each lasting 3 months during summer. The 2015 episode lasted 5 months.

TI  - A Novel Object-Based Deep Learning Framework for Semantic Segmentation of Very High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data: Comparison with Convolutional and Fully Convolutional Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning architectures have received much attention in recent years demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in several segmentation, classification and other computer vision tasks. Most of these deep networks are based on either convolutional or fully convolutional architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel object-based deep-learning framework for semantic segmentation in very high-resolution satellite data. In particular, we exploit object-based priors integrated into a fully convolutional neural network by incorporating an anisotropic diffusion data preprocessing step and an additional loss term during the training process. Under this constrained framework, the goal is to enforce pixels that belong to the same object to be classified at the same semantic category. We compared thoroughly the novel object-based framework with the currently dominating convolutional and fully convolutional deep networks. In particular, numerous experiments were conducted on the publicly available ISPRS WGII/4 benchmark datasets, namely Vaihingen and Potsdam, for validation and inter-comparison based on a variety of metrics. Quantitatively, experimental results indicate that, overall, the proposed object-based framework slightly outperformed the current state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks by more than 1% in terms of overall accuracy, while intersection over union results are improved for all semantic categories. Qualitatively, man-made classes with more strict geometry such as buildings were the ones that benefit most from our method, especially along object boundaries, highlighting the great potential of the developed approach.

TI  - Research on Spatiotemporal Land Deformation (2012-2018) over Xi'an, China, with Multi-Sensor SAR Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ancient city of Xi'an, China, has been suffering severe land subsidence and ground fissure hazards since the 1960s, mainly due to the over-withdrawal of groundwater and large-scale urban construction. This has threatened and will continue to threaten the stability of urban infrastructure, such as the construction and operation of high buildings and subway lines. It is necessary to map the spatiotemporal variations of land subsidence over Xi'an, and to analyze their causes and the correlation with underground water level changes and ground fissure deformation. Time series of land subsidence were observed with the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique, using multi-sensor SAR datasets from 2012 to 2018. Four land subsidence rate maps over Xi'an city were retrieved from TerraSAR-X, ALOS/PALSAR2, and Sentinel-1 data, each with different tracks. The InSAR derived results were then cross-validated with three independent SAR data stacks, and calibrated with GPS and leveling observations. Next, the spatiotemporal evolutions of three main regional land subsidence zones were quantitatively analyzed in detail, and the surface deformation of the Xi'an subway network was spatially analyzed. Third, the correlations between land subsidence and ground water withdrawal, ground fissure deformation, landforms, and faults were intensively analyzed. Finally, a flat lying sill model with distributed contractions was implemented to model the InSAR deformation over one typical subsidence zone, which further suggested that the ground deformation was mainly caused by groundwater withdrawal. This systematic research can provide sound evidence to serve decision-making for land subsidence mitigation in Xi'an, and may also guide land subsidence research in other cities.

TI  - Mapping Wetland Types in Semiarid Floodplains: A Statistical Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed vegetation maps are needed for wetland conservation and restoration as different vegetation communities have distinct water requirements. It is a continuous challenge to map the distribution of different wetland types on a regional scale, and a trade-off between the categorical details and availability of resources to ensure broad applications is often necessary for operational mapping. Here, we evaluated the capacity and performance of statistical learning in discriminating wetland types using Landsat time series and geomorphological variables computed from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM). Our study showed that there was a discrimination limit of statistical learning in wetland mapping. The approach was clearly inadequate in distinguishing certain wetland types. In semiarid Australia, our results suggested that the appropriate level for floodplain wetland mapping included four classes: tree-dominated woodlands, shrublands, vegetated swamps, and non-flood-dependent terrestrial communities. Our results also demonstrated that the geomorphological metrics significantly improved the accuracy of wetland classification. Furthermore, geomorphological metrics derived from the freely available coarser resolution SRTM DEM were as beneficial for wetland mapping as those extracted from finer scale commercially-based LiDAR DEM. The finding enables the widespread applications of our approach, as both data sources are freely available globally.

TI  - Estimating the Seasonal Dynamics of the Leaf Area Index Using Piecewise LAI-VI Relationships Based on Phenophases
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is not only an important parameter used to describe the geometry of vegetation canopy but also a key input variable for ecological models. One of the most commonly used methods for LAI estimation is to establish an empirical relationship between the LAI and the vegetation index (VI). However, the LAI-VI relationships had high seasonal variability, and they differed among phenophases and VIs. In this study, the LAI-VI relationships in different phenophases and for different VIs (i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv)) were investigated based on 82 site-years of LAI observed data and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) VI products. Significant LAI-VI relationships were observed during the vegetation growing and declining periods. There were weak LAI-VI relationships (p > 0.05) during the flourishing period. The accuracies for the LAIs estimated with the piecewise LAI-VI relationships based on different phenophases were significantly higher than those estimated based on a single LAI-VI relationship for the entire vegetation active period. The average root mean square error (RMSE) +/- standard deviation (SD) value for the LAIs estimated with the piecewise LAI-VI relationships was 0.38 +/- 0.13 (based on the NDVI), 0.41 +/- 0.13 (based on the EVI) and 0.41 +/- 0.14 (based on the NIRv), respectively. In comparison, it was 0.46 +/- 0.13 (based on the NDVI), 0.55 +/- 0.15 (based on the EVI) and 0.55 +/- 0.15 (based on the NIRv) for those estimated with a single LAI-VI relationship. The performance of the three VIs in estimating the LAI also varied among phenophases. During the growing period, the mean RMSE +/- SD value for the estimated LAIs was 0.30 +/- 0.11 (LAI-NDVI relationships), 0.37 +/- 0.11 (LAI-EVI relationships) and 0.36 +/- 0.13 (LAI-NIRv relationships), respectively, indicating the NDVI produced significantly better LAI estimations than those from the other two VIs. In contrast, the EVI produced slightly better LAI estimations than those from the other two VIs during the declining period (p > 0.05), and the mean RMSE +/- SD value for the estimated LAIs was 0.45 +/- 0.16 (LAI-NDVI relationships), 0.43 +/- 0.23 (LAI-EVI relationships) and 0.45 +/- 0.25 (LAI-NIRv relationships), respectively. Hence, the piecewise LAI-VI relationships based on different phenophases were recommended for the estimations of the LAI instead of a single LAI-VI relationship for the entire vegetation active period. Furthermore, the optimal VI in each phenophase should be selected for the estimations of the LAI according to the characteristics of vegetation growth.

TI  - Urban Mapping Accuracy Enhancement in High-Rise Built-Up Areas Deployed by 3D-Orthorectification Correction from WorldView-3 and LiDAR Imageries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Orthorectification is an important step in generating accurate land use/land cover (LULC) from satellite imagery, particularly in urban areas with high-rise buildings. Such buildings generally appear as oblique shapes on very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite images, which reflect a bigger area of coverage than the real built-up area on LULC mapping. This drawback can cause not only uncertainties in urban mapping and LULC classification, but can also result in inaccurate urban change detection. Overestimating volume or area of high-rise buildings has a negative impact on computing the exact amount of environmental heat and emission. Hence, in this study, we propose a method of orthorectfiying VHR WorldView-3 images by integrating light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to overcome the aforementioned problems. A 3D rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) model was proposed with respect to high-accuracy ground control points collected from the LiDAR data derived from the digital surface model. Multiple probabilities for generating an orthrorectified image from WV-3 were assessed using 3D RCP model to achieve the optimal combination technique, with low vertical and horizontal errors. Ground control point (GCPs) collection is sensitive to variation in number and data collection pattern. These steps are important in orthorectification because they can cause the morbidity of a standard equation, thereby interrupting the stability of 3D RCP model by reducing the accuracy of the orthorectified image. Hence, we assessed the maximum possible scenarios of resampling and ground control point collection techniques to bridge the gap. Results show that the 3D RCP model accurately orthorectifies the VHR satellite image if 20 to 100 GCPs were collected by convenience pattern. In addition, cubic conventional resampling algorithm improved the precision and smoothness of the orthorectified image. According to the root mean square error, the proposed combination technique enhanced the vertical and horizontal accuracies of the geo-positioning process to up to 0.8 and 1.8 m, respectively. Such accuracy is considered very high in orthorectification. The proposed technique is easy to use and can be replicated for other VHR satellite and aerial photos.

TI  - Detection and Monitoring of Tunneling Induced Ground Movements Using Sentinel-1 SAR Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR interferometry is a powerful tool to obtain millimeter accuracy measurements of surface displacements. The Sentinel-1 satellite mission nowadays provides extensive spatial coverage, regular acquisitions and open availability. In this paper, we present an MT-InSAR analysis showing the spatial and temporal evolution of ground displacements arising from the construction of a 3.71 km overflow tunnel in Genoa, Italy. Underground tunneling can often modify the hydrological regime around an excavated area and might induce generalized surface subsidence phenomena due to pore pressure variations, especially under buildings. The tunnel was excavated beneath a densely urbanized area lying on upper Cretaceous marly limestone and Pliocene clays. Significant cumulative displacements up to 30 mm in the Line of Sight (LOS) direction were detected during the tunnel excavation. No displacements were recorded before until the middle of 2016. The Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) analysis reveals in high detail the areal subsidence, especially where the subsurface is characterized by clay and alluvial deposits as well as there is the presence of large building complexes. The time-series and the displacement rate cross-sections highlight a clear relation with the tunnel face advancement, responsible for the subsidence phenomena, which proceeded northward starting from the middle of 2016 to the end of 2017. The stabilization occurred in a range of five-six months from the beginning of each displacement phase. Due to the low subsidence ratio the ground settlements did not cause severe damages to the buildings.

TI  - Development and Evaluation of a Leaf Disease Damage Extension in Cropsim-CERES Wheat
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing disease models to simulate and analyse yield losses for various pathogens is a challenge for the crop modelling community. In this study, we developed and tested a simple method to simulate septoria tritici blotch (STB) in the Cropsim-CERES Wheat model studying the impacts of damage on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield. A model extension was developed by adding a pest damage module to the existing wheat model. The module simulates the impact of daily damage on photosynthesis and leaf area index. The approach was tested on a two-year dataset from Argentina with different wheat cultivars. The accuracy of the simulated yield and leaf area index (LAI) was improved to a great extent. The Root mean squared error (RMSE) values for yield (1144 kg ha(-1)) and LAI (1.19 m(2) m(-2)) were reduced by half (499 kg ha(-1)) for yield and LAI (0.69 m(2) m(-2)). In addition, a sensitivity analysis of different disease progress curves on leaf area index and yield was performed using a dataset from Germany. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated the ability of the model to reduce yield accurately in an exponential relationship with increasing infection levels (0-70%). The extended model is suitable for site specific simulations, coupled with for example, available remote sensing data on STB infection.

TI  - Role of Emissivity in Lava Flow "Distance-to-Run' Estimates from Satellite-Based Volcano Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an established technological solution for bridging critical gaps in volcanic hazard assessment and risk mitigation. The enormous amount of remote sensing data available today at a range of temporal and spatial resolutions can aid emergency management in volcanic crises by detecting and measuring high-temperature thermal anomalies and providing lava flow propagation forecasts. In such thermal estimates, an important role is played by emissivitythe efficiency with which a surface radiates its thermal energy at various wavelengths. Emissivity has a close relationship with land surface temperatures and radiant fluxes, and it impacts directly on the prediction of lava flow behavior, as mass flux estimates depend on measured radiant fluxes. Since emissivity is seldom measured and mostly assumed, we aimed to fill this gap in knowledge by carrying out a multi-stage experiment, combining laboratory-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses, remote sensing data, and numerical modeling. We tested the capacity for reproducing emissivity from spaceborne observations using ASTER Global Emissivity Database (GED) while assessing the spatial heterogeneity of emissivity. Our laboratory-satellite emissivity values were used to establish a realistic land surface temperature from a high-resolution spaceborne payload (ETM+) to obtain an instant temperature-radiant flux and eruption rate results for the 2001 Mount Etna (Italy) eruption. Forward-modeling tests conducted on the 2001 aa' lava flow by means of the MAGFLOW Cellular Automata code produced differences of up to similar to 600 m in the simulated lava flow distance-to-run' for a range of emissivity values. Given the density and proximity of urban settlements on and around Mount Etna, these results may have significant implications for civil protection and urban planning applications.

TI  - Assessing Across-Scale Optical Diversity and Productivity Relationships in Grasslands of the Italian Alps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The linearity and scale-dependency of ecosystem biodiversity and productivity relationships (BPRs) have been under intense debate. In a changing climate, monitoring BPRs within and across different ecosystem types is crucial, and novel remote sensing tools such as the Sentinel-2 (S2) may be adopted to retrieve ecosystem diversity information and to investigate optical diversity and productivity patterns. But are the S2 spectral and spatial resolutions suitable to detect relationships between optical diversity and productivity? In this study, we implemented an integrated analysis of spatial patterns of grassland productivity and optical diversity using optical remote sensing and Eddy Covariance data. Across-scale optical diversity and ecosystem productivity patterns were analyzed for different grassland associations with a wide range of productivity. Using airborne optical data to simulate S2, we provided empirical evidence that the best optical proxies of ecosystem productivity were linearly correlated with optical diversity. Correlation analysis at increasing pixel sizes proved an evident scale-dependency of the relationships between optical diversity and productivity. The results indicate the strong potential of S2 for future large-scale assessment of across-ecosystem dynamics at upper levels of observation.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Land Use and Cover Change from 1990 to 2010: A Case Study of Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and cover change (LUCC) is one of the most significant parts of global environmental changes, which reflects the interaction between human society and natural resources. In China, the urbanization process is experiencing a rapid sprawl since the reform and open program in 1978, and there has been a serious change in situation in the human-land relationship. In this paper, taking Jiangsu province located in the eastern coastal developed region as an example, the historic evolution process of the land use situation from 1990 to 2010 was explored. Landsat images from three periods were analyzed, using the land use transition matrix model, the land use dynamic degree model, and the land use degree model to evaluate the LUCC of Jiangsu during two research periods from 1990 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2010. Additionally, logistic regression models and some quantitative analysis were applied to identify the major potential driving factors behind the LUCC during the research period based on different dimensions. The results showed the following: (1) the most obvious change was the continuous increase of built-up area and the decrease of arable land, which reflected the deterioration of the ecological environment and the accelerate of the urbanization trend. (2) The land use change dynamic degree from 2000 to 2010 was much greater than that from 1990 to 2000. (3) Socio-economic elements and human activities were the major driving forces of LUCC in Jiangsu province. Amongst these forces, the driving factors of the population change, GDP, per capita household income, and per capita housing area have an obvious effect on the arable land loss and the built-up area expansion.

TI  - Analyzing the Uncertainty of Estimating Forest Aboveground Biomass Using Optical Imagery and Spaceborne LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is important for carbon accounting. Forest AGB estimation has been conducted with a variety of data sources and prediction methods, but many uncertainties still exist. In this study, six prediction methods, including Gaussian processes, stepwise linear regression, nonlinear regression using a logistic model, partial least squares regression, random forest, and support vector machines were used to estimate forest AGB in Jiangxi Province, China, by combining Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and field measurements. We compared the effect of three factors (prediction methods, sample sizes of field measurements, and cross-validation settings) on the predictive quality of the methods. The results showed that the prediction methods had the most considerable effect on the prediction quality. In most cases, random forest produced more accurate estimates than the other methods. The sample sizes had an obvious effect on accuracy, especially for the random forest model. The accuracy increased with increasing sample sizes. The random forest algorithm with a large number of field measurements, was the most precise (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.73, root mean square error (RMSE) = 23.58 Mg/ha). Increasing the number of folds within the cross-validation settings improved the R-2 values. However, no apparent change occurred in RMSE for different numbers of folds. Finally, the wall-to-wall forest AGB map over the study area was generated using the random forest model.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Stripe Detecting and Destriping Using the Joint Sparsity Constraint with Iterative Support Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images have been applied to a wide range of fields, but they are often degraded by various types of stripes, which affect the image visual quality and limit the subsequent processing tasks. Most existing destriping methods fail to exploit the stripe properties adequately, leading to suboptimal performance. Based on a full consideration of the stripe properties, we propose a new destriping model to achieve stripe detection and stripe removal simultaneously. In this model, we adopt the unidirectional total variation regularization to depict the directional property of stripes and the weighted 2,1>-norm regularization to depict the joint sparsity of stripes. Then, we combine the alternating direction method of multipliers and iterative support detection to solve the proposed model effectively. Comparison results on simulated and real data suggest that the proposed method can remove and detect stripes effectively while preserving image edges and details.

TI  - Efficient Identification of Corn Cultivation Area with Multitemporal Synthetic Aperture Radar and Optical Images in the Google Earth Engine Cloud Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of corn cultivation areas is crucial for ensuring food security, eradicating hunger, adjusting crop structures, and managing water resources. The emergence of high-resolution images, such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, enables the identification of corn at the field scale, and these images can be applied on a large scale with the support of cloud computing technology. Hebei Province is the major production area of corn in China, and faces serious groundwater overexploitation due to irrigation. Corn was mapped using multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. A total of 1712 scenes of Sentinel-2 data and 206 scenes of Sentinel-1 data acquired from June to October 2017 were processed to composite image metrics as input to a random forest (RF) classifier. To avoid speckle noise in the classification results, the pixel-based classification result was integrated with the object segmentation boundary completed in eCognition software to generate an object-based corn map according to crop intensity. The results indicated that the approach using multitemporal SAR and optical images in the GEE cloud platform is reliable for corn mapping. The corn map had a high F1-Score of 90.08% and overall accuracy of 89.89% according to the test dataset, which was not involved in model training. The corn area estimated from optical and SAR images was well correlated with the census data, with an R-2 = 0.91 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 470.90 km(2). The results of the corn map are expected to provide detailed information for optimizing crop structure and water management, which are critical issues in this region.

TI  - Remote Observation in Habitat Suitability Changes for Waterbirds in the West Songnen Plain, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Being one of the most important habitats for waterbirds, China's West Songnen Plain has experienced substantial damage to its ecosystem, especially the loss and degradation of wetlands and grasslands due to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change. These occurrences have led to an obvious decrease in waterbird species and overall population size. Periodic and timely monitoring of changes in habitat suitability and understanding the potential driving factors for waterbirds are essential for maintaining regional ecological security. In this study, land cover changes from 2000 to 2015 in this eco-sensitive plain were examined using Landsat images and an object-based classification method. Four groups of environmental factors, including human disturbance, water situation, food availability, and shelter safety, characterized by remote sensing data were selected to develop a habitat suitability index (HSI) for assessing habitat suitability for waterbirds. HSI was further classified into four grades (optimum, good, general, and poor), and their spatiotemporal patterns were documented from 2000 to 2015. Our results revealed that cropland expansion and wetland shrinkage were the dominant land cover changes. Waterbird habitat areas in the optimum grade experienced a sharp decline by 7195 km(2). The habitat area in good suitability experienced reduction at a change rate of -8.64%, from 38,672 km(2) to 35,331 km(2). In addition, waterbird habitats in the general and poor grades increased overall by 10.31%. More specifically, the total habitat areas with optimum suitable grade, in five national nature reserves over the study region, decreased by 12.21%, while habitat areas with poor suitable grade increased by 3.89%. Changes in habitat suitability could be largely attributed to the increase in human disturbance, including agricultural cultivation from wetlands and grasslands and the expansion of built-up lands. Our findings indicate that additional attention should be directed towards reducing human impact on habitat suitability for sustainable ecosystems.

TI  - Multi-Level Classification Based on Trajectory Features of Time Series for Monitoring Impervious Surface Expansions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As urbanization has profound effects on global environmental changes, quick and accurate monitoring of the dynamic changes in impervious surfaces is of great significance for environmental protection. The increased spatiotemporal resolution of imagery makes it possible to construct time series to obtain long-time-period and high-accuracy information about impervious surface expansion. In this study, a three-step monitoring method based on time series trajectory segmentation was developed to extract impervious surface expansion using Landsat time series and was applied to the Xinbei District, Changzhou, China, from 2005 to 2017. Firstly, the original time series was segmented and fitted to remove the noise caused by clouds, shadows, and interannual differences, leaving only the trend information. Secondly, the time series trajectory features of impervious surface expansion were described using three phases and four types with nine parameters by analyzing the trajectory characteristics. Thirdly, a multi-level classification method was used to determine the scope of impervious surface expansion, and the expansion time was superimposed to obtain a spatiotemporal distribution map. The proposed method yielded an overall accuracy of 90.58% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.90, demonstrating that Landsat time series remote sensing images could be used effectively in this approach to monitor the spatiotemporal expansion of impervious surfaces.

TI  - A Hierarchical Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-Based Ship Target Detection Method in Spaceborne SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ghost phenomenon in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging is primarily caused by azimuth or range ambiguities, which cause difficulties in SAR target detection application. To mitigate this influence, we propose a ship target detection method in spaceborne SAR imagery, using a hierarchical convolutional neural network (H-CNN). Based on the nature of ghost replicas and typical target classes, a two-stage CNN model is built to detect ship targets against sea clutter and the ghost. First, regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted from a large imaged scene during the coarse-detection stage. Unwanted ghost replicas represented major residual interference sources in ROIs, therefore, the other CNN process was executed during the fine-detection stage. Finally, comparative experiments and analyses, using Sentinel-1 SAR data and various assessment criteria, were conducted to validate H-CNN. Our results showed that the proposed method can outperform the conventional constant false-alarm rate technique and CNN-based models.

TI  - Object-Based Window Strategy in Thermal Sharpening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions has led to the disaggregation of remotely sensed land surface temperatures (LSTs) for better applications. The window used for regression is one of the primary factors affecting the disaggregation accuracy. Global window strategies (GWSs) and local window strategies (LWSs) have been widely used and discussed, while object-based window strategies (OWSs) have rarely been considered. Therefore, this study presents an OWS based on a segmentation algorithm and provides a basis for selecting an optimal window size balancing both accuracy and efficiency. The OWS is tested with Landsat 8 data and simulated data via the aggregation-then-disaggregation strategy, and compared with the GWS and LWS. Results tested with the Landsat 8 data indicate that the proposed OWS can accurately and efficiently generate high-resolution LSTs. In comparison to the GWS, the OWS improves the mean accuracy by 0.19 K at different downscaling ratios, in particular by 0.30 K over urban areas; compared with the LWS, the OWS performs better in most cases but performs slightly worse due to the increasing downscaling ratio in some cases. Results tested with the simulated data indicate that the OWS is always superior to both GWS and LWS regardless of the downscaling ratios, and the OWS improves the mean accuracy by 0.44 K and 0.19 K in comparison to the GWS and LWS, respectively. These findings suggest the potential ability of the OWS to generate super-high-resolution LSTs over heterogeneous regions when the pixels within the object-based windows derived via segmentation algorithms are more homogenous.

TI  - The Spatial and Heterogeneity Impacts of Population Urbanization on Fine Particulate (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the effect of population urbanization on Fine Particulate (PM2.5) in the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China from 2006 to 2016 by employing PM2.5 remote sensing data and using the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model. The study contributes to the growing empirical literature by addressing heterogeneity, spillover, and dynamic effects in the dynamic spatial panel modeling process simultaneously. The empirical results show that population urbanization has a significant impact on PM2.5 with a positive spillover effect and a dynamic effect being detected and controlled. The heterogeneity effects of population urbanization on PM2.5 due to geographical positions show evidence of an obvious inverted U-shaped curve relationship in the upstream area and an increasing function curve in the midstream and downstream areas. The heterogeneity effects due to population urbanization levels show that an inverted N-shape curve relationship exists in low and medium urbanization level areas, while a U-shape curve relationship exists in high urbanization level areas. It is hoped that this study will inform the local governments about the heterogeneity of population urbanization and spillover effects of air pollution when addressing air pollution control.

TI  - Factors Associated with Leptospirosis in Domestic Cattle in Salakphra Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Leptospirosis found in cattle (Bos taurus indicus) has potentially increased in economic impact. The objective was to investigate the factors associated with leptospirosis in cattle in the protected area. We investigated the seroprevalence of leptospirosis in cattle in Salakphra Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand. Serum was collected to investigate the seroprevalence by agglutination test and their associated factors. From a total of 513 samples, antibodies against Leptospira were detected in 92.2% of samples. Within a total of 42 herds, the serovar with the highest prevalence was L interrogans serovar Tarassovi (92.9%). Most leptospirosis was found in medium-sized herds with the highest concentrations in cattle farms close to cities (52.4%, p < 0.05). Seroprevalence was associated with herd size, raising pattern in the dry and wet seasons, grazing distance, number of years that cattle were kept in the farm, the introduction of new cattle into the farm, and keeping some pets in the farm. The results of the study suggest that keeping cattle in larger herds, raising pattern and distance, keeping period, and introducing new cattle and having pets impart potential risk of increasing leptospirosis exposure. These results indicate that cattle are important hosts of Leptospira in Thailand and may act as sentinels of Leptospira infection for wildlife and people in the protected areas.

TI  - A New CNN-Bayesian Model for Extracting Improved Winter Wheat Spatial Distribution from GF-2 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When the spatial distribution of winter wheat is extracted from high-resolution remote sensing imagery using convolutional neural networks (CNN), field edge results are usually rough, resulting in lowered overall accuracy. This study proposed a new per-pixel classification model using CNN and Bayesian models (CNN-Bayesian model) for improved extraction accuracy. In this model, a feature extractor generates a feature vector for each pixel, an encoder transforms the feature vector of each pixel into a category-code vector, and a two-level classifier uses the difference between elements of category-probability vectors as the confidence value to perform per-pixel classifications. The first level is used to determine the category of a pixel with high confidence, and the second level is an improved Bayesian model used to determine the category of low-confidence pixels. The CNN-Bayesian model was trained and tested on Gaofen 2 satellite images. Compared to existing models, our approach produced an improvement in overall accuracy, the overall accuracy of SegNet, DeepLab, VGG-Ex, and CNN-Bayesian was 0.791, 0.852, 0.892, and 0.946, respectively. Thus, this approach can produce superior results when winter wheat spatial distribution is extracted from satellite imagery.

TI  - Spatial Accessibility of Urban Forests in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pearl River Delta (PRD) is one of the most important economic zones both in China and in the world. Its rapid economic development has been associated with many environmental problems such as the loss of forests in urban areas. We estimated the accessibility of forests in the PRD by quantifying spatial proximity and travel time. We found that distances from a large proportion of the points of interest (POIs) (similar to 45%) and urban lands (similar to 38%, where similar to 49 urban residents live) to the nearest forests were greater than 1000 m; suggesting a low spatial proximity to forests. Urban parksimportant outdoor recreational areasappeared to have insufficient forest coverage within their 1000 m buffer zones. When forest accessibility was measured by travel time under optimal modes of transport; it was less than 15 min for most urban lands (similar to 95%), which accommodates 98% of the total urban population. More importantly; the travel time to the nearest forest was negatively correlated with gross domestic product density (GDP(d)), but not with population density (POPd). The GDP(d) and POPd; however; increased log-linearly with the Euclidean distance to the nearest forest. In addition to the low proximity to forests; there existed inequalities among urban residents who live in areas with different levels of GDP(d) and POPd. Future urban planning needs not only to increase the total coverage of urban forests; but also to improve their spatial evenness across the urban landscapes in the PRD.

TI  - R-CNN-Based Ship Detection from High Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Offshore and inland river ship detection has been studied on both synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing imagery. However, the classic ship detection methods based on SAR images can cause a high false alarm ratio and be influenced by the sea surface model, especially on inland rivers and in offshore areas. The classic detection methods based on optical images do not perform well on small and gathering ships. This paper adopts the idea of deep networks and presents a fast regional-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) method to detect ships from high-resolution remote sensing imagery. First, we choose GaoFen-2 optical remote sensing images with a resolution of 1 m and preprocess the images with a support vector machine (SVM) to divide the large detection area into small regions of interest (ROI) that may contain ships. Then, we apply ship detection algorithms based on a region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) on ROI images. To improve the detection result of small and gathering ships, we adopt an effective target detection framework, Faster-RCNN, and improve the structure of its original convolutional neural network (CNN), VGG16, by using multiresolution convolutional features and performing ROI pooling on a larger feature map in a region proposal network (RPN). Finally, we compare the most effective classic ship detection method, the deformable part model (DPM), another two widely used target detection frameworks, the single shot multibox detector (SSD) and YOLOv2, the original VGG16-based Faster-RCNN, and our improved Faster-RCNN. Experimental results show that our improved Faster-RCNN method achieves a higher recall and accuracy for small ships and gathering ships. Therefore, it provides a very effective method for offshore and inland river ship detection based on high-resolution remote sensing imagery.

TI  - Land Use Change at the Historical Tourist Attractions of Umm Qais, Jordan: GIS and Markov Chain Analyses
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Umm Qais is one of the largest historical tourist sites in Jordan. It is surrounded by different residential and urban activities. To identify and predict the land use changes that may threaten the historical tourist attractions of Umm Qais, this study utilized LANDSAT images of the area for the years 1985, 1991, 2006, 2010, and 2016 and forecasted the change in the years 1997, 2003, and 2022 to monitor the change in barren, agricultural, water, and urban areas. The image analysis and classification were carried out using ArcGIS 10.2 whereas Markov chain analysis was used for forecasting purposes. The results of the study predict that the urban areas will expand by about 21.55% in the year 2022 compared to the year 2016 (15.75%). In addition, agricultural areas will surge by about 35.91%. The expansion in the urban and agricultural areas is predicted to be at the expense of barren areas especially those close to the Umm Qais historical site. These land use changes will cause urban development encroachments onto the cultural landscape of the site. A number of recommendations and policy implications, regarding buffer zoning, land expropriation, stakeholders' involvement, and legislation, are suggested to mitigate the impacts of the current and future urban development activities.

TI  - Modeling soil salinity using direct and indirect measurement techniques: A comparative analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a major problem for low-elevation countries like Bangladesh and is expected to worsen due to global warming and associated sea level rise. A constant monitoring of salinity affected areas is imperative to prevent land degradation, agricultural and livelihood losses. With this aim, we developed three soil salinity models with direct, indirect and a combination of both of these soil salinity measurement techniques, for south-western Bangladesh. The five salinity indexes (direct) and eleven environmental variables (indirect) were integrated using Principal Component Analysis, and the predictability of the models was evaluated against ground-based soil salinity measurements from soil survey and land cover maps generated during the model development. Delineation based solely on salinity indexes yielded results that contradicted with models developed from indirect variables and combining all the variables. Results suggest that the salinity model developed by combining direct and indirect techniques has the highest prediction capacity and can also be explained in terms of land cover changes. Therefore, an integrated approach yielded better delineation of salt-affected areas, characterized by active hydrological processes and vegetation cover. The findings and maps produced from this study would provide a new contextual planning tool to policymakers, for devising adaptation strategies in affected areas of Bangladesh.

TI  - Sentinel-2 accurately maps green-attack stage of European spruce bark beetle (<i>Ips typographus</i>, L.) compared with Landsat-8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural disturbances induced by insect outbreaks have increased in forest ecosystems over the past decades. To minimize economic loss and prevent a mass outbreak, early detection of bark beetle green attack - a period when trees have yet to show visual signs of infestation stress - is therefore crucial to effective and timely forest management. In this study, we evaluated the ability of spectral vegetation indices extracted from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery to map bark beetle green attack using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square discriminate analysis (PLS-DA). A recent infestation map produced through visual interpretation of high-resolution aerial photographs validated the final infestation output maps. Leaf spectral measurements along-side total chlorophyll and nitrogen concentration, leaf water content and leaf dry matter content were measured to assess the impact of bark beetle green attack on foliar properties. We observed that the majority of spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) calculated from Sentinel-2, particularly red-edge dependent indices (NDRE 2 and 3) and water-related indices (SR-SWIR, NDWI, DSWI and LWCI), were able to discriminate healthy from infested plots. In contrast, only the water-related indices (NDWI, DSWI and RDI) from Landsat-8 were able to discriminate between healthy and infested plots efficiently. The total number of pixels identified as harboring a green attack that matched with ground truth data (aerial photography) was higher for Sentinel-2 (67%) than for Landsat-8 (36%) SVIs, indicating the elevated sensitivity of Sentinel-2 imagery to changes induced by bark beetle green attack. We also determined that foliar chlorophyll and leaf water content were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in healthy trees than in green-attacked trees. Our study highlights the potential of Sentinel-2 data for the early detection of bark beetle infestations and the production of reliable infestation maps at the green-attack stage.

TI  - Land-Use/Land-Cover Change Analysis and Urban Growth Modelling in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A rapid increase in the world's population over the last century has triggered the transformation of the earth surface, especially in urban areas, where more than half of the global population live. Ghana is no exception and a high population growth rate, coupled with economic development over the last three decades, has transformed the Greater Accra region into a hotspot for massive urban growth. The urban extent of the region has expanded extensively, mainly at the expense of the vegetative cover in the region. Although urbanization presents several opportunities, the environmental and social problems cannot be underestimated. Therefore, the need to estimate the rate and extent of land use/land cover changes in the region and the main drivers of these changes is imperative. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing techniques provide effective tools in studying and monitoring land-use/land-cover change over space and time. A post classification change detection of multiple Landsat images was conducted to map and analyse the extent and rate of land use/land cover change in the region between 1991 and 2015. Subsequently, the urban extent of the region was forecasted for the year 2025 using the Markov Chain and the Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network, together with drivers representing proximity, biophysical, and socio-economic variables. The results from the research revealed that built-up areas increased by 277% over the 24-year study period. However, forest areas experienced massive reduction, diminishing from 34% in 1991 to 6.5% in 2015. The 2025 projected land use map revealed that the urban extent will massively increase to cover 70% of the study area, as compared to 44% in 2015. The urban extent is also anticipated to spill into the adjoining districts mainly on the western and eastern sides of the region. The success of this research in generating a future land-use map for 2025, together with the other significant findings, demonstrates the usefulness of spatial models as tools for sustainable city planning and environmental management, especially for urban planners in developing countries.

T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing human-induced developmental activities around the Eti-Osa coastal area of Lagos state, Nigeria has continued to trigger social and environmental challenges that have not been given desired attention. The study therefore attempted to utilize Landsat TM 1984, ETM+ 2000, and OLI 2013 to estimate the changes in the land use/land cover categories using GIS techniques, economic valuation method, and monetary valuation model to estimate the ecosystem service loss. The result showed that the built-up increased by 973.63Ha between 1984 and 2013 while 6717.65Ha, 1314Ha, and 1740.49Ha of mangrove, wetland, and water bodies respectively were lost to land reclamation. In monetary term, the study established ecosystem service loss of US$101.59 million per annum for the study period. It further estimated ecosystem service loss caused by damage to mangrove and food supply services at US$113.77 million and US$21.83 million per annum respectively. It was observed that land reclamation activity for urban and industrial uses has significant effect on the ecosystem service loss. By implication, socio-economics of the inhabitants were impacted by drastic decline in the income accrued from fishing activities and collapsing infrastructure arising from unsustainable land use activities through land reclamation and emerging flooding. The study advocates adoption of rigorous ecosystem resource accounting in subsequent environmental impact analyses on all future land-reclamation projects.

AB  - No human infections due to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N8) or A(H5N6) viruses - detected in wild birds and poultry outbreaks in Europe - have been reported so far and the risk of zoonotic transmission to the general public in Europe is considered very low. Between 16 November 2018 and 15 February 2019, two HPAI A(H5N8) outbreaks in poultry establishments in Bulgaria, two HPAI A(H5N6) outbreaks in wild birds in Denmark and one low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H5N3) in captive birds in the Netherlands were reported in the European Union (EU). Genetic characterisation of the HPAI A(H5N6) viruses reveals that they cluster with the A(H5N6) viruses that have been circulating in Europe since December 2017. The wild bird species involved were birds of prey and were likely infected due to hunting or scavenging infected wild waterfowl. However, HPAI virus was not detected in other wild birds during this period. Outside the EU, two HPAI outbreaks were reported in poultry during the reporting period from western Russia. Sequence information on an HPAI A(H5N6) virus found in a common gull in western Russia in October 2018 suggests that the virus clusters within clade 2.3.4.4c and is closely related to viruses that transmitted zoonotically in China. An increasing number of outbreaks in poultry and wild birds in Asia, Africa and the Middle East was observed during the time period for this report. Currently there is no evidence of a new HPAI virus incursion from Asia into Europe. However, passive surveillance systems may not be sensitive enough if the prevalence or case fatality in wild birds is very low. Nevertheless, it is important to encourage and maintain a certain level of passive surveillance in Europe testing single sick or dead wild birds and birds of prey as they may be sensitive sentinel species for the presence of HPAI virus in the environment. A well-targeted active surveillance might complement passive surveillance to collect information on HPAI infectious status of apparently healthy wild bird populations.

TI  - Analysis of forest fire and climate variability using Geospatial Technology for the State of Telangana, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIO-ECONOMIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic changes in the regimes of forest fires are due to the severity of climate and weather factors. The aim of the study was to examine the trend of forest fires and to evaluate their relationship with climate parameters for the state of Telangana in India. The climate and forest fire data were used and uploaded to the GIS platform in a specified vector grid (spacing: 0.3 degrees x 0.3 degrees). The data were evaluated spatially and statistical methods were applied to examine any relationships. The study revealed that there was a 78% incidence of forest fires in the months of February and March. The overall forest fire hotspot analysis (January to June) of grids revealed that the seven highest forest fire grids retain fire events greater than 600 were found in the north east of Warangal, east of Khammam and south east of Mahbubnagar districts. The forest fire analysis significantly followed the month wise pattern in grid format. Ten grids (in count) showed a fire frequency greater than 240 in the month of March and of these, three grids (in count) were found to be common where the forest fire frequency was highest in the preceding month. Rapid seasonal climate/weather changes were observed which significantly enhanced the forest fire events in the month of February onwards. The solar radiation increased to 159% in the month of March when compared with the preceding month whereas the relative humidity decreased to 47% in the same month. Furthermore, the wind velocity was found to be highest (3.5 meter/sec.) in the month of February and precipitation was found to be lowest (2.9 mm) in the same month. The analysis of Cramer V coefficient (CVC) values for wind velocity, maximum temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity and precipitation with respect to fire incidence were found to be in increasing order and were in the range of 0.280 to 0.715. The CVC value for precipitation was found to be highest and equivalent to 0.715 and showed its strongest association/relationship with fire events. The significant increase in precipitation not only enhances the moisture in the soil but also in the dry fuel load lying on the forest floor which greatly reduces the fuel burning capacity of the forest. The predicted (2050) temperature anomalies data (RCP-6) for the month of February and March also showed a significant increase in temperature over those areas where forest fire events are found to be notably high in the present scenario which will certainly impact adversely on the future forest fire regime. Findings from this study have their own significance because such analyses/relationships have never be examined at the state level, therefore, it can help to fulfill the knowledge gap for the scientific community and the state forest department, and support fire prevention and control activities. There is a need to replicate this study in future by taking more climate variables which will certainly give a better understanding of forest fire events and their relationships with various parameters. The satellite remote sensing data and GIS have a strong potential to analyze various thematic datasets and in the visualization of spatial/temporal paradigms and thus significantly support the policy making framework.

TI  - Fire risk assessment along the climate, vegetation type variability over the part of Asian region: a geospatial approach
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, we evaluated the long term MODIS fire counts with the grid spacing 1 degrees x1 degrees over the part of continent of Asia. The grid show high percent of fire events was assigned to high risk grid. The study further evaluated three selected 2x2 window representing the risk grid. We have analyzed the fire events along various vegetation types as well as country boundary. The climate data set is further analyzed and statistical analysis was performed to understand the relationship with fire events. The first selected 2x2 window grid roughly represents over region of Punjab and Haryana state of India show 83% of total fire in the month of October and November due to agricultural residues burning. The result of the analysis of vegetation types with fire events manifest the vegetation types dominated by shifting cultivation which occupies the geographical area of 8% whereas they retain fire percent equivalent of 30% of total fire events. Country based fire events analysis shows that Burma fire events per unit geographical area were found roughly 3.5 times higher when compared with India. The analysis of fire events and climate data from February to July in grids over a part of the Asian region (central part of India) exhibit the 50% fire events was in the month of March with maximum temperature (degrees C), precipitation (mm) and solar radiation (KJ/m(2)/day) with range of (26.7-35.9), (6-26) and (22680-24366) respectively. The evaluation of Crammer's V coefficient (CVC) values of precipitation, mean maximum temperature and solar radiation are found in decreasing order and in the range of 0.77-0.31. The highest CVC value of precipitation (0.77) shows that among all other climatic parameters the precipitation has very strong relationship to fire events. Remote sensing data (fire and climate) when coupled with various analyses in GIS domain reflect better understanding of their relationship which will greatly help in management/planning/ making strategy on fire prevention/control.

TI  - A study of knickpoint surveys and their likely association with landslides along the Hunza River longitudinal profile
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mass wasting and tectonic uplift are the major factors, responsible for reshaping the northern Pakistan that contains the world's most steeply inclined mountainous regions including: Karakoram, Himalayas, and Hindukush Ranges. The role of GIS and remote sensing is inevitable to study the river geomorphology for the identification and evaluation of different mass wasting processes. digital elevation models (DEMs) are frequently used to extract the longitudinal profile of the rivers to identify the knickpoints and their related geomorphic attributes. For this study, ASTER DEM of 30m spatial resolution satellite data was utilized to perform the geomorphological analysis of the longitudinal profile of the Hunza River in ArcGIS and Matlab environment. The Hunza River channel with having the watershed area of 13571km(2), has witnessed a number of historic landslide dams (i.e. Attabad, Ganesh and Boultar glacier, etc.) that blocked the main river channel at multiple sections in different episodes of time. These past landslides presumably preserved in the river channel as knickpoints at their respective locations. In this study, a total of 77 knickpoints were identified along the main stem of the river channel. The spatial locations of the extracted knickpoints and their normalized steepness index (ks) values were compared with the Hunza River landslide inventory map, lithologic contact, tectonic faults and historic landslides data. Furthermore, the likely role of these geomorphic factors was evaluated to ascertain their association with knickpoints formation. The results of this GIS-based geomorphic analysis of the river profile and subsequent field visit of the area revealed that the formation of landslide dams and their subsequent breaching is one of the major trigger factor of knickpoints along the channel. Such studies highlight the benefits of inexpensive remote sensing data and GIS tools to assess the likely role of various geomorphic features in the formation of significant knickpoints along the river profiles on a regional scale.

TI  - Evaluation of Satellite and Gauge-Based Precipitation Products through Hydrologic Simulation in Tigris River Basin under Data-Scarce Environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates four widely used satellite and gauged-based precipitation products for hydrological evaluation in the poorly gauged Tigris River basin (TRB), with an area of 445,656 km2, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model. The multiple precipitation data sources (PDSs) evaluated in this study include Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), Multisource Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration towards the Evaluation of water resources project (APHRODITE), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC) data. The SWAT model was calibrated using three approaches to identify more realistic parameters. Overall, APHRODITE could capture the spatiotemporal distributions of daily precipitation with a correlation coefficient of 0.65, root-mean square error of 0.62 mm, and percent bias of 19.1%. In addition, APHRODITE also captured the monthly streamflow with reasonably accuracy for selected streamflow stations in the TRB with mean Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of >0.65. Conversely, MSWEP overestimated and CPC underestimated the observed mean climatology, respectively, and had similar effects on monthly streamflow simulations. Among all the selected precipitation products, the relative performance of CPC is poor in comparison to other data sets.

TI  - Assessing the sustainability literacy of the Nigerian engineering community
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Being the lifeblood of socioeconomic progress, engineering is implicated in the unprecedented challenge of sustainability. The global engineering community devised sustainable engineering as a conceptual departure from conventional engineering practices. However, the extent to which the sustainability worldview has permeated the Nigerian engineering community remains unanswered. This paper is an attempt to answer the question of how sustainability literate are the members of the Nigerian engineering community. The paper undertakes an assessment of the sustainability literacy of the community with the aid of a stakeholder survey and a devised sustainability literacy test. Three criteria that are used to gauge the stakeholders' sustainability literacy are awareness of the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, score on the sustainability literacy test, and self-assessment of sustainability knowledge. Survey participants were recruited mainly from two federally-run Nigerian higher education institutions, and engineering professional associations. The assessment reveals an unsatisfactory performance of the Nigerian engineering stakeholders on all three sustainability literacy criteria. The results show that the majority of the students (81%), educators (67%), and practitioners (64%) were unaware of the UNDESD. The paper therefore highlights the need to improve the sustainability literacy of the Nigerian engineering community, possibly through a sustainability education intervention.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An integration of remote sensing and geophysical data was carried out in Odode-Idanre using Geographic Information System (GIS) approach with the aim of developing a landfill site selection map of the area. The area falls within the Precambrian Basement complex of southwestern Nigeria. The remote sensing involved the processing and interpretation of Landsat-7 EMT+image covering the study area and the data were used to produce the lineament, slope, drainage and land use maps of the area. The geophysical investigation involved the vertical electrical sounding (VES) technique using Schlumberger configuration with half electrode spacing (AB/2) varying from 1 to 65m, One hundred and one (101) soundings stations were occupied within the study area. The interpretation of the VES data was used to generate the geoelectric section and determine Dar Zarrouk parameters. The results were used to generate thematic overburden and the coefficient of anisotropy maps. The geoelectric sections generally identified four geologic/geoelectric sequences that comprise topsoil, weathered layer, fractured Basement and fresh Basement. The depth to the Basement is generally less than 10m. The multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) analysis were used to assign weights to slope, land use, drainage density, lineament density, coefficient of anisotropy and overburden thickness using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and this was used to produce the landfill suitability map. The area was classified into unsuitable, moderately suitable and suitable zones. The unsuitable areas cover about 21.9%, moderately suitable areas cover about 55% and the suitable areas cover about 23.1%. The suitable areas are scattered and discontinuous but predominant within the southern part of the area. For the development of waste dump site within the study area, it should be located within the southern part which was found to be suitable.

TI  - The Educational Value of Morbidity and Mortality Committee in a Hospital Setting
T2  - BAHRAIN MEDICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The Morbidity and Mortality Committee (MMC) review has a great educational value for physicians and medical students. In addition, it has a great impact on health improvement and healthcare delivery. All hospitals in Bahrain should establish an MMC to update their physicians and improve their services.The primary goal of reporting and reviewing morbidities and mortalities is to enhance patients' safety, care and prevent possible sentinel and adverse events. It is expected that hospital morbidities and mortalities would increase as the average human lifespan is increasing(1). Preventable morbidity or mortality could be due to iatrogenesis, human errors, and negligence(2).Codman, in the early 1900s, lost his staff privileges at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston because he initiated Morbidity and Mortality Conferences (MMC). His effort was resisted by all surgeons for economic reasons. The first recognized MMC was held in 1935. MMC use is now mandated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in human medicine3. MMC educational value could be shared through presentation and error/s analysis, dissemination of information4. In a teaching hospital, mandatory attendance of MMCs is an essential requirement of training.Members of the MMC should be familiar with Root Cause Analysis; the objective of which is to identify factors that contribute to adverse events. The common goal is to gain insight into causes, describe the adverse event, then ask "why" it happened; continue to ask "why" until the root cause is identified (may take more or less than five "whys"). It is essential to maintain focus on the process and not the personalities(5,6). In many countries and several medical institutions, MMCs have been embedded within the medical curriculum for medical training(7).Regular hospital morbidity and mortality meetings are educational tools useful for assessing the quality of care and patient safety.

TI  - Recrudescence of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Malaria in a Patient With Progressive Sarcoidosis
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although endemic malaria has largely been eradicated in the United States, cases still occur, often as a result of travel-related exposure. Although nearly all cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria occur within 3 months of exposure, in rare instances, symptoms manifest years after the sentinel infection because of compromise of immunity and parasite recrudescence. We describe a case of a 49-year-old woman with a history of childhood malaria and no recent travel history who presented with P. falciparum malaria in the setting of progressing pulmonary sarcoidosis. This case report highlights the role of advancing immune compromise status in malarial recrudescence. We also consider other potential avenues to explain howa patient might develop P. falciparum malaria in a nonendemic region in the absence of recent travel.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the safety, feasibility and oncological adequacy of the Percutaneous Surgical System- PSS in a consecutive series of low-risk endometrial cancer staging.Study Design: From May 2015 to April 2017, we prospectively performed 30 consecutive percutaneous staging for low/intermediate risk endometrial cancer (FIGO stage IA GI-G2, IB G1-G2, IA G3). All patients were divided in two different groups on the basis of surgical procedure received: Group A included patients submitted to radical Class A hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; Group B concerned patients that received a lymph nodal assessment also.Results: The time needed to install percutaneous instruments and suprapubic trocar was 4 min. (range 2-10). The recorded median operative time (0T) was 80 min. (range 65-120) for Gr.A and 143 min. (range 107-190) for Gr.B, in which the median time of lymph nodal assessment was 55 min. (range 20-76). The median time for hysterectomy was 60 min. (range 40-110) in all cases. Lymph nodal assessment was performed in 14 (46.6%) cases: 7 sentinel node mapping, 7 pelvic lymphadenectomy. No intraoperative complications or LPS/LPT conversions were recorded. Median discharge time was 2 days (range 1-4), 5 patients were discharged in 3rd post-op day, and only 1 patient was discharged in 4th day for fever. All patients conveyed high satisfaction with the cosmetic results. A progressive overall reduction of pain perception was observed at 24h after surgery. Median follow-up was of 14 months (range 12-36), no recurrences have been detected.Conclusions: PSS seems to be a feasible approach for endometrial cancer staging. Larger experiences and prospective comparative studies are important to assess our assumptions and further investigate the real benefits of percutaneous surgical system. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Spatial estimation of surface ozone concentrations in Quito Ecuador with remote sensing data, air pollution measurements and meteorological variables
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface ozone is problematic to air pollution. It influences respiratory health. The air quality monitoring stations measure pollutants as surface ozone, but they are sometimes insufficient or do not have an adequate distribution for understanding the spatial distribution of pollutants in an urban area. In recent years, some projects have found a connection between remote sensing, air quality and health data. In this study, we apply an empirical land use regression (LUR) model to retrieve surface ozone in Quito. The model considers remote sensing data, air pollution measurements and meteorological variables. The objective is to use all available Landsat 8 images from 2014 and the air quality monitoring station data during the same dates of image acquisition. Nineteen input variables were considered, selecting by a stepwise regression and modelling with a partial least square (PLS) regression to avoid multicollinearity. The final surface ozone model includes ten independent variables and presents a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.768. The model proposed help to understand the spatial concentration of surface ozone in Quito with a better spatial resolution.

AB  - The decolonisation of education debate has (re)surfaced in South Africa. It is acknowledged that decolonisation is a complex and multi-layered process (see Jansen 2017; Le Grange 2016; Le Grange 2018; Venter 2018; Mbembe 2015; CHE 2017). Clarification and understanding of the complex concepts such as Africanisation, Eurocentrism, Westernisation, colonialism, colonially, decolonialism and decoloniality also surfaced (see Jansen 2017; Le Grange 2016; Le Grange 2018; Maldonado-Torres 2007; Venter 2018; Mbembe 2015; CHE 2017). However, there is a silence in current discourses when it comes to teacher education (Saved, Motala & Hoffman 2017) and specifically Economics Teaching and Business Studies Teaching (EBST), since the focus of the decolonisation debate has been on higher education in general. Teacher education is afield that functions at the interface of higher education and schooling and therefore the complexity and context of the school system an)directly impact on teacher education programmes. Mbembe (2015:17) argues that most of the implications for decolonising higher education have to do with content and the extent of what is to be taught (curriculum reform). But, this does not mean that decolonising knowledge is simply about de-Westernisation or to reject Western epistemic contributions to the world (Mignolo 2011:82), or to reverse technological advancement, or simply turn back the clock and revert to old ways of doing (Le Grange 2016). Rather, it is about developing a "perspective which can allow us to see ourselves clearly, but always in relationship with ourselves and to other selves in the universe, non-humans included" (Mbembe 2015:24).The question is how the EBST curriculum, as part of an initial teacher education programme, can be decolonised. Not enough is known about the alignment of EBST k contextual and content knowledge in decolonising of teacher education. The aim of this article is to extend the conversation on decolonising of the curriculum by focusing on EBST disciplinary/content knowledge and the generation of contextually relevant knowledge. Young and Muller (2013:107-108) view disciplinary knowledge as "powerful knowledge" that is regarded as "reliable knowledge" and produced in "specialist knowledge communities" with "rules", "concepts" and "boundaries". Horden (2018) maintains that the powerfulness depicted by Young and Muller is also dependent on certain socio-epistemic and institutional conditions.Maistry and David (2018) are of the view that business education has shown an ideological bias, which is couched within a predominant neo-classical worldview that is mostly devoid of local (South) African realities. Moreover, firms in Africa have received little attention in mainstream business management literature (Barnard, Cuervo-Cazurra & Manning 2017). Barnard et at (2017:3) argue that there are different dimensions of the business world at play in Africa that we are only beginning to understand For example, traditional concepts such as ubuntu, an African concept which means "I only exist through my interaction with you", play an important institutional role in many African firms. Contemporary business in Africa takes place in a context where people are mindful of the relative recent history of colonialism (Barnard et al. 2017). The perpetuation of imperial or neo-colonial tendencies cannot be looked at in isolation from socio-economic realities. We argue that knowledge needs to be looked at in the context and history of colonialism and apartheid, and the overt and covert features of the (mis)management of power. The pre- and post-colonial eras have footprints in present day wealth inequality and a disposition that is rooted in institutions and organisations. Institutions and organisations are firmly entrenched in modern-day business and the economy, which enfold EBST content knowledge. Therefore the role of institutions is discussed, and examples put forward to illustrate its importance in EBST.We argue that insights into three aspects, namely, why history matters, asking guiding questions and modelling contextualized teaching, could provide guidelines for aligning contextual and content knowledge in teacher education. The first aspect relates to path dependency which broadly defines the way the patterns of the past tend to shape the future (North 1990). The history of colonial Africa has become a popular topic in the development and economics literature (Viegi 2016) and recently also in the literature on decolonisation of higher and school education in South Africa. At the higher education level broadly, there is the call for the recognition of African voices in the advancement and reproduction of knowledge (Mbembe 2015). At school level a specific call is made for the teaching of history from an Afrocentric view as opposed to a Eurocentric worldview (Motsega 2018). History is important since it gives insight into understanding current inequality and understanding of a particular mindset ofpre- and post-colonial eras we are still troubled by today. The importance of history and the coloniality of power are also deeply interwoven in institutions and organisations.The second aspect of contextualized teaching is to ask guiding questions such as "why do countries differ so much in development?" (Acemoglu & Robinson 2012). EBST teacher educators are often themselves not critical about the formal curriculum so as to mediate learning that raises questions about the conduct and decision-making of corporates. As is the case with most subjects, the question is which content is considered to be the most impacy'ul, how should it be taught and in which context. Asking pertinent questions about the impact of economic crises or key contemporary issues in (South) Africa, and challenging existing worldviews are important.The third aspect of contextualised teaching is to explicitly model contextualised thinking, which can be done through a path of learning which could facilitate "intervulturaliry: a process ofun-learn, re-learn and then move toward learning to undertaking" (De Carvalho & Florez-Florez 2014:134). Interculturality is an active process of transformation, which identifies the integrated relationships between persons or social groups of diverse worldviews and cultures. Selecting relevant EBST resource material is important, such as use of African case studies and the encouragement of Afrocentric innovations (Barnard et al. 2017). For years, the most accessible and dominant resources for EBST have been from a Western and/or Eurocentric worldview from which narratives revolve around a masculine, white, and liberal view of reality (Maistry & David 2018). Over the years, educators became dependent on these knowledge systems, epistemological traditions and curriculum materials. Applying knowledge that is also relevant to (South) African contexts can allow students to better make sense of the discipline within which they study. The implications for the EBST-curriculum is therefore two -fold: the inclusion of African perspectives and secondly, the integration of economic and business history in the curriculum.

TI  - Forest aboveground biomass estimation using machine learning regression algorithm in Yok Don National Park, Vietnam
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass is one of the key measurement for carbon budget accounting, carbon flux monitoring, and climate change studies. Hence, it is essential to develop a credible approach to estimate forest biomass and carbon stocks. Our study applied Sentinel-2 satellite imagery combined with field-measured biomass using Random Forest (RF), a machine learning regression algorithm, to estimate forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in Yok Don National Park, Vietnam. A total of 132 spectral and texture variables were extracted from Sentinel-2 imagery (February 7, 2017) to predict AGB of the National Park using RF algorithm. It was found that a combination of 132 spectral and texture variables could predict AGB with an R-2 value of 0.94, RMSE of 34.5 Mgha(-1) and % RMSE of 18.3%. RF regression algorithm was further used to reduce the number of variables in such a way that a minimum number of selected variables can be able to estimate AGB at a satisfactory level. A combination of 11 spectral and texture variables was identified based on out-of-bag (OOB) estimation to develop an easy-to-use model for estimating AGB. On validation, the model developed with 11 variables was able to predict AGB with R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 36.67 Mg ha(-1) and %RMSE of 19.55%. The results found in the present study demonstrated that Sentinel-2 imagery in conjunction with RF-based regression algorithm has the potential to effectively predict the spatial distribution of forest AGB with adequate accuracy.

TI  - Trends in Woody and Herbaceous Vegetation in the Savannas of West Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We assess 32 years of vegetation change in the West African Sudano-Sahelian region following the drought events of the 1970s and 1980s. Change in decadal mean rain use efficiency is used to diagnose trends in woody vegetation that is expected to respond more slowly to post-drought rainfall gains, while change in the slope of the productivity-rainfall relationship is used to infer changing herbaceous conditions between early and late periods of the time series. The linearity/non-linearity of the productivity-rainfall relationship and its impact on the interpretation of overall greening trends, and specific woody and herbaceous vegetation trends, is also examined. Our results show a mostly positive association between productivity and rainfall (69% of pixels), which can be best described as linear (32%) or saturating (37%). Choosing the best' model at a specific location using Akaike Information Criterion has no discernible effect on the interpretation of overall greening or herbaceous trends, but does influence the detection of trends in woody vegetation. We conclude that widespread recovery in woody vegetation is responsible for the post-drought greening phenomenon reported elsewhere for the Sahel and Sudanian sub-regions. Meanwhile, trends in herbaceous vegetation are less pronounced, with no consistent indication towards either herbaceous degradation or recovery.

TI  - Potential for local resection with sentinel node basin dissection for early gastric cancer based on the distribution of primary sites
T2  - GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBased on the sentinel node (SN) concept, function-preserving surgery with SN basin dissection (SNBD) can be performed for SN-negative early gastric cancers. Particularly, a resection area can be minimized when the SN basin and primary site are closely localized. The aim of this study was to compare probabilities of being candidates for local resection with SNBD based on tumor location among patients with early gastric cancer.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 358 patients who underwent surgery with SN mapping for gastric cancer in our institution from November 1999 to April 2014. The proportion of patients who had a localized single basin and the distributions of the SN basins and primary sites were investigated. Patients with single basin drainage excluding remote sentinel node basin were considered as candidates for local resection with SNBD.ResultsOf the 358 patients, 191 (53%) patients were considered eligible for local resection with SNBD. Patients with tumors located in the upper third of the stomach were more likely candidates for local resection than those with tumors in other locations (upper third, 68%; middle third, 50%; and lower third, 51%), whereas patients with tumors located in the anterior wall were less likely candidates than those with tumors other locations (anterior wall, 31%; posterior wall, 58%; greater curvature, 55%; and lesser curvature, 57%).ConclusionWe found that >50% of the patients indicated for SN navigation surgery, particularly those with tumors in the upper third of the stomach, potentially could undergo partial resection with SNBD.

TI  - GIS-based landslide susceptibility mapping using numerical risk factor bivariate model and its ensemble with linear multivariate regression and boosted regression tree algorithms
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a novel approach of the landslide numerical risk factor (LNRF) bivariate model was used in ensemble with linear multivariate regression (LMR) and boosted regression tree (BRT) models, coupled with radar remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS), for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in the Gorganroud watershed, Iran. Fifteen topographic, hydrological, geological and environmental conditioning factors and a landslide inventory (70%, or 298 landslides) were used in mapping. Phased array-type L-band synthetic aperture radar data were used to extract topographic parameters. Coefficients of tolerance and variance inflation factor were used to determine the coherence among conditioning factors. Data for the landslide inventory map were obtained from various resources, such as Iranian Landslide Working Party (ILWP), Forestry, Rangeland and Watershed Organisation (FRWO), extensive field surveys, interpretation of aerial photos and satellite images, and radar data. Of the total data, 30% were used to validate LSMs, using area under the curve (AUC), frequency ratio (FR) and seed cell area index (SCAI). Normalised difference vegetation index, land use/ land cover and slope degree in BRT model elevation, rainfall and distance from stream were found to be important factors and were given the highest weightage in modelling. Validation results using AUC showed that the ensemble LNRF-BRT and LNRFLMR models (AUC = 0.912 (91.2%) and 0.907 (90.7%), respectively) had high predictive accuracy than the LNRF model alone (AUC = 0.855 (85.5%)). The FR and SCAI analyses showed that all models divided the parameter classes with high precision. Overall, our novel approach of combining multivariate and machine learning methods with bivariate models, radar remote sensing data and GIS proved to be a powerful tool for landslide susceptibility mapping.

TI  - Correlation of 4-1BBL+B Cells in Tumor Draining Lymph Nodes with Pathological Characteristics of Breast Cancer
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: B cells can increase the expression of granzyme B in CD8(+) T cells through 4-1BBL/4-1BB interaction and promote anti-tumor immunity. Objective: To investigate the expression of 4-1BBL on B cells in the breast tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) and its association with disease parameters. Methods: Using Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation, mononuclear cells were isolated from axillary lymph nodes of 42 patients. Cells received 4 hours of PMA/Ionomycin stimulation, in vitro. Both unstimulated and stimulated cells were stained with anti-CD19 and anti-4-1BBL antibodies and subjected to flow cytometry. Results: 4-1BBL expression was detected on 2.8 +/- 1.7% of unstimulated B cells, while 27.4 +/- 11.9% of B cells expressed this co-stimulatory molecule following stimulation. In steady state, the percentage of 4-1BBL(+) B cells was not associated with cancer characteristics. However, in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma, the percentage of 4-1BBL expressing B cells in stimulated condition had a decreasing trend in grade III, compared to grade II+I. In addition, significantly higher frequency of 4-1BBL(+) B cells was seen in the TDLNs of ER+ or PR+ compared with ER- or PR- patients (p=0.021 and p=0.015, respectively). No significant associations were observed between the frequency of 4-1BBL(+) B cells and the number of involved LNs, Her2 expression or disease stage. Conclusions: The frequency of 4-1BBL(+) B cells significantly increased following a short time activation, and showed relative and significant associations with tumor grade and estrogen receptor status, respectively. More investigations are required to evaluate the potential of 4-1BBL(+) B cells for use in immunotherapy.

TI  - POTENTIAL ROLE OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SYSTEM CALL CENTRES IN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE OF SEASONAL INFLUENZA
T2  - CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Seasonal influenza causes high morbidity worldwide and high mortality in developing countries. As a result, the development of systems for seasonal influenza surveillance has been of great interest. The aim of this study is to explore the potential role of an Emergency Medical System (EMS) call centre to complement traditional surveillance systems of seasonal influenza.Methods: Retrospective observational study in which data on influenza from the system of Notifiable Diseases List (Spanish acronym EDO) and Sentinel Physicians Network (Spanish acronym RMC) were compared with information on calls made to the Principality of Asturias EMS call centre that covers all the region population (1,027,659 inhabitants) based on a set of specific criteria to determine differences and explore this emergency call system as a complementary epidemiological surveillance system. Cases registered by different systems have been compared to the same 68 weeks period, from week 45 of 2011 to week 8 of 2013.Results: RMC reported a total of 2,354 cases of influenza, EDO 43,071 cases and EMS call centre 4,360 "case calls" out of 180,720 total emergency calls. Case series of EDO and EMS call centre have shown a positive correlation (R = 0.42, p = 0.003). Case series from EMS call centre and RMC were correlated (R = 0.38, p = 0.007). Case series from EDO and RMC have shown a strong positive correlation (R = 0.91, p < 0.001). Correlation analysis of the cases reported by the three systems have shown a significant positive correlation between them (p < 0.001). The spike of EMS calls related to the studied influenza syndrome occurs one week in advance compared to traditional epidemiological surveillance systems.Conclusions: EMS call centre data on influenza could be potentially used as a complementary surveillance system to the traditional epidemiological surveillance systems for influenza.

TI  - Esoteric Imperialism: The Solomonic-Theurgic Mystique of John Dee's British Empire
T2  - ENDEAVOUR
M3  - Article
AB  - The life and works of the English Renaissance polymath John Dee (1527-1609) have been traditionally treated by scholarship in the context of the history of philosophy and science. Only in recent decades have two of John Dee's most prominent and controversial endeavors - (1) his political philosophy and advocacy of a British Empire (a term he is credited with coining), and (2) his long-standing practice of angelic magic - been reconstructed in their significance to Dee's worldview. This paper highlights how Dee's visions of a British Empire and his angelic rituals were not only major landmarks in his corpus, but were intimately interconnected in Dee's ideology of "Cosmopolitics." Dee's "esoteric imperialism" is situated in the context of his intellectual, textual, and political environment, and his angelic magic is identified as fitting within the medieval Solomonic current. It is argued that both ideological trends coalesced in Dee's vision of an angelic-inspired British Empire. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to analyze whether a combination of biomarkers at different levels of biological complexity could be used to assess the health status of a population of Brachidontes rodriguezii associated to a harbor area in Mar del Plata, Argentina. A battery of biomarkers of general stress was measured in mussels collected from impacted and non-impacted areas. This included: condition index; shell analysis; histopathological alterations; atrophy and integrity of the digestive gland tissue; changes in cell type composition of the digestive gland, and glycogen accumulation. The studied biomarkers were integrated into the Integrative Biological Response (IBR/n) index. Overall, the IBR/n indicated a higher level of stress in mussels located in the harbor area. Thus, this biomarker index is a sensitive analytical tool that could be used to classify the ecotox-icological risk in coastal sites.

TI  - Computerized evaluation scheme to detect metastasis in sentinel lymph nodes using contrast-enhanced computed tomography before breast cancer surgery
T2  - RADIOLOGICAL PHYSICS AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for evaluating lymph node metastasis during breast cancer surgery is associated with several problems, such as the consequent increase in operation time and the possibility of abrupt changes in the treatment plan during the operation. Although it is desirable to distinguish SLNs with and without cancer metastasis before surgery, there is no established examination for this purpose. This study aimed to develop a computerized scheme for evaluating metastasis in SLNs by analyzing computed tomography lymphography images and the three-dimensional versions of these images. Our database consisted of computed tomography lymphography images from 100 patients with breast cancer. Three subjective features of the nodes were assessed in the three-dimensional images: (1) the shape of the lymphoduct, (2) degree of signal enhancement in the nodes, and (3) shape of the nodes. Six objective features were also assessed in the computed tomography lymphography images: (4) the long axis, (5) area, (6) standard deviation of the signal values, (7) mean signal values, (8) maximum signal value, and (9) minimum signal value. Support vector machines were employed to evaluate cancer metastasis in SLNs. For the input, six of the nine features were selected in a stepwise method. The classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 98.0% (98/100), 97.8% (44/45), and 98.2% (54/55), respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 97.8% (44/45) and 98.2% (54/55), respectively. This computerized method exhibited high classification accuracy and will be useful in determining the need for lymph node dissection before breast cancer surgery.

TI  - Long-term sand dune spatio-temporal dynamics and endemic plant habitat extent in the Athabasca sand dunes of northern Saskatchewan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Athabasca sand dunes in northern Saskatchewan and north-east Alberta are a unique landscape of moving sand that hosts nine narrowly distributed endemic vascular plant taxa. We modeled the extent of habitat for each species, corresponding dune morphologies in species habitat, spatial and temporal variation in dune environments, and rates of woody vegetation encroachment at dune boundaries to support an assessment of long-term threats for the Athabasca endemic dune flora. Landsat images were used to maximize the time spans and areal coverage of the study. The Athabasca sand dunes are currently active and characterized morphologically by crescentic ridge and morphodynamically by transverse form dunes. Longitudinal sand movement parallel to the dune axis resulted in the creation of new dune areas along the east and south-east boundaries of the dune fields at a rate of 0.14 km(2) year(-1). Forest succession along the western boundaries of the dune fields resulted at an annual dune loss of 1.98 km(2) year(-1). The net extent of dune stabilization between 1985 and 2014 was 53.76 km(2) or nearly 20 percent of the total open sand dune extent. All habitat modeling methods showed robust performance (> 0.5 AUC), with the best performance in most cases from generalized linear models. Estimated total available/occupied habitat was comparatively low for the least abundant species Achillea millefolium (38.92 km(2)) and Armeria maritima (48.82 km(2)), and of those areas 53.5% and 16.29%, respectively, are influenced by dune stabilization. Continuing stabilization of the Athabasca sand dunes region may present conservation concerns for these narrowly distributed endemic taxa.

TI  - Long-Term Monitoring of Cork and Holm Oak Stands Productivity in Portugal with Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oak stands are declining in many regions of southern Europe. The goal of this paper is to assess this process and develop an effective monitoring tool for research and management. Long-term trends of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were derived and mapped at 30-m spatial resolution for all areas with a stable land cover of cork oak (Quercus suber L.) and holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) forests and agroforestry systems in mainland Portugal. NDVI, a good proxy for forest health and productivity monitoring, was obtained for the 1984-2017 period using Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery. TM values were adjusted to those of ETM+, after a comparison of site-specific and literature linear equations. The spatiotemporal trend analysis was performed using only July and August NDVI values, in order to minimize the spectral contribution of understory vegetation and its phenological variability, and thus, focus on the tree layer. Signs and significance of trends were obtained for six representative oak stands and the whole country with the Mann Kendall and Contextual Mann-Kendall test, respectively, and their slope was assessed with the Theil-Sen estimator. Long-term forest inventories of six study sites and NDVI time series derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) allowed validating the methodology and results with independent data. NDVI has a good relationship with cork production at the forest stand level. Pettitt tests reveal significant change-points within the trends in the period 1996-2005, when changes in drought patterns occurred. Twelve percent of the area of oak stands in Portugal presents significant decreasing trends, most of them located in mountainous regions with shallow soils. Cork oak agroforestry is the most declining oak forest type, compared to cork oak and holm oak forests. The Google Earth Engine platform proved to be a powerful tool to deal with long-term time series and for the monitoring of forests health and productivity.

TI  - Assessing the performance of a large-scale irrigation system by estimations of actual evapotranspiration obtained by Landsat satellite images resampled with cubic convolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques allow monitoring the Earth surface and acquiring worthwhile information that can be used efficiently in agro-hydrological systems. Satellite images associated to computational models represent reliable resources to estimate actual evapotranspiration fluxes, ETa, based on surface energy balance. The knowledge of EL and its spatial distribution is crucial for a broad range of applications at different scales, from fields to large irrigation districts. In single plots and/or in irrigation districts, linking water volumes delivered to the plots with the estimations of remote sensed ET. can have a great potential to develop new cost-effective indicators of irrigation performance, as well as to increase water use efficiency. With the aim to assess the irrigation system performance and the opportunities to save irrigation water resources at the "SAT Llano Verde" district in Albacete, Castilla-La Mancha (Spain), the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was applied on cloud-free Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images, processed by cubic convolution resampling method, for three irrigation seasons (May to September 2006, 2007 and 2008). The model allowed quantifying instantaneous, daily, monthly and seasonal ETA over the irrigation district. The comparison between monthly irrigation volumes distributed by each hydrant and the corresponding spatially averaged ETa, obtained by assuming an overall efficiency of irrigation network equal to 85%, allowed the assessment of the irrigation system performance for the area served by each hydrant, as well as for the whole irrigation district. It was observed that in all the investigated years, irrigation volumes applied monthly by farmers resulted generally higher than the corresponding evapotranspiration fluxes retrieved by SEBAL, with the exception of May, in which abundant rainfall occurred. When considering the entire irrigation seasons, it was demonstrated that a considerable amount of water could have been saved in the district, respectively equal to 26.2, 28.0 and 16.4% of the total water consumption evaluated in the three years.

TI  - Variability in atmospheric aerosols and effects of humidity, wind and InterTropical discontinuity over different ecological zones in Nigeria
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of humidity, wind, and InterTropical Discontinuity (ITD) movement on seasonal distribution of atmospheric aerosols were assessed over different ecological zones in Nigeria. Satellite-observed aerosol optical depth (AOD), humidity, wind speed, and precipitation/ITD data were used. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD time series of dataset were used. The MODIS AOD retrievals were at the wavelength of 550 nm and AOD data was re-scaled and sub-divided into seasonal and annual distributions to investigate the variations in Aerosol. Kriging spatial interpolation model was used to analyze the aerosol seasonal distribution. Correlations analysis was used to evaluate the degree of influence of humidity, wind speed, and precipitation/ITD on the seasonal distribution of aerosol over six ecological zones; Sahel, Sudan, Guinea, Rainforest, Freshwater, and Mangrove zones in Nigeria. The results show that the AOD over Nigeria is influenced by meteorological factors, but much more influenced by dust source outside the country. AOD appears much more during Harmattan season than Wet and Dry seasons; with AOD >= 0.46, with considerable concentration in Sahel ecological zone than other ecological zones. The results show a strong significant relationship between aerosol distribution and meteorological, principally humidity with R-2 >= 0.65 @ p < 0.05. The study reveals that for daily variation of AOD, wind speed, humidity and precipitation as well as spatial distribution of dust source in and outside the country are important drivers.

TI  - Land surface temperature and heat fluxes over three cities in Niger Delta
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the implications of land use change on land surface temperature (LST) and heat fluxes over three cities in the Niger Delta region, using satellite data. The study was carried out in three major urban areas in the Niger Delta of Nigeria: Benin City, Port Harcourt and Warn. Both in situ and satellite climatological data were used in this study to estimate the variations in heat fluxes over different land use/land cover in three major urban areas around the Niger Delta region in Nigeria. The results showed a general increased in the mean LST, with an average of 1.43 degrees C increase between the year 2004 and 2015 over different urban land use. The estimated heat flux ranges from 30.55 to 102.05 W/m(2) in the year 2004 but increased ranges from 33.25 to 120.06 W/m(2) in the year 2015. The average heat flux was nearly 30.12 W/m(2) during wet season, but much higher during the dry season with average heat flux nearly 215.75 W/m(2). Increase in LST appeared to be a result of changes in landuse/landcover in the cities. The results further show that different land uses exhibit different degree of LST during both wet and dry seasons, with temperature nearly 2 degrees C higher in dry seasons compare to wet seasons. These results imply that urban expansion in the Delta has resulted in variation in boundary currents and higher temperatures in the cities area compared to their immediate rural areas. The major findings of this study are that urban climate, urban heat redistribution and other hydrosphere processes are determined by the change in land use. The study established the potential health implications of increasing in LST and heat flux in the cities. Though, lack of long-term and quality health data made it very difficult to attribute the expansion or resurgence of diseases to change in urban LST, the review of literature has shown that thermal conditions usually contributes to heat syndrome, one of the health issues in the cities.

TI  - Use of Fire-Extinguishing Balls for a Conceptual System of Drone-Assisted Wildfire Fighting
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the potential use of fire extinguishing balls as part of a proposed system, where drone and remote-sensing technologies are utilized cooperatively as a supplement to traditional firefighting methods. The proposed system consists of (1) scouting unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to detect spot fires and monitor the risk of wildfire approaching a building, fence, and/or firefighting crew via remote sensing, (2) communication UAS to establish and extend the communication channel between scouting UAS and fire-fighting UAS, and (3) a fire-fighting UAS autonomously traveling to the waypoints to drop fire extinguishing balls (environmental friendly, heat activated suppressants). This concept is under development through a transdisciplinary multi-institutional project. The scope of this paper encloses general illustration of this design, and the experiments conducted so far to evaluate fire extinguishing balls. The results of the experiments show that smaller size fire extinguishing balls available in the global marketplace attached to drones might not be effective in aiding in building fires (unless there are open windows in the buildings already). On the contrary, results show that even the smaller size fire extinguishing balls might be effective in extinguishing short grass fires (around 0.5 kg size ball extinguished a circle of 1-meter of short grass). This finding guided the authors towards wildfire fighting rather than building fires. The paper also demonstrates building of heavy payload drones (around 15 kg payload), and the progress of development of an apparatus carrying fire-extinguishing balls attachable to drones.

M3  - Review
AB  - Penile squamous cell carcinoma is a rare cancer in men. The main prognosticators of survival for penile cancer patients remain the presence and the extent of lymph node metastasis. While radical inguinal lymphadenectomy has been the cornerstone of regional lymph node management for many years, it is still associated with significant morbidity and psychological distress. Recent developments in penile squamous cell carcinoma management have been met with some controversy in the urologic oncology community. Herein, we review the current controversies and developments on the role of inguinal lymphadenectomy for penile cancer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Low-value care in Australian public hospitals: prevalence and trends over time
T2  - BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To examine 27 low-value procedures, as defined by international recommendations, in New South Wales public hospitals.Design Analysis of admitted patient data for financial years 2010-2011 to 2016-2017.Main outcome measures Number and proportion of episodes identified as low value by two definitions (narrower and broader), associated costs and beddays, and variation between hospitals in financial year 2016-2017; trends in numbers of low-value episodes from 2010-2011 to 2016-2017.Results For 27 procedures in 2016-2017, we identified 5079 (narrower definition) to 8855 (broader definition) episodes involving low-value care (11.00%-19.18% of all 46 169 episodes involving these services). These episodes were associated with total inpatient costs of $ A49.9 million (narrower) to $ A99.3 million (broader), which was 7.4% (narrower) to 14.7% (broader) of the total $ A674.6 million costs for all episodes involving these procedures in 2016-2017, and involved 14 348 (narrower) to 29 705 (broader) bed-days. Half the procedures accounted for less than 2% of all low-value episodes identified; three of these had no low-value episodes in 2016-2017. The proportion of low-value care varied widely between hospitals. Of the 14 procedures accounting for most low-value care, seven showed decreasing trends from 2010-2011 to 2016-2017, while three (colonoscopy for constipation, endoscopy for dyspepsia, sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma in situ) showed increasing trends.Conclusions Low-value care in this Australian public hospital setting is not common for most of the measured procedures, but colonoscopy for constipation, endoscopy for dyspepsia and sentinel lymph node biopys for melanoma in situ require further investigation and action to reverse increasing trends. The variation between procedures and hospitals may imply different drivers and potential remedies.

TI  - Galileo and Trent The Dispute about Galileo's Written Hermeneutics (1614-1616) from a "tridentine Perspective"
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR THEOLOGIE UND KIRCHE
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay explores the early conflict surrounding Galileo's hermeneutics from four Tridentine or Post-Tridentine perspectives, viz. hermeneutical, exegetical, dogmatic, and pietistic. (1) In the first place, Galileo's historicizing theory of accommodation (a well-known concept in Post-Tridentine theology that designates God adjusting his revelation so as to be comprehensible within the restrictions of the human mind) is shown to be itself but a gradual development of Post-Tridentine hermeneutics. (2) Secondly, consideration is given to the exegetical work of the Jesuit Nicolai Serarius. In his commentary on Joshua 10, which illustrates how the Copernican worldview was perceived as threatening to undermine the authoritative Latin text of the Vulgate, Serarius is concerned with defending the literal sense of the text against what was seen as a direct challenge to not only the authoritative text but to the very understanding of Latin semantics. (3) Thirdly, as becomes clear from a reading of Bellarmin's Disputationes, the dispute regarding Galileo is to be understood primarily in polemic terms relating to the unity of Scripture and the papal church's monopoly on its infallible interpretation. (4) Finally, it is illustrated from the mystical work of Bellarmin, De Ascensione, that there existed a sharp conflict between scientific and pious mentality pertaining to matters of exegesis and the understanding of man's relation to the cosmos on the one hand and the divine on the other. These four perspectives help to contextualise the controversy surrounding Galileo and aid a clearer understanding of the reactions to his hermeneutics within the framework of the early 17th century.

TI  - A GIS and object based image analysis approach to mapping the greenspace composition of domestic gardens in Leicester, UK
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenspace provides a range of environmental benefits for urban residents, and is considered an important resource in urban development strategies. However, city-wide greenspace benefit modelling approaches often overestimate greenspace within garden areas, or even omit gardens from such analysis. As combined garden areal extents are significant for UK urban areas, improved estimations of garden greenspace abundance are required to improve urban greenspace analysis. This study investigates the methodological implications of a GIS and Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) remote sensing approach with very high resolution Worldview-2 imagery for classifying UK urban garden surfaces. Gardens for an approximate 7 km(2) study area of the city of Leicester, UK were classified with an overall accuracy similar to 86%. The study demonstrates the applicability of GIS and OBIA analysis for mapping UK urban garden surfaces, with the methodology detailed here useful as a framework for further UK garden studies. Improvements to the current methodology are also considered in lieu of data and methodological limitations. In addition, the resulting garden surface dataset was analysed to examine associations of garden greenspace proportions with physical garden characteristics. Low greenspace proportions are found to be particularly prevalent for Victorian Terraced housing types in the study area; with greenspace proportions also generally associated positively with garden areal extents. Identification of potential predictive characteristics for garden greenspace abundance may prove useful as proxy information for urban greenspace analysis in other UK urban areas.

TI  - Long-Range Transport of Mineral Dust to the Northeast Indian Ocean: Regional versus Remote Sources and the Implications
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Synergizing satellite remote sensing data with vertical profiles of atmospheric thermodynamics and regional climate model simulations, we investigate the relative importance, transport pathways, and seasonality of contribution of dust from regional (Thar Desert and adjoining arid regions) and remote (southwest Asia and northeast Africa) sources over the northeast Indian Ocean [i.e., the Bay of Bengal (BOB)]. We show that while over the northern BOB dust from the regional sources contribute more than 50% to the total dust load during the southwest monsoon period (June-September), interestingly; the remote dust sources dominate rest of the year. On the other hand, over the southern BOB, dust transported from the remote-source regions dominate throughout the year. During June, the dry elevated layer (at altitudes between 850 and 700 hPa) of dust, transported across the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the northern BOB, arises primarily from the Thar Desert. Dust from remote sources in the far west reaches the southern BOB after traversing over and around the southern Indian Peninsula. Since dust from these distinct source regions have different mineral composition (hence optical properties) and undergo distinct changes during atmospheric transport, it is important to understand source-specific dust contribution and transport pathways to address dust-climate feedback.

TI  - Sentinel node biospy using intravital blue dye An useful technique for identification of skip metastases in gastric cancer
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - As the lymph node status remains the main prognostic factor of gastric cancer (GC), several lymph node-based staging systems have been recently proposed for an appropriate postoperative therapy. The identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) might improve the postoperative protocols. The aim of this study was to present our experience in detecting SLNs in GC using methylene blue dye.We have performed an observational study and retrospectively analyzed all of the consecutive cases of GC operated by the same surgical team and managed by the same pathologists during 2013 to 2015. In all of the cases SLN status was determined using the methylene blue that was intraoperatively administered in the peritumoral subserosal tissue. All blue colored nodes were histopathologically examined. In the node negative cases immunohistochemical stains using AE1/AE3 keratin were performed.The blue SLNs were identified in 48 out of the 50 cases included in the study, with a 96% sensitivity and 87.50% specificity. From the 48 cases, 34 (70.83%) presented positive SLNs; in the other 14 cases the SLNs were negative (29.17%). False negativity was observed in 6 of the 14 cases. In 2 of the cases the false negativity of the group 20 was induced by the anthracotic pigment. In other 2 false negative cases, although no regional metastases were founded, sentinel skip metastases in the group 8 and 15, respectively, were identified.Mapping of the SLNs is a simple and cheap method that might improve the accuracy of LN-based staging of patients with GC and favor identification of skip metastases.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment of Bio-optical Models to Retrieve Backscattering Coefficients in Case 1 Waters of the Bay of Bengal
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The backscattering coefficient (b(b)) has been obtained either in situ observations/measurements or semi-analytical/analytical and empirical algorithms that depend on the relationship between 'b(b)' and the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). Several models were developed to estimate backscattering coefficient from the satellite imagery. The present study aims to assess the accuracy of bio-optical models and infer the best suitable model for Ocean Colour Monitoring (OCM-2) and for the upcoming OCM-3 sensors of Indian Space Research Organization. For this purpose, the bio-optical algorithms/models such as quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA), QAA version 5, Generalized Inherent Optical Properties (GIOP) and optimization of semi-analytical models in case 1 waters of the Bay of Bengal (BoB) were considered. For this analysis, three satellite sensors Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and OCM-2 datasets has been used to assess the model's accuracy. The results showed that the optimization technique performs better (bias = 0.002, 0.179 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 8%, 20%) for MODIS-A and OCM-2, respectively, whereas GIOP performs better (bias = 0.08, RMSE = 14%) for VIIRS in case 1 waters of the BoB. From the statistical analysis of each model for all stations, it is recommended to use the optimization technique rather than GIOP technique for estimation of satellite based 'b(b)' in Indian waters.

TI  - Simulating the effects of weather and climate on large wildfires in France
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Large wildfires across parts of France can cause devastating damage which puts lives, infrastructure, and the natural ecosystem at risk. In the climate change context, it is essential to better understand how these large wildfires relate to weather and climate and how they might change in a warmer world. Such projections rely on the development of a robust modeling framework linking large wildfires to present-day atmospheric variability. Drawing from a MODIS product and a gridded meteorological dataset, we derived a suite of biophysical and fire danger indices and developed generalized linear models simulating the probability of large wildfires ( > 100 ha) at 8 km spatial and daily temporal resolutions across the entire country over the last two decades. The models were able to reproduce large-wildfire activity across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Different sensitivities to weather and climate were detected across different environmental regions. Long-term drought was found to be a significant predictor of large wildfires in flammability-limited systems such as the Alpine and southwestern regions. In the Mediterranean, large wildfires were found to be associated with both short-term fire weather conditions and longer-term soil moisture deficits, collectively facilitating the occurrence of large wildfires. Simulated probabilities on days with large wildfires were on average 2-3 times higher than normal with respect to the mean seasonal cycle, highlighting the key role of atmospheric variability in wildfire spread. The model has wide applications, including improving our understanding of the drivers of large wildfires over the historical period and providing a basis on which to estimate future changes to large wildfires from climate scenarios.

TI  - A comparison of mosquito densities, weather and infection rates of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> during the first epidemics of Chikungunya (2014) and Zika (2016) in areas with and without vector control in Puerto Rico
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Puerto Rico, the first records of the transmission of Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses were confirmed in May 2014 and December 2015, respectively. Transmission of CHIKV peaked in September 2014, whereas that of ZIKV peaked in August 2016. The emergence of these mosquito-transmitted arboviruses in the context of a lack of human population immunity allowed observations of whether the outbreaks were associated with Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) densities and weather. Mosquito density was monitored weekly in four communities using sentinel autocidal gravid ovitraps (AGO traps) during 2016 in order to provide data to be compared with the findings of a previous study carried out during the 2014 CHIKV epidemic. Findings in two communities protected against Ae. aegypti using mass AGO trapping (three traps per house in most houses) were compared with those in two nearby communities without vector control. Mosquito pools were collected to detect viral RNA of ZIKV, CHIKV and dengue virus. In areas without vector control, mosquito densities and rates of ZIKV detection in 2016 were significantly higher, similarly to those observed for CHIKV in 2014. The density of Ae. aegypti in treated sites was less than two females/trap/week, which is similar to the putative adult female threshold for CHIKV transmission. No significant differences in mosquito density or infection rates with ZIKV and CHIKV at the same sites between years were observed. Although 2016 was significantly wetter, mosquito densities were similar.

TI  - Rates of osteoporosis screening and treatment following vertebral fracture
T2  - SPINE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Osteoporosis remains an underrecognized and undertreated disease entity in the orthopaedic setting, accounting for substantial long-term morbidity and mortality. Osteoporosis is often not diagnosed or treated until multiple fractures have occurred. Vertebral compression fractures are the most common sentinel fracture, providing an opportunity to intervene with antiresorptive therapy before more debilitating fractures occur. Little data has been published on osteoporosis screening and treatment following vertebral fractures. Further elucidation of the osteoporosis care gap in these patients is warranted.PURPOSE: To demonstrate the current state of post vertebral fracture osteoporosis management at a large tertiary care center with no established secondary fracture prevention program.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.SETTING: A large tertiary care hospital or one of its affiliated community hospitals.PATIENT SAMPLE: All 2,933 patients, 50 years of age or older, who presented to an emergency department with a new vertebral fracture between 2008 and 2014.OUTCOME MEASURES: The physiological measures are rates of new fractures within 2 years following first vertebral fracture.PATIENT CARE METRICS: Post vertebral fracture rates of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) testing, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and pharmacotherapy for osteoporosis within 1 year postfracture, and more than 1 year postfracture. Linear trend of the rate of new antiosteoporosis pharmacotherapy among previously antiosteoporosis medication naive patients within 1 year of fracture over time from 2008 to 2014.METHODS: All patients aged 50 years or older presenting to an emergency department with a vertebral fracture between 2008 and 2014 were included. Only an individual's first documented vertebral fracture was considered. Individuals were assessed for DXA screening, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, treatment with an antiosteoporosis medication, and additional fractures following incident vertebral fracture. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and a simple logistic regression. No specific funding was provided for this study. The authors of this study report no relevant financial conflicts of interests or associated biases.RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2014, 2,933 unique patients were seen at an included emergency department for one or more vertebral fracture encounters. Ninety-eight percent did not receive a DXA scan within the preceding 2 years or 1 year following fracture. Seven percent of patients were started on antiresorptive therapy after their fracture, with 341 (5%) starting within 1 year of fracture and 211 (2%) starting thereafter. Twenty-one percent (n=616) had taken an antiresorptive medication before their fracture. Seventy three percent (n=2,128) were never prescribed antiresorptive therapy. Treatment rates slightly decreased over time. Thirty eight percent of patients presenting with a vertebral fracture (n=1,115) went on to develop a second fragility fracture within 2 years.CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of a specific local program to improve secondary fracture prevention following minimal trauma spinal fractures, recognition and treatment of osteoporosis in patients at this institution remained dismal over time despite numerous calls to action on the topic in the orthopaedic literature and elsewhere. Undertreatment of osteoporosis puts patients at increased risk of incurring additional fractures. Within 2 years, 38% of the patients in this sample developed an additional fragility fracture. This study demonstrates a profound post vertebral fracture osteoporosis care gap. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Understanding Design Vulnerabilities in the Physical Environment Relating to Patient Fall Patterns in a Psychiatric Hospital: Seven Years of Sentinel Events
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC NURSES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The influence of the physical environment on patient falls has not been fully explored in psychiatric units, despite this patient population's vulnerability and the critical role of the physical environment in patient safety. AIMS: The research objective is to describe the spatial and temporal pattern of falls occurrences and their location in relation to the levels of safety continuum model. METHOD: This article presents an exploratory case study design. Seven years of retrospective data on patient falls, yielding 818 sentinel events, in an 81-bed psychiatric hospital in the United States were collected and analyzed. Data focused on extrinsic factors for falls, emphasizing the physical environment. Through a content analysis of the sentinel event narratives, recorded by the hospital staff, this study explored patient falls related to location and elements of the physical environment. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that 15% of recorded falls were attributed to some aspect of or element within the physical environment. The most typical locations of falls were patient rooms (39%), patient bathrooms (22%), and dayrooms (20%). Also, the results identified patterns of environmental factors that appeared linked to increasing patients' susceptibility to falls. Risk factors included poor nighttime lighting, flooring surfaces that were uneven, and spaces that inadvertently limited visual access and supervision. CONCLUSIONS: The physical environment plays an often-unexamined role in fall events and specific locations. These results are deserving of further research on design strategies and applications to reduce patient falls in psychiatric hospital settings.

TI  - Generating WUDAPT Level 0 data - Current status of production and evaluation
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) project has grown out of the need for better information on the form and function of cities globally. Cities are described using Local Climate Zones (LCZ), which are associated with a range of key urban climate model parameters and thus can serve as inputs to high resolution urban climate models. We refer to this as level 0 data for each city.The LCZ level 0 product is produced using freely available Landsat imagery, crowdsourced training areas from the community, and the open source SAGA software. This paper outlines the protocol by which LCZ maps generated by different members of the community a7re produced and evaluated. In particular, the quality assessment comprises cross-validation, review, and cross-comparison with other data sets.To date, the results from the different quality assessments show that the LCZ maps are generally of moderate quality, i.e. 50-60% overall accuracy (OA), but this is much higher when considering all built-up classes together or using weights that take the morphological and climatic similarity of certain classes into account. The training data contributed by researchers from around the world also vary in quality and in the interpretation of the landscape, which affects the final quality of the LCZ maps.The acceptable level of quality needed will depend heavily on the application of the data. However, initial modelling studies that use the level 0 products as inputs showed improved performance in simulating the urban climate when replacing the default surface descriptions with the WUDAPT level 0 data. This is also promising for the application of level 0 data in regional and global climate and weather models and supports the assumption that the current level 0 products are already of sufficient quality for certain applications. Moreover, there are various ongoing developments to improve the methods used to produce LCZ maps and their accuracy.

TI  - A Benchmark of Statistical Models for Forecasting Monthly Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI) for the Region of Ouarzazate Morocco
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI) is the main component of solar thermal (ST) systems and concentrated solar power systems (CSP and CPV). The volatility of this component due its renewable resource nature can cause fluctuations that affect the electrical grid, hence the importance of forecasting it. In this work, he forecasting of monthly average Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI) is explored. A benchmark of statistical forecasting models is used to select the best statistical forecasting model. Seventeen models are evaluated and compared, namely Trend models, Box Jenks models and Exponential Smoothing models. The satellite data used are of the period extended from 1994 to 2012 for the region of Ouarzazate in Morocco. The daytime period is from 07h30 till 17h30. The design region of the models is from 1994 to 2009 divided into an estimation period and a validation period. Data from 2010 to 2012 are used as forecasting years. Several error metrics are used for performance evaluation and comparison. The results indicate that a seasonal ARIMA model outperforms the other statistical models with a MPE=-0.490442% in the validation period and MPE=-5.1907% in the forecasting region.

TI  - "Those for Whom This Civilization Has No Place": Reading Eugenics in Of Mice and Men
T2  - STEINBECK REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the prevalence of eugenics and determinist race-thinking during much of Steinbeck's working life, few critics have attempted to trace the echoes of that lineage in his work. Working within an interdiscplinary paradigm, I wish to argue that one of Steinbeck's oft-read and oft-analyzed novellas, Of Mice and Men, ought to be analyzed within the eugenic milieu of early twentieth-century America. Borrowing widely from intellectual history, philosophy, critical race theory, and labor studies, I present three distinct analytical channels for excavating the presence and activity of eugenic thinking in the novella. The first channel is a cosmological reading of the striking similarities between Steinbeck's non-teleological philosophy of "visceral understanding" and the worldview advanced by eugenicists-cum-political theorists Madison Grant and Lothrop Stoddard. The second is a micro-historical focus on California's role as a frontier for the institutionalization and practice of eugenics, a context that allows one to redefine some of Of Mice and Men's own narrative moments and structural relationships as marked by eugenic considerations and ethics. The third channel is a "geosophical" interpretation of the construction of the hobo archetype- which Lenny and George both fall under-in order to elucidate how hoboes and tramps become eugenically translated, a process of coding and identification of the unfit that signals to a coextensive precarity and revolutionary potential that "strange" and mobile persons embody within racially constituted spaces. In sum, much of my argument can be understood as turning around the effects and consequences of what would it mean to consider Of Mice and Men a eugenic novel in some sense.

TI  - Landslide hazard zonation mapping using multi-criteria analysis with the help of GIS techniques: a case study from Eastern Himalayas, Namchi, South Sikkim
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are one of the most damaging disastrous phenomena that frequently lead to serious problems in hilly areas. The Namchi region of South Sikkim district as a part of Eastern Himalayas is not an exception to it. In the present study, multi-criteria analysis technique is used for landslide hazard zonation mapping. Various thematic layers, namely slope, rainfall distribution map, lineament density, drainage density, slope aspect, geology, land use/land cover and soil map, were integrated in a GIS platform (ArcGIS 10.1) to delineate landslide hazard zone. Analytic hierarchy process was used to determine the weight values of different factors. Relative rating values are assigned for the subclasses of each thematic layer based on their corresponding impact on the landslide triggers, and within a thematic layer, each class was assigned an ordinal rating from 0 to 9. The landslide hazard zonation map of Namchi region was produced based on weighted overly techniques. The landslide hazard map of Namchi region is divided into five vulnerable zones, namely very low-, low-, moderate-, high- and very high-hazard zones. Resulted landslide hazard zonation map was further validated with field study and geospatial technology-based analysis. The findings demonstrate high-landslide-hazard zones are associated with areas of active erosive processes (steep slopes/cut slopes/lineaments). The results indicate the villages Bomtar, Jorethang, Kopchey, Donok, Namthang, Sumbuk, Longchok, Mamring, Turung, Mikkhola, etc. are highly prone to landslides. The final landslide hazard zonation map can be used for the landslide hazard prevention, proper planning of future infrastructure and geoenvironmental development in Namchi region.

TI  - The Influence of Region of Interest Heterogeneity on Classification Accuracy in Wetland Systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classifying and mapping natural systems such as wetlands using remote sensing frequently relies on data derived from regions of interest (ROIs), often acquired during field campaigns. ROIs tend to be heterogeneous in complex systems with a variety of land cover classes. However, traditional supervised image classification is predicated on pure single-class observations to train a classifier. This ultimately encourages end-users to create single-class ROIs, nudging ROIs away from field-based points or gerrymandering the ROI, which may produce ROIs unrepresentative of the landscape and potentially insert error into the classification. In this study, we explored WorldView-2 images and 228 field-based data points to define ROIs of varying heterogeneity levels in terms of class membership to classify and map 22 discrete classes in a large and complex wetland system. The goal was to include rather than avoid ROI heterogeneity and assess its impact on classification accuracy. Parametric and nonparametric classifiers were tested with ROI heterogeneity that varied from 7% to 100%. Heterogeneity was governed by ROI area, which we increased from the field-sampling frame of similar to 100 m(2) nearly 19-fold to similar to 2124 m(2). In general, overall accuracy (OA) tended downwards with increasing heterogeneity but stayed relatively high until extreme heterogeneity levels were reached. Moreover, the differences in OA were not statistically significant across several small-to-large heterogeneity levels. Per-class user's and producer's accuracies behaved similarly. Our findings suggest that ROI heterogeneity did not harm classification accuracy unless heterogeneity became extreme, and thus there are substantial practical advantages to accommodating heterogeneous ROIs in image classification. Rather than attempting to avoid ROI heterogeneity by gerrymandering, classification in wetland environments, as well as analyses of other complex environments, should embrace ROI heterogeneity.

TI  - A nomogram to identify high-risk melanoma patients with a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Melanoma patients with negative nodes after sentinel lymph node biopsy are a heterogeneous group. Current guidelines fail to adequately stratify surveillance and treatment for this group. Also, there is scarce data on adjuvant treatments for these patients.Objective: To create a nomogram including clinical and pathologic characteristics capable of evaluating the risk for recurrence of primary melanoma patients with negative sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNBs).Methods: We used a retrospective cohort of patients who underwent SLNB during 2000-2015 at a single institution.Results: Our cohort comprised 1213 patients. Among these patients, 967 (79.7%) had a negative SLNB, and mean follow-up was 59.67 months. There were 133 recurrences (13.8%); 45 (33.8%) presented with nodal recurrence, and 35 (26.3%) recurred where a SLNB was performed. Breslow thickness, ulceration, and microsatellitosis were found to be predictive of risk for recurrence at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years.Limitation: Single center analysis.Conclusion: We created a predictive nomogram for melanoma patients with negative SLNBs. This nomogram is easy to use and identifies high-risk patients who should have more strict surveillance and be considered for adjuvant treatment.

TI  - Trends and drivers of land use/land cover change in Western Ethiopia
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the magnitude, direction and agents of land use/land cover change (LU/LCC) are important for planning sustainable management of natural resources. To this end, this study assessed the trends of LU/LCC and its drivers in Western Ethiopia. Landsat images of MSS (1978), TM (1986, 1991 and 2010), ETM + (1999) and OLI (2013 and 2016) were used to study the dynamics of LU/LCC. The land use/land cover (LU/LC) maps for each period were classified using a hybrid method by merging the outputs of supervised classification and intensive on-screen-digitizing techniques. The drivers of LU/LCC were studied using key informant interviews (KII) and focus group discussions (FGD). Four major LU/LC types namely forest, agriculture, shrub/grass, and settlement were identified with overall accuracies ranging from 91% to 94%. The result shows that forest was the dominant LU/LC type accounting for 69% in 1978 which later reduced to 13, 8.5 and 6.5 percent point (pp) in 1991, 2010, and 2016, respectively. Shrub/grasslands were also reduced by 11 pp from 2010 to 2016. Expansion of agricultural land was the major driver showing a radical increase by 13 pp between 2013 and 2016. Forest cover showed a reduction of 28 pp over the 38 years of the study period. In particular, 21.3%, 26%, and 16.6% of the forest was converted to shrub/grassland from 1986 to 1991, 1991 to 2010 and 2010 to 2016, respectively. But from 2010 to 2016, 19.13% of forest was converted to agriculture. The study showed that forest was first changed to shrub/grasslands and finally end up in agriculture showing that degradation is leading to deforestation. The result of FGDs and KIIs also showed that both small-scale subsistence agriculture and largescale commercial agriculture are the major proximate drivers of deforestation in the study area. Population pressure from a multi-sourced and continued inflow of immigrants, lack of integrated institutional frameworks and unsustainable exploitations of forest products are the major underlying causes of the observed changes. Proper land use planning, legal backing, and institutional integration are key recommendations to sustain forest resources of the study area.

TI  - Are Slope Streaks Indicative of Global-Scale Aqueous Processes on Contemporary Mars?
T2  - REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Slope streaks are prevalent and intriguing dark albedo surface features on contemporary Mars. Slope streaks are readily observed in the equatorial and subequatorial dusty regolith regions with low thermal inertia. They gradually fade over decadal timescales. The proposed mechanisms for their formation vary widely based on several physicochemical and geomorphological explanations. The scientific community is divided in proposing both dry and wet mechanisms for the formation of slope streaks. Here we perform a systematic evaluation of the literature for these wet and dry mechanisms. We discuss the probable constraints on the various proposed mechanisms and provide perspectives on the plausible process driving global-scale slope streak formation on contemporary Mars. Although per our understanding, a thorough consideration of the global distribution of slope streaks, their morphology and topography, flow characteristics, physicochemical and atmospheric coincidences, and terrestrial analogies weighs more in favor of several wet mechanisms, we acknowledge that such wet mechanisms cannot explain all the reported morphological and terrain variations of slope streaks. Thus, we suggest that explanations considering both dry and wet processes can more holistically describe all the observed morphological variations among slope streaks. We further acknowledge the constraints on the resolutions of remote sensing data and on our understanding of the Martian mineralogy, climate, and atmosphere and recommend continuous investigations in this direction using future remote sensing acquisitions and simulations. In this regard, finding more wet and dry terrestrial analogs for Martian slope streaks and studying them at high spatiotemporal resolutions can greatly improve our understanding.

TI  - Flood Inundation Mapping of the Sparsely Gauged Large-Scale Brahmaputra Basin Using Remote Sensing Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable water management is one of the important priorities set out in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, which calls for efficient use of natural resources. Efficient water management nowadays depends a lot upon simulation models. However, the availability of limited hydro-meteorological data together with limited data sharing practices prohibits simulation modelling and consequently efficient flood risk management of sparsely gauged basins. Advances in remote sensing has significantly contributed to carrying out hydrological studies in ungauged or sparsely gauged basins. In particular, the global datasets of remote sensing observations (e.g., rainfall, evaporation, temperature, land use, terrain, etc.) allow to develop hydrological and hydraulic models of sparsely gauged catchments. In this research, we have considered large scale hydrological and hydraulic modelling, using freely available global datasets, of the sparsely gauged trans-boundary Brahmaputra basin, which has an enormous potential in terms of agriculture, hydropower, water supplies and other utilities. A semi-distributed conceptual hydrological model was developed using HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Modelling System from Hydrologic Engineering Centre). Rainfall estimates from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) was compared with limited gauge data and used in the simulation. The Nash Sutcliffe coefficient of the model with the uncorrected rainfall data in calibration and validation were 0.75 and 0.61 respectively whereas the similar values with the corrected rainfall data were 0.81 and 0.74. The output of the hydrological model was used as a boundary condition and lateral inflow to the hydraulic model. Modelling results obtained using uncorrected and corrected remotely sensed products of rainfall were compared with the discharge values at the basin outlet (Bahadurabad) and with altimetry data from Jason-2 satellite. The simulated flood inundation maps of the lower part of the Brahmaputra basin showed reasonably good match in terms of the probability of detection, success ratio and critical success index. Overall, this study demonstrated that reliable and robust results can be obtained in both hydrological and hydraulic modelling using remote sensing data as the only input to large scale and sparsely gauged basins.

TI  - Evaluation of Terra-MODIS C6 and C6.1 Aerosol Products against Beijing, XiangHe, and Xinglong AERONET Sites in China during 2004-2014
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Terra-MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Collections 6 and 6.1 (C6 & C6.1) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals with the recommended high-quality flag (QF = 3) were retrieved from Dark-Target (DT), Deep-Blue (DB) and merged DT and DB (DTB) level-2 AOD products for verification against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 3 Level 2.0 AOD data obtained from 2004-2014 for three sites located in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. These are: Beijing, located over mixed bright urban surfaces, XiangHe located over suburban surfaces, and Xinglong located over hilly and vegetated surfaces. The AOD retrievals were also validated over different land-cover types defined by static monthly NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) values obtained from the Terra-MODIS level-3 product (MOD13A3). These include non-vegetated surfaces (NVS, NDVI < 0.2), partially vegetated surfaces (PVS, 0.2 NDVI 0.3), moderately vegetated surfaces (MVS, 0.3 < NDVI < 0.5) and densely vegetated surfaces (DVS, NDVI 0.5). Results show that the DT, DB, and DTB-collocated retrievals achieve a high correlation coefficient of 0.90-0.97, 0.89-0.95, and 0.86-0.95, respectively, with AERONET AOD. The DT C6 and C6.1 collocated retrievals were comparable at XiangHe and Xinglong, whereas at Beijing, the percentage of collocated retrievals within the expected error (EE) increased from 21.4% to 35.5%, the root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 0.37 to 0.24, and the relative percent mean error (RPME) decreased from 49% to 27%. These results suggest significant relative improvement in the DT C6.1 product. The percentage of DB-collocated AOD retrievals EE was greater than 70% at Beijing and Xinglong, whereas less than 66% was observed at XiangHe. Similar to DT AOD, DTB AOD retrievals performed well at XiangHe and Xinglong compared with Beijing. Regionally, DB C6 and C6.1-collocated retrievals performed better than DT and DTB in terms of good quality retrievals and relatively small errors. For diverse vegetated surfaces, DT-collocated retrievals reported small errors and good quality retrievals only for NVS and DVS, whereas larger errors were reported for PVS. MVS. DB contains good quality AOD retrievals over PVS, MVS, and DVS compared with NVS. DTB C6.1 collocated retrievals were better than C6 over NVS, PVS, and DVS. C6.1 is substantially improved overall, compared with C6 at local and regional scales, and over diverse vegetated surfaces.

TI  - FDG/PET-CT-Based Lymph Node Atlas in Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to localize locoregional lymph node metastases using positron emission tomography with fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) data sets in a large cohort of patients and to evaluate the existing Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) clinical target volume (CTV) and the European Society for Radiation Therapy & Oncology (ESTRO) CTV contouring guidelines.Methods and Materials: A total of 235 patients with 580 FDG/PET-CT positive locoregional lymph node metastases were included in our analysis. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to their course of disease (primary vs recurrent breast cancer) and the presence or absence of distant metastasis at the time of the FDG-PET/ CT staging (distant metastasis vs no distant metastasis). All imaging data were imported into the planning system, and each lymph node was manually contoured. A patient with " standard anatomy" was chosen as a template, and all contoured structures were registered rigidly and nonrigidly to this patient. A comprehensive 3-dimensional atlas was created, including all identified lymph node metastases. The incidences of lymph node metastases were analyzed and are presented with color coding in the atlas. Lymph node levels (axillary, internal mammary, supraclavicular) were contoured according to RTOG and ESTRO guidelines and evaluated.Results: The mean volume of the lymph nodes was 1.7 +/- 2.6 cm(3) with an average diameter of 1.3 +/- 0.7 cm. Most lymph nodes were in level I (n = 316; 54.5%) followed by the supraclavicular region (n = 80; 13.8%), level II (n Z 57; 9.8%), level III (n = 58; 10.0%), and the internal mammary region (n = 55; 9.5%). The covered lymph node volume was 69.8% +/- 35.5% (69.1% +/- 36.3%) for primary breast cancer and 57.6% +/- 38.9% (51.1% +/- 39.1%) for recurrent breast cancer using the RTOG (ESTRO) guidelines. The internal mammary region and supraclavicular region were affected more often in recurrent breast cancer compared with primary breast cancer. The occurrence of lymph node metastases outside the RTOG and ESTRO margins in patients with and without distant metastases was similar. The largest geometric deviations between RTOG/ESTRO CTV contours and lymph node occurrence were measured in the supraclavicular region, the internal mammary region, and level II.Conclusions: The provided lymph node atlas illustrates where lymph node metastases occur in different clinical situations and presents areas at high risk (ie " hot spots" of lymph node metastases).

TI  - Dynamics of Vegetation Restoration in the Steppe Zone of the Khakassia Republic Based on Surface and Satellite Data
T2  - Biofizika
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics and peculiarities of the restoration of motley grass-wormwood and wormwood-gramineous phytocoenoses on fallow lands in the Altai region, the Republic of Khakassia, were determined based on surface and satellite data. The species composition, structure and phytomass of phytocoenoses were also revealed. The gradual formation of structural elements of steppe communities on the investigated deposits was established. In this work it has been shown expedient to use time series of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) satellite data for the study of the features of the recovery of fallows. Biological features, projective coverage, phytomass generally determine the magnitude of NDVI. Interannual variability of NDVI reflects the degree and time of restoration of deposits. From a certain point, there is an increase in parameters close to the steppe (control option). It is established that not only abiotic factors (climate, soils), but also biotic factors (grazing, recreational load) affect the NDVI values. In this regard, the length of the restoration process is not always consistent with what is given in literature. Different conditions require a different process. Processing of climate data from "Abakan" weather station (index 29862 in the network of the World Meteorological Organization) was performed using statistical methods of analysis during the 2000-2017 time period. The "average multi-year rates" of temperatures and precipitation amounts (year, month) of the World Meteorological Organization base period of 1961-1990 were calculated. The analysis of the dynamics of the temperature and precipitation values over long-term series is carried out.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) has evolved from a guideline by using the best approach to integrated care pathways using mobile technology in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma multimorbidity. The proposed next phase of ARIA is change management, with the aim of providing an active and healthy life to patients with rhinitis and to those with asthma multimorbidity across the lifecycle irrespective of their sex or socioeconomic status to reduce health and social inequities incurred by the disease. ARIA has followed the 8-step model of Kotter to assess and implement the effect of rhinitis on asthma multimorbidity and to propose multimorbid guidelines. A second change management strategy is proposed by ARIA Phase 4 to increase self-medication and shared decision making in rhinitis and asthma multimorbidity. An innovation of ARIA has been the development and validation of information technology evidence-based tools (Mobile Airways Sentinel Network [MASK]) that can inform patient decisions on the basis of a self-care plan proposed by the health care professional.

TI  - Micro-topographic roughness analysis (MTRA) highlights minimally eroded terrain in a landscape severely impacted by historic agriculture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The 190 km(2) Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory in the Piedmont region of South Carolina, USA lies in an ancient, highly weathered landscape transformed by historic agricultural erosion. Following the conversion of largely hardwood forests to cultivated fields and pastures for similar to 200 years, excess runoff from fields led to extreme sheet, rill, and gully erosion across the landscape. Roads, terraces, and a variety of other human disturbances have increased the landscapes surface roughness. By the 1950s, cultivation-based agriculture was largely abandoned across most of the Southern Piedmont due to soil erosion, declining agricultural productivity, and shifting agricultural markets. Secondary forests, dominated by loblolly and shortleaf pines, have since regrown on much of the landscape, including the 1500 km(2) Sumter National Forest, which was purchased from farmers and private land owners in the 1930s. Although this landscape was intensively farmed for approximately 150 years, there are a few hardwood forest stands and even entire small watersheds that have never been plowed and degraded by farming. Such relatively old hardwood stands and watersheds comprise relic landforms whose soils, regoliths, and vegetation are of interest to hydrologists, environmental historians, biogeochemists, geomorphologists, geologists, pedologists, and others interested in understanding the legacy of land-use history in this severely altered environment.In this work we champion the need for high-resolution terrain mapping and demonstrate how Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation model (DEM) data and microtopographic terrain roughness analyses (MTRA) can be used to infer land use history and management. This is accomplished by analyzing fine scale variation in terrain slope across the 1190 km(2) CCZO using data derived from three independent and overlapping LiDAR datasets at varying spatial resolutions. Terrain slope variability MTRA is further compared to three other methods of capturing and quantifying fine-scale surface roughness. We lastly demonstrate how these analyses can be employed in concert with historic aerial photography from the 1930's, contemporary Landsat remote sensing data, and ecological field data to identify reference relic landforms: hardwood stands, hillslopes, and small watersheds that have experienced minimal anthropogenic erosion for study and conservation.

TI  - 3D hyperspectral point cloud generation: Fusing airborne laser scanning and hyperspectral imaging sensors for improved object-based information extraction
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing technologies allow to map biophysical, biochemical, and earth surface parameters of the land surface. Of especial interest for various applications in environmental and urban sciences is the combination of spectral and 3D elevation information. However, those two data streams are provided separately by different instruments, namely airborne laser scanner (ALS) for elevation and a hyperspectral imager (HSI) for high spectral resolution data. The fusion of ALS and HSI data can thus lead to a single data entity consistently featuring rich structural and spectral information. In this study, we present the application of fusing the first pulse return information from ALS data at a sub-decimeter spatial resolution with the lower-spatial resolution hyperspectral information available from the HSI into a hyperspectral point cloud (HSPC). During the processing, a plausible hyperspectral spectrum is assigned to every first-return ALS point. We show that the complementary implementation of spectral and 3D information at the point-cloud scale improves object-based classification and information extraction schemes. This improvements have great potential for numerous land cover mapping and environmental applications.

TI  - Is there a role for a handheld gamma camera (TReCam) in the SNOLL breast cancer procedure?
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel node and occult lesion localization (SNOLL) calls for a combination of two specific procedures: intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN) and radio-guided occult lesion localization (ROLL). The safety and benefits of radio-guided localization in the surgical treatment of non-palpable breast cancer have been confirmed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential role for an intra-operative handheld tumor resection gamma camera (TReCam) in SNOLL procedures.METHODS: Fifteen patients were enrolled. The SNOLL procedure was performed in all patients with conventional lymphoscintigraphy (LS). TReCam was used to obtain nuclear imaging in the operating theater. Concordance between LS and TReCam images, duration of use and assessment of difficulties in data acquisition with TReCam were reported.RESULTS: Concordance for tumor localization between single-detector gamma probe and TReCam was excellent (15/15). The number of radioactive SLNs visualized between LS and TReCam was equivalent in 53.3% of cases (8/15). TReCam was considered to be very easy-to-use (12/15) or easy-to-use (3/15). Average duration of acquisition with TReCam was 4 minutes and 45 seconds for the SLN procedure, and 2 minutes and 10 seconds for lumpectomy.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that TReCam is easy-to-use and does not increase operative time. Its exact role in radio-guided surgery needs to be clearly defined in a larger study. However, its usefulness and benefits in radio-guided breast surgery seem to be promising.

TI  - Visualizing Efficacy of Pesticides Against Disease Vector Mosquitoes in the Field
T2  - JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficacy of public health pesticides targeting nuisance and disease-vector insects such as mosquitoes, sand flies, and filth-breeding flies is not uniform across ecological zones. To best protect public and veterinary health from these insects, the environmental limitations of pesticides need to be investigated to inform effective use of the most appropriate pesticide formulations and techniques. We have developed a research program to evaluate combinations of pesticides, pesticide application equipment, and application techniques in hot-arid desert, hot-humid tropical, warm and cool temperate, and urban locations to derive pesticide use guidelines specific to target insect and environment. To these ends we designed a system of protocols to support efficient, cost-effective, portable, and standardized evaluation of a diverse range of pesticides and equipment across multiple environments. At the core of these protocols is the use of an array of small cages with colony-reared sentinel mosquitoes (adults and immatures) and sand flies (adults), strategically arranged in natural habitats and exposed to pesticide spray. Spatial and temporal patterns of pesticide efficacy are derived from percent mortality in sentinel cages, then mapped and visualized in a geographic information system. Maps of sentinel mortality data may be statistically compared to evaluate relative efficacy of a pesticide across multiple environments, or to study multiple pesticides in a single environment. Protocols may be modified to accommodate a variety of scenarios, including, for example, the vertical orientation of sentinels in canopy habitats or simultaneous testing of ground and aerial application methods.

TI  - A remote sensing look at the economy of a Russian region (Rostov) adjacent to the Ukrainian crisis
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data used in combination with a stochastic production function method reveal an inefficient formal economy in rural Rostov Oblast 2013-2015 embedded in an overall (formal and informal) relatively efficient economy with the measurement of both important to better understand non-economic impacts of sanctions. Increased military activity may have insulated the formal economy of the border area from poor economic performance and the deindustrialization that characterizes adjacent areas. The current Oblast Administration's grant program to localities does not reward relatively efficient economic performance with a model suggested here to change the policy. The region's economy has the ability to absorb many Ukrainian refugees though non-economic issues support the current assistance from other Russian regions in helping relocate refugees beyond Rostov region. Like other conflict zones, urban areas experience less of an impact relative to rural areas. (C) 2019 The Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Subsurface Sediment Mobilization in the Southern Chryse Planitia on Mars
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern part of the smooth plain of Chryse Planitia on Mars hosts a large population of kilometer-sized (from similar to 0.2 to similar to 20km) landforms spread over a wide area. Based on the investigation of a small part of this area, Komatsu et al. (2016, ) proposed that the edifices may be the result of the subsurface sediment mobilization. We mapped the full extent of these landforms within Chryse Planitia and performed a morphological and spatial analysis in an attempt to further test this hypothesis. We identified a total number of 1,318 of these objects, which we grouped into five different morphological classes. The edifices can be observed over an area of 700,000km(2) near the termini of the large outflow channels, Ares, Simud, and Tiu Valles, with a nonrandom spatial distribution. The features are clustered and anticorrelated to the ancient highlands, which form erosional remnants shaped by the outflow events. This suggests a genetic link between the distribution of the edifices and the presence of the sedimentary deposits on which they are superposed. Such distribution is consistent with the previous notion that subsurface sediment mobilization may be the mechanism for their formation and is less consistent with the alternative igneous volcanic hypothesis. We also propose a scenario in which the large morphologic variability can be explained by variations of the water content within the ascending mud and by variations in the effusion rates. The edifices may represent one of the most prominent fields of sedimentary volcanism detected on Mars.Plain language summary Ever since the presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere was reported from ground-based, orbital, and in situ observations, mud volcanism was hypothesized to be a possible release mechanism, and various mud volcano fields have been tentatively identified. Although morphological similarities with Earth sedimentary volcanism have been proposed (e.g., Skinner & Mazzini, 2009, ), it is difficult, however, to prove unambiguously the presence of mud volcanism in remote sensing data, and some of the reported mud volcanoes have alternatively been interpreted as igneous volcanoes. A definitive identification of sedimentary volcanoes on Mars is therefore still problematic. A useful candidate area to test the hypothesis of sedimentary volcanism on Mars is a field of kilometer-sized cone- and pie-like landforms in the southern part of the large ancient Chryse impact basin, part of which was previously studied by Komatsu et al. (2016, ). In this study, we searched for those landforms inside Chryse Planitia and determined their full spatial extent. We found that they can be divided into five morphologically different groups and that they occur exclusively on the level sedimentary plains. These findings enable us providing additional evidence to support the hypothesis of subsurface sediment mobilization as a possible mechanism for their formation.

TI  - A monitoring toolkit for banksia woodlands: comparison of different scale methods to measure recovery of vegetation after fire
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we compare the efficiency and accuracy of remote sensing and plot-based methods for measuring vegetation cover for the understory and canopy of banksia woodland in an urban area of Western Australia. Methods compared were visual estimation, foliage cover computation from photographs, satellite imagery and aerial photographs. Observations and images from 1 m(2), 100 m(2) and 625 m(2) quadrats measured cover of small plants, understory plants and trees respectively. Aerial photography and satellite imagery allowed the number, height and cover of trees to be estimated in 625 m(2) and 1 ha plots. The accuracy of methods was compared using a 28 month time series commencing before and after an intense bushfire that removed all foliage cover. Directly comparable methods were in close agreement and in combination allowed plant recovery to be quantified in great detail. Visual estimation of cover in the field was time-consuming but necessary to measure the contribution of individual species. Visual estimates from 1 m(2) downward photos allowed functional groups of plants to be measured. The number of green pixels selected manually in photographs confirmed that cover calculated from ground-based photographs using algorithms was accurate, except when cover was very low. We developed a new algorithm for computing cover from photographs that was accurate at low cover (Gperc). Canopy cover estimation by algorithm from upward photographs was subject to more errors, requiring exclusion of some images. Landsat satellite images allowed the impacts of severe drought and previous fires to be identified against a background of relatively consistent seasonal variations since 1988. Aerial photographs from 1953 onwards showed gradual recolonisation by banksia woodland trees over 60 years following tree felling. These methods provide a toolkit for monitoring vegetation recovery after disturbance and baseline data for monitoring banksia woodland. This toolkit should also be suitable for most other plant communities.

TI  - Patch-scale biodiversity retention in fragmented landscapes: Reconciling the habitat amount hypothesis with the island biogeography theory
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim To test whether the species richness of understorey insectivorous birds on forest islands induced by a major hydroelectric dam is best explained by either the island biogeography theory (IBT) or the habitat amount hypothesis (HAH). Given the low dispersal ability of the focal species group and the hostile water matrix, we predict that the species richness will be predominantly driven by an island effect as posited by the IBT, rather than a sample area effect as posited by the HAH. Location Forest islands within the Balbina Hydroelectric Reservoir, central Brazilian Amazonia. Taxon Birds. Methods We mist-netted birds at 33 forest islands (0.63-1,699 ha), totalling 874 individuals of 59 species. The size of the local landscape used to calculate the habitat amount was determined by a multi-scale analysis in which buffers around mist-net lines ranged from 50 to 2,000 m. We applied four tests to examine whether the species richness on forest islands is predominantly driven by either an island effect (island size) or a sample area effect (habitat amount). Results From the four tests applied, one was consistent with an island effect, two were regarded as inappropriate to test the HAH, and one could not be adequately addressed due to island size being highly correlated with habitat amount in the local landscape (200-m buffer). Main conclusions Some of the proposed ways of testing the HAH may lead to misleading conclusions. The relative importance of island size in determining the species richness of understorey insectivorous birds on forest islands is higher than that of surrounding habitat amount, thereby providing stronger support for IBT. We propose a conceptual framework, based on the degree of matrix permeability and species dispersal ability, to determine to what extent a patch- or landscape-centric worldview in landscape ecology provides the most appropriate framework to assess the effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity.

TI  - Object-Based Change Detection in the Cerrado Biome Using Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection methods are often incapable of accurately detecting changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal variations. Techniques for de-seasoning time series or methods that apply the spatial context have been used to improve the results of change detection. However, few studies have explored Landsat's shortwave infrared channel (SWIR 2) to discriminate between seasonal changes and land use/land cover changes (LULCC). Here, we explored the effectiveness of Operational Land Imager (OLI) spectral bands and vegetation indices for detecting deforestation in highly seasonal areas of Brazilian savannas. We adopted object-based image analysis (OBIA), applying a multidate segmentation to an OLI time series to generate input data for discrimination of deforestation from seasonal changes using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. We found adequate separability between deforested objects and seasonal changes using SWIR 2. Using spectral indices computed from SWIR 2, the RF algorithm generated a change map with an overall accuracy of 88.3%. For deforestation, the producer's accuracy was 88.0% and the user's accuracy was 84.6%. The SWIR 2 channel as well as the mid-infrared burn index presented the highest importance among spectral variables computed by the RF average impurity decrease measure. Our results give support to further change detection studies regarding to suitable spectral channels and provided a useful foundation for savanna change detection using an object-based method applied to Landsat time series.

TI  - Equine syndromic surveillance in Colorado using veterinary laboratory testing order data
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe Risk Identification Unit (RIU) of the US Dept. of Agriculture's Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health (CEAH) conducts weekly surveillance of national livestock health data and routine coordination with agricultural stakeholders. As part of an initiative to increase the number of species, health issues, and data sources monitored, CEAH epidemiologists are building a surveillance system based on weekly syndromic counts of laboratory test orders in consultation with Colorado State University laboratorians and statistical analysts from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Initial efforts focused on 12 years of equine test records from three state labs. Trial syndrome groups were formed based on RIU experience and published literature. Exploratory analysis, stakeholder input, and laboratory workflow details were needed to modify these groups and filter the corresponding data to eliminate alerting bias. Customized statistical detection methods were sought for effective monitoring based on specialized laboratory information characteristics and on the likely presentation and animal health significance of diseases associated with each syndrome.MethodsData transformation and syndrome formation focused on test battery type, test name, sub-mitter source organization, and specimen type. We analyzed time series of weekly counts of tests included in candidate syndrome groups and conducted an iterative process of data analysis and veterinary consultation for syndrome refinement and record filters. This process produced a rule set in which records were directly classified into syndromes using only test name when possible, and otherwise, the specimen type or related body system was used with test name to determine the syndrome. Test orders associated with government regulatory programs, veterinary teaching hospital testing protocols, or research projects, rather than clinical concerns, were excluded. We constructed a testbed for sets of 1000 statistical trials and applied a stochastic injection process assuming lognormally distributed incubation periods to choose an alerting algorithm with the syndrome-required sensitivity and an alert rate within the specified acceptable range for each resulting syndrome. Alerting performance of the EARS C3 algorithm traditionally used by CEAH was compared to modified C2, CuSUM, and EWMA methods, with and without outlier removal and adjustments for the total weekly number of non-mandatory tests.ResultsThe equine syndrome groups adopted for monitoring were abortion/reproductive, diarrhea/GI, necropsy, neurological, respiratory, systemic fungal, and tickborne. Data scales, seasonality, and variance differed widely among the weekly time series. Removal of mandatory and regulatory tests reduced weekly observed counts significantly-by >80% for diarrhea/GI syndrome. The RIU group studied outcomes associated with each syndrome and called for detection of single-week signals for most syndromes with expected false-alert intervals >8 and <52 weeks, 8-week signals for neurological and tickborne monitoring (requiring enhanced sensitivity), 6-week signals for respiratory, and 4-week signals for systemic fungal. From the test-bed trials, recommended methods, settings and thresholds were derived.ConclusionsUnderstanding of laboratory submission sources, laboratory workflow, and of syndrome-related outcomes are crucial to form syndrome groups for routine monitoring without artifactual alerting. Choices of methods, parameters, and thresholds varied by syndrome and depended strongly on veterinary epidemiologist-specified performance requirements.

TI  - Analysing spatial temporal changes in rice cultivation practices in the Senegal River Valley using MODIS time-series and the PhenoRice algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we used the PhenoRice algorithm to track recent variations of rice cultivation practices along the Senegal River Valley. Time series of MODIS imagery with 250 m spatial resolution and a nominal 8-days frequency were used as input for the algorithm to map the spatial and temporal variations of rice cultivated area and of several important phenological metrics (e.g., crop establishment and harvesting dates, length of season) for the 2003-2016 period in both the dry and the wet rice cultivation seasons. Comparison between PhenoRice results and ancillary and field data available for the Senegal part of the study area showed that the algorithm is able to track the interannual variations of rice cultivated area, despite the total detected rice area being consistently underestimated. PhenoRice estimates of crop establishment and harvesting dates resulted accurate when compared with field observations available for two sub-regions for a period of 10 years, and thus allow assessing interannual variability and tracking changes in agronomic practices. An analysis of interannual trends of rice growing practices based on PhenoRice results highlighted a clear shift of rice cultivation from the wet to the dry season starting approximately from 2008. The shift was found to be particularly evident in the delta part of the SRV. Additionally, a statistically significant trend was revealed starting 2006 towards a longer dry season (r(2) = 0.81; Slope = 1.24 days y(-1)) and a shorter wet season (r(2) = 0.65; Slope = 0.53 days y(-1)). These findings are in agreement with expert knowledge of changes ongoing in the area. In particular the shorter wet season is attributed to shortage of labor and equipment leading to a delay in completion of harvesting operations in the dry season, which led to the adoption of short-duration rice varieties by farmers in the wet season to avoid risk of yield losses due to climatic constraints. Aforementioned results highlight the usefulness of the PhenoRice algorithm for providing insights about recent variations in rice cultivation practices over large areas in developing countries, where high-quality up to date information about changes in agricultural practices are often lacking.

TI  - Applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to Survey Mesocarnivores
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - With the widespread extirpation of top predators over the past two centuries, mesocarnivores play an increasingly important role in structuring terrestrial trophic webs. However, mesocarnivores are difficult to survey at a population level because their widely spaced territories and nocturnal behavior result in low detection probability. Existing field survey techniques such as track plates and motion-sensitive camera traps are time-consuming and expensive, and yet still yield data prone to systematic errors. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently emerged as a new tool for conducting population surveys on a wide variety of wildlife, eclipsing the efficiency and even accuracy of traditional methods. We used a UAV equipped with a thermal imaging camera to conduct nighttime mesocarnivore surveys in the prairie pothole region of southern Manitoba, Canada. This was part of a much larger ecological study evaluating how lethal removal of mesocarnivores affects duck nest success. Here, our objective was to describe methods and equipment that were successful in detecting mesocarnivores. We used a modified point-count survey from six waypoints that surveyed a spatial extent of 29.5 ha. We conducted a total of 200 flights over 53 survey nights during which we detected 32 mesocarnivores of eight different species. Given the large home ranges of mesocarnivores relative to the spatial and temporal scale of our spot sampling approach, results of these types of point-count surveys should be considered estimates of minimum abundance and not a population census. However, more frequent sampling and advanced statistics could be used to formally estimate population occupancy and abundance. UAV-mounted thermal imaging cameras appear to be an effective tool for conducting nocturnal population surveys on mesocarnivores at a moderate spatial scale.

TI  - Uptake of direct acting antiviral therapies for the treatment of hepatitis C virus among people who inject drugs in a universal health-care system
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and Aims Direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatment can reduce hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection incidence and mortality, although large scale uptake of these treatments is necessary to achieve those reductions. Targeting people who inject drugs (PWID) will be crucial to achieve the necessary reductions. Previously, treatment uptake has been very low (1-2%) among PWID, but these new DAAs have been subsidised in Australia since March 2016. This study describes treatment uptake among a sample of PWID in Australia and examines sociodemographic and drug use variables associated with treatment uptake. Design and Methods An Australian national cross-sectional sample (n = 817) of regular PWID drawn from a convenience sentinel sample aged >= 18 years. Information on demographics, drug use, HCV antibody testing, RNA testing, recent DAA treatment initiation and DAA prescriber settings was collected via an interviewer-administered survey. Results There were 291 HCV RNA positive participants, of who one-third reported initiating DAA treatment since the introduction of subsidised DAA medications. Current opioid substitution treatment was significantly associated with increased treatment uptake (adjusted odds ratio 2.20, 95% confidence interval 1.31, 3.68) while those with unstable housing were less likely to initiate treatment (adjusted odds ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.22, 0.82). Discussion and Conclusions This study found that DAA treatment uptake has increased among current PWID, a priority population for treatment. Efforts to maintain this uptake through linking current PWID with treatment providers through harm reduction services such as opioid substitution therapy, needle and syringe programs, and outreach services are required to meet incidence and mortality reduction targets.

TI  - An empirical remote sensing algorithm for retrieving total suspended matter in a large estuarine region
T2  - SCIENTIA MARINA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rio de la Plata is a large, shallow estuary located at approximately 35 degrees S and flowing into the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. it carries a high amount of nutrients and suspended particulate matter, both organic and inorganic, to the adjacent shelf waters and is considered among the most turbid estuarine systems in the world. Knowledge of the concentration and spatial and temporal variability of these materials is critical for any biological study in the Rio de la Plata. In this work, the relationship between suspended particulate matter and turbidity is empirically established in order to derive suspended particulate matter maps from satellite data (MODIS-Aqua) for the Rio de la Plata region. A strong correlation between suspended particulate matter and turbidity was found (Pearson correlation coefficient =0.91) and the linear regression (slope =0.76 and intercepts =12.78, R-2 =0.83) explained 83% of the variance. The validation of the empirical algorithm, using co-located and coincident satellite and in situ measurements, showed good results with a low mean absolute error (14.60%) and a small and positive bias (3.04%), indicating that the estimated suspended particulate matter values tend to slightly overestimate the field values.

TI  - A UAV-Based Sensor System for Measuring Land Surface Albedo: Tested over a Boreal Peatland Ecosystem
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - A multiple sensor payload for a multi-rotor based UAV platform was developed and tested for measuring land surface albedo and spectral measurements at user-defined spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. The system includes a Matrice 600 UAV with an RGB camera and a set of four downward pointing radiation sensors including a pyranometer, quantum sensor, and VIS and NIR spectrometers, measuring surface reflected radiation. A companion ground unit consisting of a second set of identical sensors simultaneously measure downwelling radiation. The reflected and downwelling radiation measured by the four sensors are used for calculating albedo for the total shortwave broadband, visible band and any narrowband at a 1.5 nm spectral resolution within the range of 350-1100 nm. The UAV-derived albedo was compared with those derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite observations. Results show the agreement between total shortwave albedo from UAV pyranometer and Landsat 8 (R-2 = 0.73) and Sentinel-2 (R-2 = 0.68). Further, total shortwave albedo was estimated from spectral measurements and compared with the satellite-derived albedo. This UAV-based sensor system promises to provide high-resolution multi-sensors data acquisition. It also provides maximal flexibility for data collection at low cost with minimal atmosphere influence, minimal site disturbance, flexibility in measurement planning, and ease of access to study sites (e.g., wetlands) in contrast with traditional data collection methods.

TI  - Less Is More: Minimally 080 Invasive and Quality Surgical Management of Gynecologic Cancer
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgery is a cornerstone of gynecologic oncology. Minimally invasive techniques have been adopted rapidly, in lieu of open approaches, in cervical and endometrial cancer staging. In addition, nodal assessment has undergone significant changes with the introduction of SLN biopsies. The movement toward less is more has also been seen with perioperative and postoperative care and the advent of ERAS protocols, which attempt to maintain normal physiology with the goal of improving functional recovery. It is imperative that new technology be critically evaluated to ensure that oncologic outcomes are not compromised.

TI  - Spatial modeling of litter and soil carbon stocks on forest land n the conterminous United States
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems contribute substantially to carbon (C) storage. The dynamics of litter decomposition, translocation and stabilization into soil layers are essential processes in the functioning of forest ecosystems, as these processes control the cycling of soil organic matter and the accumulation and release of C to the atmosphere. Therefore, the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks are important in greenhouse gas estimation and reporting and inform land management decisions, policy, and climate change mitigation strategies. Here we explored the effects of spatial aggregation of climatic, biotic, topographic and soil variables on national estimates of litter and soil C stocks and characterized the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks in the conterminous United States (CONUS). litter and soil variables were measured on permanent sample plots (n = 3303) from the National Forest Inventory (NEI) within the United States from 2000 to 2011. These data were used with vegetation phonology data estimated from LANDSAT imagery (30 m) and raster data describing environmental variables for the entire CONUS to predict litter and soil C stocks. The total estimated litter C stock was 2.07 +/- 0.97 Pg with an average density of 10.45 +/- 2.38 Mg ha(-1), and the soil C stock at 0-20 an depth was 14.68 +/- 3.50 Pg with an average density of 62.68 +/- 8.98 Mg ha(-1). This study extends NFI data from points to pixels providing spatially explicit and continuous predictions of litter and soil C stocks on forest land in the CONUS. The approaches described illustrate the utility of harmonizing field measurements with remotely sensed data to facilitate modeling and prediction across spatial scales in support of inventory, monitoring, and reporting activities, particularly in countries with ready access to remotely sensed data but with limited observations of litter and soil variables.

TI  - Breast cancer subtypes affect the nodal response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer: Are we ready to endorse axillary conservation?
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the impact of breast cancer subtypes on pathologic complete response (pCR) in 181 patients with positive nodes undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). After NAC, patients underwent surgery, with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary dissection (ALND). In 28.2% of cases a pCR was achieved, with the highest rate in Her2+ and triple negative tumors. Overall, nodal pCR was more frequent than breast pCR (P = 0.003) with higher percentages in Her2+ and LLB-Her2+ (P < 0.05). In the Her2+ group, nodal pCR was observed only with breast pCR. Thus, in Her2+ tumors, breast pCR predicts node pCR, supporting the use of SLNB in this subgroup to stage the axilla avoiding ALND.

TI  - The Vertical Structure of Radiative Heating Rates: A Multimodel Evaluation Using A-Train Satellite Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - We assess the vertical distribution of radiative heating rates (RHRs) in climate models using a multimodel experiment and A-Train satellite observations, for the first time. As RHRs rely on the representation of cloud amount and properties, we first compare the modeled vertical distribution of clouds directly against lidar-radar combined cloud observations (i.e., without simulators). On a near-global scale (50 degrees S-50 degrees N), two systematic differences arise: an excess of high-level clouds around 200 hPa in the tropics, and a general lack of mid- and low-level clouds compared to the observations. Then, using RHR profiles calculated with constraints from A-Train and reanalysis data, along with their associated maximum uncertainty estimates, we show that the excess clouds and ice water content in the upper troposphere result in excess infrared heating in the vicinity of and below the clouds as well as a lack of solar heating below the clouds. In the lower troposphere, the smaller cloud amount and the underestimation of cloud-top height is coincident with a shift of the infrared cooling to lower levels, substantially reducing the greenhouse effect, which is slightly compensated by an erroneous excess absorption of solar radiation. Clear-sky RHR differences between the observations and the models mitigate cloudy RHR biases in the low levels while they enhance them in the high levels. Finally, our results indicate that a better agreement between observed and modeled cloud profiles could substantially improve the RHR profiles. However, more work is needed to precisely quantify modeled cloud errors and their subsequent effect on RHRs.

CP  - 1st International Conference of the Arabian-Geosciences-Union (ARABGU)
CL  - Algiers, ALGERIA
AB  - El Ahmar-Boukais area is located in the northern border of the Bechar Paleozoic basin (Southwestern Algeria). The lack of structural studies in this area led us to undertake this study. The combination of field data and remote sensing analysis were used in order to highlight the Hercynian and alpine deformation in this area. For remote sensing, specific treatments (spectral enhancement, band ratios, principal component analysis, and directional filters) were applied to a Landsat 8 OLI (Operation Land Manager) image. Field measurement led us to validate the results. A mapping has value only with a field data collection. The results of the two approaches are similar, indicating a complementarity for better mapping. Four directions of tectonic structures are evidenced: N-S, NE-SW, E-W, and NW-SE; these directions are raked at least two different tectonic phases. The results issued from image processing techniques and field data were used to constrain the structural map where all tectonic structures are represented.

TI  - Gravity Changes Due to Large Earthquakes Detected in GRACE Satellite Data via Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on the seven largest earthquakes for which we can detect unequivocal coseismic signals in the time-variable gravity (TVG) data of the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite mission during the GRACE era of 2002-2017. After reducing the land-hydrological effect according to model Global Land Data Assimilation System, we employ the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to solve for the spatial pattern and time history of the coherent (standing-oscillation) modes, which provide in an objective manner an overall view of the spatiotemporal scenario. The solved EOF mode for an earthquake-induced TVG typically features a spatial pattern (along with polarity) for the coseismic jump, in conjunction with the time series showing the jump (plus possible preseismic and postseismic variability). In all cases the earthquake EOF mode solutions match well with the least squares coseismic jump in both spatial pattern and amplitude and agree generally with previous reports in the literature. We conclude according to the examined cases that the lowest earthquake magnitude threshold that can be detected by GRACE is the Mw 8.3 of the 2013 deep-focus Okhotsk event, which in fact provides a testable case where the TVG we observe versus the seismologically derived source models may reflect different aspects of the source mechanism under different timescales.Plain Language Summary The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite has observed the gravity changes due to largest earthquakes during the satellite's operation era 2002-2017. We experiment with the numerical method of empirical orthogonal function and demonstrate its efficiency in solving not only the coseismic but also postseismic change behavior for seven largest earthquakes, down to the magnitude 8.3 Okhotsk Sea earthquake for which we find different behavior of the deep-focus event from the seismological models.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Zonation Mapping: A Case Study from Darjeeling District, Eastern Himalayas, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides have been one of the most damaging natural hazards in the hilly region, which cause loss of life and infrastructure, and hence, landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) maps are inevitable for the pre-identification of vulnerable slopes and for the future planning and mitigation programmes. In this study, an integrated remote sensing and geographic information system approach is adopted for the generation of LSZ Map for the Darjeeling and Kalimpong district, West Bengal, India. Topographic maps, satellite data, other informative maps and statistics were utilized. For this study, the causative factors which cause instability of slope such as drainage, lineament, slope, rainfall, earthquake, lithology, land use, geomorphology, soil, aspect and relief were considered. For the generation of LSZ map, thematic data layers were evaluated and generated by assigning appropriate numerical values for each factor weight and their corresponding class rating in the GIS environment. Resulting LSZ map outlines the total study area into five different susceptibility classes: very high, high, moderate, low and very low. This study also demonstrates the classification and prediction of landslide-susceptible zones in coalition with GIS output by using particle swarm optimization-support vector machine approach without feature selection and ant colony optimization approach with feature selection along with support vector machine classifier. GIS-based LSZ map was validated by comparing the landslide frequencies in between the susceptible classes. The usefulness of the LSZ map was also validated by the statistical Chi-square test.

T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests played an important role in carbon sequestration during the past two decades. Using a model tree ensemble method (MTE) to regress the seven reflectance bands of EOS-Terra-MODIS satellite data against country level forest biomass carbon density (BCD) of 2001-2005 provided by United Nations's Forest Resource Assessment (FRA), we developed a global map of forest BCD at 1 kmx1 km resolution for both 2001-2005 and 2006-2010. For 2006-2010, the total global forest biomass carbon stock is estimated as 279.6 +/- 7.1 Pg C, and the tropical forest biomass carbon stock is estimated as 174.4 +/- 5.4 Pg C. During the first decade of the 21st century, we estimated an increase of global forest biomass of 0.28 +/- 0.75 Pg C yr(-1). Tropical forest biomass carbon stock slightly decreased (-0.31 +/- 0.60 Pg C yr(-1)); by contrast, temperate and boreal forest biomass increased (0.58 +/- 0.28 Pg C yr(-1)) during the same period. Our estimation of the global forest biomass carbon stock and its changes is subject to uncertainties due to lack of extensive ground measurements in the tropics, spatial heterogeneity in large countries, and different definitions of forest. The continuously monitoring of forest biomass carbon stock with MODIS satellite data will provide useful information for detecting forest changes.

TI  - Study of monthly mean daily diffuse and direct beam radiation estimation with MODIS atmospheric product
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable diffuse and direct beam radiation data are critical for many scientific researches and engineering applications. While knowledge of radiation components is not sufficient due to the cost and maintenance and calibration of the measuring equipments. Exploring novel methods for estimating radiation components have therefore considerable significance. In this paper, twenty satellite-based models for estimating radiation components were developed using MOD08-M3 atmospheric product, and evaluated using measured radiation data at 15 sites across China. The best site-specific models for diffuse and direct beam radiation were proposed, with the average RMSE of 0.642 MJ m(-2) (9.299%), and 0.736 MJ m(-2)(10.69%), respectively. General models for radiation components were also recommended for widespread applications. The study provides a simple but efficient alternative to obtaining solar radiation components data at regional scale using MODIS satellite data. For other places of interest, the coefficients of the proposed models can be calibrated following the guidelines provided in this study with relative ease, making our models appropriate for widespread applications.

TI  - Fitting Chinese cities' population distributions using remote sensing satellite data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing satellite data from 2012 to 2013 are used to fit the Chinese cities' population distributions over the same period in order to verify the population distribution in China from a relatively objective perspective. Most scholars have used nighttime light data and vegetation indexes to fit the population distribution, but the fitting effect has not been satisfactory. In this paper, processed Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime light data, net primary productivity of vegetation (NPP), and average slope data were used to fit the population distribution from the three dimensions of economic growth, ecological environment, and topographic factors, respectively. The fitting effect was significantly improved compared with other studies (R-2 values of 0.9244 and 0.9253 in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Therefore, this method provides a practical and effective way to fit the population distribution for remote cities or areas lacking census data. Furthermore, there is important practical significance for the government to formulate its population policies rationally, optimize the spatial distribution of population, and improve the ecological quality of the city.

TI  - Spatial Scale Consideration for Estimating All-Sky Surface Shortwave Radiation With a Modified 1-D Radiative Transfer Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial scale variability of surface shortwave radiation (SSR) budget is dominated by clouds. Therefore, a prerequisite step for accurate estimation of the instantaneous SSR components under all-sky conditions, especially partly cloudy conditions, is to determine a proper spatial scale. In this study, a modified one-dimensional (1-D) radiative transfer (RT) model is developed to study the effect of cloud cover on SSR field, in which cloud fraction (CF) is introduced to improve the classic 1-D plane-parallel RT equations and a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is performed to quantitatively understand the effect of CF on SSR under both optically thick and optically thin cloudy conditions. An artificial neural network approach is then employed to generate multiple SSR components based on extensive RT simulations using the modified 1-DRT model and the GSA results. The optimal spatial scale is quantitatively determined through eight cloudy scenarios over the Tibetan Plateau, with different amounts and spatial distribution patterns of clouds. The GSA results show that the top three vital parameters for the modified 1-D RT model are solar zenith angle, CF, and land surface albedo. The optimal spatial scale for applying the modified 1-D RT model is about 20 km, which is surprisingly consistent with some theoretically and technically complicated simulation studies. The finding of the current study adds new evidence to the growing body of knowledge about the spatial scale consideration for estimating all-sky instantaneous SSR with 1-D RT theory.

TI  - Improving ocean color data coverage through machine learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl, mg m(-3)) maps derived from satellite ocean color measurements are the only data source which provides synoptic information of phytoplankton abundance on global scale. However, after excluding data collected under non-optimal observing conditions such as strong sun glint, clouds, thick aerosols, straylight, and large viewing angles, only similar to 5% of MODIS ocean measurements lead to valid Chl retrievals, regardless of the fact that about 25-30% of the global ocean is cloud free. A recently developed ocean color index (CI) is effective in deriving relative ocean color patterns under most non-optimal observing conditions to improve coverage, but these patterns cannot be interpreted as Chl. In this study, we combine the advantage of the high-quality, low-coverage Chl and lower-quality, higher-coverage CI to improve spatial and temporal coverage of Chl through machine learning, specifically via a random forest based regression ensemble (RFRE) approach. For every MODIS scene, the machine learning requires CI, Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc (lambda = 469, 555, 645 nm), dimensionless), and high-quality low-coverage Chl from the common pixels where they all have valid data to develop an RFRE-based model to convert CI and R-rc (lambda) to Chl. The model is then applied to all valid CI pixels of the same scene to derive Chl. This process is repeated for each scene, and the model parameterization is optimized for each scene independently. The approach has been tested for the Yellow Sea and East China Sea (YSECS) where non-optima) observing conditions frequently occur. Validations using extensive field measurements and image-based statistics for 2017 show very promising results, where coverage in the new Chl maps is increased by similar to 3.5 times without noticeable degradation in quality as compared with the original Chl data products. The improvement in Chl coverage without compromising data quality is not only critical in revealing otherwise unknown bloom patterns, but also important in reducing uncertainties in time series analysis. Tests of the RFRE approach for several other regions such as the East Caribbean, Arabian Sea, and Gulf of Mexico suggest its general applicability in improving Chl coverage of other regions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Image culture is a humanitarian concept that is in the stage of its conceptualization, integrated in the thesauruses of such sciences as philosophy, pedagogy, psychology, ethics, aesthetics, sociology, economics and, finally, culturology.At present, taking into account the "explosive" processes of the digital age, globalization, the multiple complication of the axiological picture of the world, etc., the practical and theoretical necessity of scientific analytics, technological elaboration, methodological generalization, verification of the phenomenon of image culture (passed, in the author's opinion, the framework of professional culture and acquired features of universality and scale), as well as the conceptualization of a similar concept has arisen. Irresponsible, massive exploitation of Western scientific schools, theories and technologies without proper adaptation to the Russian mentality, to Russian activities in general, have led to the fact that currently the concept "image culture" is far from ideal, and the very concept of "image" needs rehabilitation.The author defines the image culture as a formatting direction of social culture that reflects the multifaceted socio-psychological characteristics of the individual and society (in different scales: micro-, meso- and macro-, local, regional, national, subregional, etc.), integrates specific structural components (the person himself and / or society as a subject and object of image culture, specific activities for its formation, objectification and disobjectification, as well as the substantive results of this activity: the image, image, status, prestige, etc.) possesses a multilevel set of qualities: axiological, social, professional, political, worldview, etc., related to the ability to live in a multicultural society, dialogic interaction, being sense of purpose, constructive communication and self-improvement.The article gives a cultural analysis of image culture as a conceptualization and sense-filling of a personality and / or social group aimed at development and self-development, projecting the future, building individual and collective meaningful orientations.The image culture is conceptualized by the author through a systems and structural-functional approach through gender-species relations with social, professional, economic and marketing cultures, and also as an independent system whose structural elements are different-sized sets of notions like "image", "appearance", "brand", "status", "prestige", "authority", etc. The article gives a detailed correlation analysis on these structural elements of "image culture", as well as the specific characteristics of its functions.

TI  - Using Taskable Remote Sensing in a Sensor Web for Thailand Flood Monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-based assets have been integrated into a sensor web to monitor flooding in Thailand. In this approach, the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer data from the Terra and Aqua satellites are used to perform broad-scale monitoring for flood tracking at the regional level (250 m/pixel) to generate flood detections/alerts. Based on these alerts, the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) mission is autonomously tasked to acquire higher-resolution (10-30 m/pixel) advanced land imager data, and a number of other assets have imagery automatically requested, with yet further assets requested only in a semiautomated fashion. Based on these alerts, these data are then automatically processed to derive products such as surface water extent and volumetric water estimates in shapefile formats to enable interpretation in geographic information systems. These products are then automatically pushed to organizations in Thailand for use in damage estimation, relief efforts, and damage mitigation. To date, Terra, Aqua, EO-1, Landsat, Ikonos, WorldView-1, WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, and Radarsat-2 have been used in some fashion in the sensor web. The overall autonomous detection, tasking, data acquisition, and processing sensor web framework are described, as well as ongoing work to extend to in situ sensor networks. How the automatic triggering of targeted higher-resolution observations enables higher temporal and spatial resolution tracking of flooding events is also documented.

AB  - Background. During the first half of 2014, a severe outbreak of measles occurred in northern Vietnam, causing 15 033 confirmed cases and 146 deaths.Methods. To evaluate the population-level seroprevalence of protection against measles in the period before the outbreak, we made use of an existing age-stratified serum bank, collected over the year before the outbreak, between November 2012 and December 2013, from 4 sites across the country (Hanoi, Hue, Dak Lak, and Ho Chi Minh City). Data from the UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Clustered Surveys (MICS), carried out in Vietnam during the first quarter of 2014, were used to assess the vaccine coverage in 6 ecological regions of Vietnam.Results. Results revealed a large discrepancy between levels of protection, as estimated from the serology and vaccine coverage estimated by UNICEF's MICS. Variation in seroprevalence across locations and age groups corresponded with reported numbers of measles cases, most of which were among the 0-2-year-old age group and in the northern part of the country.Conclusions. Our study presents a strong case in favor of a serosurveillance sentinel network that could be used to proactively tune vaccination policies and other public health interventions.

TI  - On the estimation of temporal changes of snow water equivalent by spaceborne SAR interferometry: a new application for the Sentinel-1 mission
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work we present a methodology for the mapping of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) temporal variations based on the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry technique and Sentinel-1 data. The shift in the interferometric phase caused by the refraction of the microwave signal penetrating the snow layer is isolated and exploited to generate maps of temporal variation of SWE from coherent SAR interferograms. The main advantage of the proposed methodology with respect to those based on the inversion of microwave SAR backscattering models is its simplicity and the reduced number of required in-situ SWE measurements. The maps, updated up to every 6 days, can attain a spatial resolution up to 20 m with sub-centimetre ASWE measurement accuracy in any weather and sun illumination condition. We present results obtained using the proposed methodology over a study area in Finland. These results are compared with in-situ measurements of ASWE, showing a reasonable match with a mean accuracy of about 6 mm.

TI  - Lemons to Lemonade: Effects of a Biobehavioral Intervention for Cancer Patients on Later Life Changes
T2  - HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The sustainment of gains for cancer patients provided psychosocial interventions is unclear. Furthermore, it is unknown whether interventions also yield long-term positive changes. The present study experimentally tests if an intervention delivered at cancer diagnosis could yield broad, long-term, changes in domains such as relationships, worldview, priorities, and goals. It was hypothesized that the intervention group would report more positive and fewer negative life changes during survivorship versus the control group. Method: Patients with Stage II/III breast cancer were randomized to biobehavioral intervention (BBI) or assessment only. At randomization, patients completed measures of cancer stress (Impact of Events Scale [IES]) and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale [CES-D]). At the 24-month follow-up, survivors (N = 160) completed a thought listing task with 7 prompts (e.g., "relationships"). Patients listed thoughts about change since diagnosis and rated each for valence. Groups were compared on the frequency of positive/negative thoughts across prompts. Listed thoughts were content analyzed. Results: BBI survivors reported significantly more positive changes (p < .05), controlling for IES and CES-D. Groups did not differ on negative changes. Patients with higher IES/CES-D scores reported more negative changes at 24 months (ps < .05). Content analysis revealed a predominance (13/23) of positive thought categories. Conclusions: Adding support for efficacy, BBI survivors reported significantly more positive life changes since diagnosis than survivors not receiving BBI. More generally, heightened stress/depressive symptoms at diagnosis foretold survivors' reporting of more negative changes. Thought listing is a strategy to obtain personalized accounts of life changes after breast cancer.

TI  - Spatial variability of coffee plant water consumption based on the SEBAL algorithm
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Awareness of evapotranspiration (ET) and crop coefficient (K-c) is necessary for irrigation management in coffee crops. ET and K-c spatial variabilities are disregarded in traditional methods. Methods based on radiometric measurements have potential to obtain these spatialized variables. The K-c curve and spatial variability of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) were determined using images from Landsat 8 satellite. We used images of young and adult coffee plantations from OLI (Operational Land Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) sensors over a two-year period. Evapotranspiration was estimated using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL). Moreover, the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was estimated through the Penman-Monteith method. We obtained the values for the evapotranspiration fraction (ETf), analogous to K-c according to ET and ETo values. The study was conducted in Buritis, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, in areas cropped with Coffea arabica irrigated by central pivots. A comparative analysis was made using different statistical indices. Average ETa was 2.17 mm d(-1) for young coffee plantations, , and the K-c, mean value was 0.6. For adult coffee plantations, average ETa was 3.95 mm d(-1), and the K-c mean value was 0.85. The ETc and K-c data obtained based on the SEBAL algorithm displayed similar values to studies that used traditional methods. This model has huge potential to estimate ET of different stages of coffee plantation for the region studied.

TI  - Diagnosing and Managing the Malignant Axilla in Breast Cancer
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of ReviewThe management of the malignant axilla remains a controversial topic. Although many issues have been resolved with the results of randomised controlled trials, there are still areas where evidence is lacking. This review will focus on the current diagnostic methods used to detect lymph node (LN) metastases as well as the impact of volume of LN disease on the choice of axillary management. The roles of surgical excision, radiotherapy and systemic therapy as treatment modalities for LN metastases will also be explored with particular emphasis on the use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Lastly, new innovations in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) will be discussed as a potential test for precise and personalised axillary staging.Recent FindingsThe results of the ACOSOG Z011 trial are widely accepted and axillary conservation is now part of mainstream practice in many parts of the World for patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases and clinical T1/ T2 N0 M0 tumours who had breast-conserving surgery alongside adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy and systemic therapy. Determining the volume of metastatic disease in the axilla is important for treatment decisions and de-escalation of axillary surgery after NACT in patients with biopsy proven pretreatment LN metastases may become part of routine practice for selected patients once long-term outcomes are known. Novel methods to identify LN metastases have been developed over the last 10years including the use of injected microbubbles and CEUS to locate and biopsy sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). Technological advances including ultrafast and super-resolution ultrasound have the potential to increase the diagnostic accuracy of axillary CEUS.SummaryThe main drawback to current axillary management is the lack of a reliable objective test to quantify LN metastases. The de-escalation of axillary surgery is timely but without an objective non-invasive imaging test to replace the axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), clinicians are reliant on predictive medicine rather than precision diagnostics to plan individual treatment. New innovations in CEUS have the potential to provide a reproducible non-invasive test, which can be used in the future to investigate LN metastases in patients with breast cancer.

TI  - The clinical effects of l-arginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine: implications for treatment in secondary Raynaud's phenomenon
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is often the sentinel clinical finding in systemic sclerosis and may precede systemic disease by several years. Altered nitric oxide metabolism plays a critical role in both fibrosis and severe secondary RP phenotypes in these patients. Increased flux through inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) drives cutaneous fibrosis. Failure of flux through endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) contributes to increased vasoconstriction and decreased vasorelaxation. The underproduction of nitric oxide by eNOS is in part due to increased levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. The inhibitory effects of increased ADMA levels may be counteracted increasing serum l-arginine, which is often an effective treatment strategy in these patients. As such, l-arginine-based therapies should be considered in managing secondary RP, particularly given their favourable safety and tolerability profile. While there is no established dosing regimen, studies of oral l-arginine in secondary RP suggest that divided dosing may begin at 1-2 g/day and may be titrated up to 10 g/day. Conversely, primary RP is not associated with increased ADMA production which likely accounts for the failure of l-arginine trials to show benefit in primary RP.

TI  - Fling Effects from Near-Source Strong-Motion Records: Insights from the 2016 M<sub>w</sub> 6.5 Norcia, Central Italy, Earthquake
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a semiautomatic processing scheme (extended BASeline Correction [eBASCO]) for recovering the tectonic fling from near-source records. The method, based on a piece-wise linear detrend of the strong-motion (SM) recordings, is applied to reconstruct the ground displacement field of the 30 October 2016 M-w 6.5 earthquake in central Italy. The robustness of the results is checked against geodetic measurements, remote sensing data, ground-motion simulations, and existing empirical models for fling amplitude.The outcomes of eBASCO are analyzed with the goal of testing its capability to preserve long-period content in near-source SM recordings affected by tectonic fling, different from standard processing schemes based on bandpass filtering. Comparison of peak ground displacements, peak ground velocities, and spectral displacements shows that long-period ground motion recorded over and in proximity of the fault can be underestimated by standard processing. Spectral displacement ordinates can diverge up to the 25% for periods longer than 5 s when an appropriate baseline correction is made.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Characteristic of Land Use/Land Cover Changes in the Middle and Lower Reaches of Shule River Basin Based on an Intensity Analysis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation response to climatic factors is a hot topic in global change research. With the Support of ArcGIS and ENVI software, six sets of Landsat remote sensing images of the middle and lower reaches of the Shule River Basin were interpreted. Eight types of land use and land covers were obtained and the spatiotemporal characteristics of the land use/land cover changes (LUCCs) were analyzed using an intensity analysis to provide a basis for decision-making on the sustainable development of the basin. In the past 29 years, the area of cropland, construction land and shrubland had a net increase, while high-coverage grassland (HCG), medium-coverage grassland (MCG), low-coverage grassland (LCG), wetland and non-vegetation land all presented a net decrease. The area of artificial vegetation (cropland) presented an expanding trend and increased by 1105.56 km(2) in total, while the natural vegetation (grassland, shrubland, wetland) showed a shrinking tendency and decreased by 917.69 km(2). The intensity analysis revealed that the rate of LUCC in the period of 2000 similar to 2006 and 2006 similar to 2010 was relatively higher, although the rate of LUCC in other periods was much lower. The change intensities of MCG and HCG were greatest, followed by LCG, shrubland and wetland. Construction land and cropland were in third place, while non-vegetation land was in last place. The pattern of regional LUCC was generally stable except for cropland loss and the gain/loss change of other land-use/land-cover types was always in an active state. For spatial distribution, few changes were observed in the old irrigated area within the oasis. The LUCC was mainly concentrated in the oasis fringe area, natural vegetation cover area and emigrant arrangement regions.

TI  - Hourly Aerosol Assimilation of Himawari-8 AOT Using the Four-Dimensional Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The next-generation geostationary satellite Himawari-8 has a much higher observation frequency of the aerosol field than polar-orbiting satellites. Aerosol analyses with a geostationary satellite can advance our understanding of the rapid spatiotemporal evolution of aerosols, which is especially critical for studies of air pollution and its mechanisms. We present a one-monthlong hourly aerosol analysis using an aerosol data assimilation based on the local ensemble Kalman filter (LETKF), Himawari-8-retrieved hourly aerosol optical thicknesses (AOTs), and a global model named Non-hydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model coupled with an aerosol model named Spectral Radiation Transport Model for Aerosol Species (NICAM-SPRINTARS). To assimilate asynchronous observations and avoid frequent switching between the assimilation and ensemble aerosol forecasts, the LETKF is also extended to the four-dimensional LETKF (4D-LETKF). The hourly aerosol analyses are evaluated with both the assimilated Himawari-8 AOTs and independent Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)- and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET)-retrieved AOTs. All evaluations show that the assimilations positively affect the model performances and produce simulated AOTs that are closer to the observations. The analyses correctly reduce the significantly positive biases and root-mean-square errors of the control experiment, especially over East China and Australia. Our results also show that hourly aerosol analyses with more frequent Himawari-8 observations are superior to those using the polar satellite MODIS observations. The performances among the LETKF and 4D-LETKF experiments are generally not so different, but the computational load of the 4D-LETKF is much lighter than that of the LETKF.

TI  - "Alas my Backsliding hart!" The Religious Worldview and Culture of Continental Soldiers in New England, 1775-1783
T2  - JOURNAL OF PRESBYTERIAN HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay examines the religious beliefs and culture of New England soldiers in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. While New England soldiers were ordinary in many respects, the written record that they left behind is extraordinary. Careful analysis of their journals, letters, and other relevant eyewitness accounts reveals that the soldiers from New England sustained a vibrant religious worldview and culture that, in many ways, distinguished them from the elite ministers and political leaders of the era. Where revolutionary ministers saw cosmic religious significance in the war, soldiers saw a providential God who was looking out for their needs. The common soldier was more interested in explaining everyday occurrences of warfare and less interested in fighting for an abstract sacred cause. Their religious culture was robust: soldiers kept routine religious rituals, maintained good relations with chaplains, and demonstrated a surprising amount of tolerance toward religious others. Knowing this religious perspective of the rank and file broadens our view of how Christianity related to the American Revolution.

TI  - Elective neck dissection in oral squamous cell carcinoma: Past, present and future
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In 1994 a decision analysis, based on the literature and utility ratings for outcome by a panel of experienced head and neck physicians, was presented which showed a threshold probability of occult metastases of 20% to recommend elective treatment of the neck. It was stated that recommendations for the management of the cN0 neck are not immutable and should be reconfigured to determine the optimal management based on different sets of underlying assumptions. Although much has changed and is published in the almost 25 years after its publication, up to date this figure is still mentioned in the context of decisions on treatment of the clinically negative (cN0) neck. Therefore, we critically reviewed the developments in diagnostics and therapy and modeling approaches in the context of decisions on treatment of the cN0 neck. However, the results of studies on treatment of the cN0 neck cannot be translated to other settings due to significant differences in relevant variables such as population, culture, diagnostic work-up, follow-up, costs, institutional preferences and other factors. Moreover, patients may have personal preferences and may weigh oncologic outcomes versus morbidity and quality of life differently. Therefore, instead of trying to establish "the" best strategy for the cN0 neck or "the" optimal cut-off point for elective neck treatment, the approach to optimize the management of the cN0 neck would be to develop and implement models and decision support systems that can serve to optimize choices depending on individual, institutional, population and other relevant variables.

TI  - Participation and Ease of Use in Colorectal Cancer Screening: A Comparison of 2 Fecal Immunochemical Tests
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION:The impact of fecal immunochemical test (FIT)-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening on disease incidence and mortality is affected by participation, which might be influenced by ease of use of the FIT. We compared the participation rates and ease of use of 2 different FITs in a CRC screening program.METHODS:There were two study designs within the Dutch CRC screening program. In a paired cohort study, all invitees received 2 FITs (OC-Sensor, Eiken, Japan, and FOB-Gold, Sentinel, Italy) and were asked to sample both from the same stool. Ease of use of both FITs was evaluated by a questionnaire. In a randomized controlled trial, invitees were randomly allocated to receive one of the 2 FITs to compare participation and analyzability.RESULTS:Of 42,179 invitees in the paired cohort study, 21,078 (50%) completed 2 tests and 20,727 (98%) returned the questionnaire. FOB-Gold was reported significantly easier to use. More participants preferred FOB-Gold (36%) than OC-Sensor (5%), yet most had no preference (59%; P < 0.001). In the randomized trial, 936 of 1,923 invitees (48.7%) returned the FOB-Gold and 940 of 1,923 invitees (48.9%) returned the OC-Sensor, a difference of -0.2% (confidence interval, -3.4% to 3.0%), well within the pre-specified 5% noninferiority margin (P = 0.001). Only one FOB-Gold (0.1%) and 4 OC-Sensors (0.4%) were not analyzable (P = 0.18).CONCLUSIONS:Although FOB-Gold was significantly but marginally considered easier to use than OC-Sensor, the number of analyzable tests and the participation rates in organized CRC screening are not affected when either of the FITs is implemented as a primary screening test.

TI  - Frontogenesis and the Creation of Fine-Scale Vertical Phytoplankton Structure
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale spatial structuring of phytoplankton patches has significant consequences for the marine food web, from altering phytoplankton exposure to surface light and limiting nutrients, to influencing the foraging of zooplankton, modifying carbon export, and impacting patterns of diversity. Hence, it is important to identify these fine-scale features and determine what generates their variability. Here we present evidence of fine-scale, tilted, interleaved layers in salinity and chlorophyll-a fluorescence observed in free-fall Moving Vessel Profiler surveys across a frontal system west of Point Conception, California. The observed covariability of hydrographic and biological properties allows for decomposition of the features into different water histories. Our analyses suggest that recently upwelled coastal water subsequently advected and intermingled with surrounding water masses from farther offshore. Orientations of the fine layers found in the filament are consistent with restratification and downwelling due to an ageostrophic secondary circulation brought on by frontogenesis. Finite size Lyapunov exponents, a Lagrangian diagnostic calculated from remote sensing data, provide positive evidence for frontogenetic convergence occurring upstream of the feature and allow for direct comparisons with in situ data to gauge their general utility in defining dynamical boundaries. These results highlight how frontal systems not only horizontally compress the biological niches represented by formerly disparate water masses but also create vertical structure and patchiness that can rapidly change over submesoscales.Plain Language Summary Like weather in the atmosphere, frontal systems form in the ocean at the boundary of two different bodies of water. Phytoplankton, the organisms at the base of the marine food web, can find themselves brought into fronts by surface currents. When this happens, patches of phytoplankton are stretched along the front. The circulation at these fronts also causes the patches to tilt across the front, leading to stacked layers which we observed from a ship in the waters off California. When this happens, it changes how much light they receive for photosynthesis and how much of a target they are for the zooplankton that eat them. Besides taking up the greenhouse gas CO2, phytoplankton growth ultimately determines how much food is available for commercial fish to eat. Therefore, the layering process we describe shows how frontal currents can impact the functioning of the marine food web.

TI  - Recent developments in penile cancer imaging
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewThis review discusses new findings in penile cancer imaging in relation to the European Association of Urology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.Recent findingsFor imaging in penile cancer patients who are candidates for organ-sparing primary treatment, ultrasound with Doppler seems to be the method of choice in addition to physical examination. The sentinel node biopsy (SNB) procedure is used to detect small nodal metastases in clinically node-negative patients. In recent years, this procedure has been enhanced by 3D imaging using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with computed tomography (CT) to improve preoperative localization and interpretation of sentinel nodes, as well as hybrid fluorescent and radioactive tracers to increase intraoperative localization of sentinel nodes. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) with CT appears to be mainly useful for pelvic and distant staging in clinically node-positive patients. Other modalities with a potential future role in penile cancer are ultrasound with shear wave elastography, FDG-PET with MRI and ultrasmall paramagnetic iron oxide-enhanced MRI.SummaryImaging modalities in penile cancer have advanced throughout the years, assisting in treatment decision-making and during invasive procedures.

TI  - FIELD TRIALS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE BIOGENTS®-SWEETSCENT LURE IN COMBINATION WITH SEVERAL COMMERCIAL MOSQUITO TRAPS AND TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE BIOGENTS-MOSQUITAIRE TRAP WITH AND WITHOUT CARBON DIOXIDE
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of field experiments was conducted in Florida, California, and Louisiana in order to investigate whether adding the Biogents (R) (BG)-Sweetscent lure to several commercially available mosquito traps increases their Aedes albopictus catch rates and to evaluate the BG-Mosquitaire trap with and without CO2. Adding the BG-Sweetscent to the SkeeterVac Bite-Guard SVE6211, MosClean UV LED (ultraviolet light-emitting diode), Flowtron (R) Galaxie PV 75, Dynatrap (R) DT2000XL, Bite Shield Protector, and Black Flag (R) BZ-40 increased their Ae. albopictus catch rates up to 4.2-fold. The catch rates of the BG-Mosquitaire and the BG-Sentinel did not differ significantly for Ae. aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. The BG-Mosquitaire without CO2 and only with BG-Sweetscent caught 1.2 times more Ae. albopictus than the CO2- and Lurex3-baited Mosquito Magnet (R) Patriot and 2.6 times more than the CO2- and Sweetscent-baited SkeeterVac, respectively. The BG-Mosquitaire baited with Sweetscent and CO2 collected 6.8 times more Ae. albopictus than the Mosquito Magnet Patriot and 11.9 times more than the SkeeterVac. We conclude that BG-Sweetscent increases the tiger mosquito catch rates of many commercially available mosquito traps. We proved that the BG-Mosquitaire is as efficient as the well-known BG-Sentinel and that it can outperform mosquito traps that are baited with propane-generated CO2.

T2  - DERMATOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND There are limited published data comparing wide local excision (WLE) with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) for the treatment of melanoma.OBJECTIVE To describe a novel treatment algorithm for the surgical management of head and neck melanoma and compare rates of local recurrence for tumors treated with either MMS using immunohistochemistry or WLE.MATERIALS AND METHODS A 10-year retrospective chart review including all in situ and invasive melanomas of the head and neck treated at one institution from January 2004 to June 2013.RESULTS Among 388 patients with melanoma, MMS was associated with decreased rates of local recurrence (p = .0012). However, patient and tumor characteristics varied significantly, and WLE subgroup was largely composed of higher stage and risk tumors. Subgroup analysis found that patients with in situ or thin invasive tumors (<0.8 mm) treated with MMS had improved local recurrence outcomes (p = .0049), despite more frequent tumor location on high risk anatomic sites (e.g., central face). In addition, MMS was associated with a favorable delay in time to local recurrence among in situ tumors (HR = 31.8; p = .0148).CONCLUSION These findings further support the use of MMS for treatment of melanoma of the head and neck and help to validate our proposed clinical decision tree.

TI  - Rapid Assessment of Ecological Integrity for LTER Wetland Sites by Using UAV Multispectral Mapping
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term ecological research (LTER) sites need a periodic assessment of the state of their ecosystems and services in order to monitor trends and prevent irreversible changes. The ecological integrity (EI) framework opens the door to evaluate any ecosystem in a comparable way, by measuring indicators on ecosystem structure and processes. Such an approach also allows to gauge the sustainability of conservation management actions in the case of protected areas. Remote sensing (RS), provided by satellite, airborne, or drone-borne sensors becomes a very synoptic and valuable tool to quickly map isolated and inaccessible areas such as wetlands. However, few RS practical indicators have been proposed to relate to EI indicators for wetlands. In this work, we suggest several RS wetlands indicators to be used for EI assessment in wetlands and specially to be applied with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We also assess the applicability of multispectral images captured by UAVs over two long-term socio-ecological research (LTSER) wetland sites to provide detailed mapping of inundation levels, water turbidity and depth as well as aquatic plant cover. We followed an empirical approach to find linear relationships between UAVs spectral reflectance and the RS indicators over the Donana LTSER platform in SW Spain. The method assessment was carried out using ground-truth data collected in transects. The resulting empirical models were implemented for Donana marshes and can be applied for the Braila LTSER platform in Romania. The resulting maps are a very valuable input to assess habitat diversity, wetlands dynamics, and ecosystem productivity as frequently as desired by managers or scientists. Finally, we also examined the feasibility to upscale the information obtained from the collected ground-truth data to satellite images from Sentinel-2 MSI using segments from the UAV multispectral orthomosaic. We found a close multispectral relationship between Parrot Sequoia and Sentinel-2 bands which made it possible to extend ground-truth to map inundation in satellite images.

TI  - Plant-derived verbascoside and isoverbascoside regulate Toll-like receptor 2 and 4-driven neutrophils priming and activation
T2  - PHYTOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Neutrophils have a short live in circulation and accelerate greatly local immune responses via increased granulopoiesis and migration at high numbers to infected or inflamed tissue.Hypothesis: Since neutrophils produce a variety of factors with destructive and pro-inflammatory potential the regulation of their homeostasis and functions might be eventually beneficial in inflammation-related pathological conditions. Herein we investigated the effect of natural-derived verbascoside (Verb) and its positional isomer isoverbascoside (IsoVerb) on neutrophil functions.Methods: We used purified murine bone marrow (BM) neutrophils to study cell responsiveness to priming or activation via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4. The expression of CD11b, chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2), the intracellular level of phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in neutrophils were determined by flow cytometry while the release of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 in culture supernatant was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results: We found that Verb appeared less powerful inhibitor of TLR2 and TLR4-mediated apoptosis than IsoVerb. However at concentrations below 16 mu M and in LPS priming conditions Verb was more selective inhibitor of CD11b and CXCR2 expression than IsoVerb. Both compounds showed similar activity on integrin/chemokine receptor expression when neutrophils were stimulated with ZY or were activated with LPS. Verb sustained CXCR2 expression and turnover via regulation of the cell responsiveness to its ligand KC (CXCL1) and via the release of MIP-2 (CXCL2). Both Verb and IsoVerb increased TNF-alpha production and inhibited p38 phosphorylation in TNF-alpha(+) cells. We fail to discriminate sharply between Verb's and IsoVerb's efficacy when studying p38 phosphorylation in LPS stimulated neutrophils. The multi-parametric analysis provides critical insight on the range of on-target effects of Verb and IsoVerb.Conclusion: The strength and selectivity of Verb and IsoVerb depended on the degree of activation and functional state of neutrophils, and both compounds are with potential to affect neutrophil-related pathologies/conditions in heterogenic populations.

TI  - Accessing the soil erosion rate based on RUSLE model for sustainable land use management: a case study of the Kotmale watershed, Sri Lanka
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Water based soil erosion is a serious socio-economic and environmental problem across the world especially in the tropical region. Assessing the soil erosion quantitatively and spatially provides information to prioritize the soil conservation area in sustainable land management view point. Among the other soil erosion approaches, erosion modeling has been playing a significant role and provides an accurate result in a cost-effective manner. In this study, revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) was integrated with remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) to analyse the quantitative and spatial distribution of soil erosion across the entire Kotmale watershed which is located in the western part of the central mountain region in Sri Lanka. In the methodology, the parameters of the RUSLE model were estimated using pixel overlay method in ArcGIS software, both spatial data and remote sensing data facilitated with appropriate calibration. From the analysis, the annual soil erosion ranges from 0 to 472 t ha(-1) year(-1) with the mean and standard deviation 9.8 t ha(-1) year(-1) and 15.7 t ha(-1) year(-1) respectively. The mean erosion rate of the model was correlated with ground based data. After the final model was established, conservation priority area was identified by using hot and cold spot analysis. Here hot spots shows the area with high soil erosion clustering value, while cold spot refers to area with low soil erosion clustering. The soil conservation priority map has been produced and the result shows that approximately 25% represents hot sport. The result would be an aid and sources for soil and water conservation in the Kotmale watershed.

TI  - Merkel cell carcinoma
T2  - HAUTARZT
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma is arare, highly aggressive skin tumor with neuroendocrine features found in older people. The pathogenesis is associated with immunosuppression, chronic UV light exposure and the Merkel cell polyomavirus. Clinically, Merkel cell carcinoma presents as asolitary, cutaneous or subcutaneous, red to bluish node. Due to early lymphogenic metastasis, locoregional metastases are already present in approximately 30% of cases at the time of diagnosis. The frequent local recurrences as well as the regional and distant metastases usually appear within the first 2-3years after the initial diagnosis. The first treatment after diagnosis consists of complete surgical removal of the primary tumor with wide safety margins as well as asentinel lymph node biopsy. Subsequently, adjuvant irradiation of the primary site should be performed. By additional radiotherapy of the regional lymph node stations, the rate of locoregional recurrence can be reduced. For systemic therapy of advanced Merkel cell carcinoma checkpoint inhibitors targeted against the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have proven to be highly and durably effective. In contrast the formerly frequently used chemotherapy shows moderate to good response rates but they are as a rule very short-lived.

TI  - Reflection on the Basic Standpoint of Mou Zong San's Buddhist Interpretation
T2  - UNIVERSITAS-MONTHLY REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of modern Asian Buddhism should be based on the study of Buddhist academia. However, in the field of Chinese philosophy, Buddhism is also a branch of Chinese philosophy, so it is necessary to discuss the study of Buddhism in the field of Chinese philosophy. The most profound study of Buddhism in Chinese philosophy circles is Mr. Mou Zong San. However, he constructed the philosophy system of neo-Confucianism by using the concepts of Kant philosophy and Heidegger philosophy, and at the same time, sacrificed the correct connotation of Buddhist theory. Mou Zong San compared the views of Tiantai sect and Huayan sect, and elevated the content of Tiantai sect, which focuses on practical philosophy, into a theory of completeness. As for the completeness of Buddhist theory, it appeals to the preservation of the world of sentient beings. Therefore, Huayan sect philosophy is only a partial philosophy rather than a perfect one. These viewpoints all violate the basic content of Buddhism. He thought he was talking about the problem of philosophical truth, but the result was to create a new system. However, as a practical philosophy of Buddhist theory and its worldview, it is by no means in the definition of the concept and speculative gallop can be discussed under the right and wrong. This article will mainly take the Buddhist part of two books, "phenomenon and thing in itself" and "the intuition of wisdom and Chinese philosophy" as the content explanation and the argument of opinion.

TI  - Whole Systems Within Whole Systems: The Oregon Health Plan's Expansion of Services for Back and Neck Pain
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The authors employ a Whole Systems framework to explore implementation of new guidelines for back and neck pain in Oregon's Medicaid system. Whole Systems research is useful for understanding the relationship between complementary and integrative health care (CIH) and conventional health care systems in real-world clinical and practice settings. Design: Preliminary results are from an observational study designed to evaluate state-wide implementation of CIH and other non-pharmacological treatments for neck and back pain among Oregon Medicaid patients. This natural experiment, even in early stages, provides insight into the challenges of integrating Whole Systems oriented therapies into Medicaid billing and treatment. Methods: Qualitative data are drawn from: (1) semi-structured interviews with representatives of each of the 16 coordinated care organizations (CCOs) responsible for administering the Oregon's Medicaid insurance through the Oregon Health Plan (OHP); and (2) open-ended survey responses from acupuncturists in all 16 CCO areas. Results: Implementation of the new policy guidelines poses logistical and epistemological challenges. Differences in worldview, inadequate reimbursement, and simple lack of awareness of CIH among medical providers are some of the factors that pose barriers to merging CIH therapies into conventional frameworks. Conclusions: In this article, we explore the potential for a Whole Systems perspective to better explain the complexity of integrating CIH and other non-pharmacological services into a state financed health care system. Oregon's expansion of services for back and neck pain presents an opportunity to explore challenges and successes in melding multiple approaches to health and pain management into a managed system such as the OHP.

TI  - Downscaling MODIS land surface temperature over a heterogeneous area: An investigation of machine learning techniques, feature selection, and impacts of mixed pixels
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed Land Surface Temperature (LST) is of paramount importance in numerous environmental applications. Although, coarse spatial resolution sensors provide frequent LST measurements, their applicability is rather limited for many applications. Downscaling methods are therefore applied to improve the spatial resolution of LST products. A number of Machine Learning (ML) methods have already been used in the LST downscaling studies. Nevertheless, the literature lacks a suitable inter-comparison of different ML methods, as well as the impact of the feature selection process on downscaling results. This study aims at comparing downscaled 1ST from 1 km daily MODIS 1ST product (MOD11A1) to 240 m using Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Temperature Sharpening (TsHARP) approaches with 11 predictor variables at a heterogeneous area in different seasons. In addition, by implementing a feature selection with the Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) method, the most important variables were selected and used as inputs of the models. The results were evaluated against the 1ST derived from Landsat-8 thermal imageries using a split window method, showing that all the ML methods perform well in 1ST downscaling (with an average RMSE = 2.5 and MAE = 1.74) with marginal differences, outperforming the TsHARP method (RMSE similar to 3.02, MAE similar to 2.19). Among all the methods, ELM required the least computational effort, and when it was combined with SVM-RFE, general efficiency of the downscaling procedure was increased substantially.

TI  - Lymph node harvest in breast cancer patients with and without preoperative scintigraphy
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard of care for women with node negative breast cancer. Tc99 nanocolloid is a popular tracer, facilitating preoperative lymphoscintigraphy to identify sentinel nodes. This study compares the number of sentinel lymph nodes identified at the time of surgery in women who had lymphoscintigraphy with those who did not.Method: All women with primary breast cancer undergoing a SLNB from 2003-2017 who were node negative and did not have neoadjuvant chemotherapy were retrospectively reviewed in this study.Results: 576 women who had Tc99 preoperative injection were included in the study. Three hundred patients (Group 1) underwent lymphoscintigraphy preoperatively and 276 (Group 2) had no lymphoscintigraphy. The mean age at diagnosis for Groups 1 and 2 were 56 and 58 years. respectively. Both groups were also found to be similar in terms of histological subtype, tumour location, size, and HER2- and Estrogen receptor (ER) status. The surgery for the breast primal) was similar in groups 1 and 2. While both groups had a median number of 2 nodes identified, the mean number of nodes identified for Group 2 (2.12) was 10% higher than for Group 1 (1.92) (p = 0.0026).Conclusion: This is the largest series to show that a preoperative lymphoscintigram (scan) can safely be omitted when performing a SLNB. As newer tracers are being used (e.g. Iron Oxide). it is important to know that accuracy of SLNB is not compromised by omission of a scan.

TI  - Resource- and content-aware, scalable stitching framework for remote sensing images
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a new approach to solving the scalability problem in stitching and registration of satellite images. The image stitching process is mostly utilized to capture an image of an entire object, whose parts fall in separate but overlapping mosaics. Due to their high resolutions and huge sizes, the stitching of satellite mosaic images is time- and resource-consuming process. The work presented in this paper proposes a resource- and content-aware, scalable stitching technique. The main idea is based on measuring and assessing the available hardware resources of the machine, on which stitching process runs, and scaling the resolution of the images accordingly. Moreover, preprocessing is not needed, and the adjustment is performed dynamically at run time. The effectiveness of the proposed technique was assessed by partially registering overlapping satellite mosaic images of the island of Cyprus and Lake Van. The scalability tests are performed on varying numbers and sizes of the overlapping LandSat-8 satellite images.

TI  - A Correlation between Lightning Flash Frequencies and the Statistical Characteristics of Convective Activity in the Atmosphere
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A modification of the commonly used Price-Rind scheme for lightning flash frequency (LFF), which can be used in calculations with large spatial and time steps, has been developed. If such steps are applied, the exponent in the relationship of LFF as function of convective cloud heights is smaller by a factor of two over land and smaller by one-fourth over the ocean in comparison to the original Price-Rind scheme. The modified version has been implemented in the Climate Model of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences (IAP RAS CM). The results of LFF simulations with the modified scheme agree better with the satellite data than with the original version. In the IAP RAS CM, global warming (cooling) leads to an LFF increase (decrease) in all seasons. The sensitivity of the LFF to surface air temperature changes at the global level is estimated at 10%/K.

TI  - Early Season Parasitism of Cereal Aphids in Wheat Fields and Field Borders
T2  - SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat, Triticum aestivum L., is the most widely grown crop in Oklahoma and typically is planted in early autumn and harvested in June. Wheat often is infested by insect pests, the most important of which are cereal aphids. The objective of the research was to determine the relationship between parasitism rates of cereal aphids on plants in the wheat field border versus in the wheat field. Aphid abundance in borders and fields was assessed by D-vac suction sampling. Three parasitoid species were reared from cereal aphids on sentinel plants in field borders and wheat fields during the 2-year study. Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Cresson) was the most abundant species, followed by Aphelinus nigritus Howard and Diaeretiella rapae (M'Intosh). There was no significant correlation for any species between the number of individuals emerging from aphids on sentinel plants in field borders before wheat was planted to the number emerging from sentinel plants in borders after emergence of wheat plants (r ranged from -0.12 to - 0.22). Nor was there correlation for any species for the number of individuals emerging from sentinel plants in field borders after emergence of wheat to the number emerging at the same time from sentinel plants in adjacent wheat fields (r ranged from -0.08 to -0.07). In a habitat there were significant correlations among species for the number of individuals emerging from sentinel plants (r ranged from -0.08 to 0.94). While the same parasitoid species forage for aphids in field borders as for cereal aphids in wheat fields, parasitism levels in borders did not reflect amounts in adjacent fields. This suggested that the amount of activity of cereal aphid parasitoids at field borders had minimal relationship to the amount of activity and hence to parasitism of cereal aphids in adjacent wheat fields.

TI  - Mapping daily and seasonally evapotranspiration using remote sensing techniques over the Nile delta
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid escalation in water demands for agriculture, domestic, and industry sectors requires skillful management of this limited resource. Globally, the agriculture sector is considered the main user of the water resource. Actual evapotranspiration (ETc) is an important tool in determining the water requirements of different crops. Therefore, precise estimation of the ETc is the major parameter in the water balance of arid and semi-arid agriculture regions such as Egypt. Recently, both Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) become the main techniques that can be efficiently used for estimating the ETc on regional and global coverage. The main goal of this study was to estimate the daily and seasonally ETc over the Nile delta using remote sensing techniques. These techniques were Surface Energy Balance for Land (SEBAL) algorithm with 24 Landsat 8 images. Additionally, FAO-Penman-Monteith method was used to validate the derived ETc from SEBAL algorithm under the same conditions using several performance criteria to assess the performance of the SEBAL algorithm with Landsat 8 in estimating the ETc over the Nile delta. The results revealed that the SEBAL algorithm with Landsat 8 images appears to provide an acceptable estimation of the spatial and temporal distributions of ETc over the Nile delta with acceptable accuracy with R-2 = 97.83%, RMSE about 0.469 mm/day and 15.9% NRMSE. The derived ETc from SEBAL algorithm was then used to estimate the water balance and the irrigation efficiency of the study area. Results of water balance estimates revealed that most of the seasonal ETc (93%) was originally met by surface water and groundwater supplies; however, the remaining portion (7%) was particularly met by precipitation. Furthermore, the estimated irrigation efficiency was about 48.6% in the central portion of the Nile delta. Overall, the performance of the derived ETc from SEBAL algorithm compared to available ground datasets demonstrates the potential of using the SEBAL algorithm with Landsat 8 images for water use and water balance estimates within the Nile delta.

TI  - Land Cover Change in the Abuja City-Region, Nigeria: Integrating GIS and Remotely Sensed Data to Support Land Use Planning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urban expansion is a significant contributor to land cover change and poses a challenge to environmental sustainability, particularly in less developed countries. Insufficient data about urban expansion hinders effective land use planning. Therefore, a high need to collect, process, and disseminate land cover data exists. This study focuses on urban land cover change detection using Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing methods to produce baseline information in support for land use planning. We applied a supervised classification of land cover of LANDSAT data from 1987, 2002, and 2017. We mapped land cover transitions from 1987 to 2017 and computed the net land cover change during this time. Finally, we analyzed the mismatches between the past and current urban land cover and land use plans and quantified the non-urban development area lost to urban/built-up. Our results indicated an increase in urban/built-up and bare land cover types, while vegetation land cover decreased. We observed mismatches between past/current land cover and the existing land use plan. By providing detailed insights into mismatches between the regional land use plan and unregulated urban expansion, this study provides important information for a critical debate on the role and effectiveness of land use planning for environmental sustainability and sustainable urban development, particularly in less developed countries.

TI  - Efficacy and reproducibility of lymphatics mapping technique with sentinel lymph node biopsy in melanoma
T2  - CIRUGIA Y CIRUJANOS
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: The study of the Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) in Melanoma is a procedure that aims the identification of the first node to which the affected cutaneous sector drains in order to avoid unnecessary lymphadenectomies. The present study documents the frequency of identification of SLN; the relationship between positive SLN (PSLN) and recurrence, between the Breslow index (B1) and PSLN, and between B1 and disease recurrence. Method: We analyzed the records of 148 patients with melanoma stages 1 and 11 undergoing lymphatic mapping and GC biopsy from 1999 to 2017 in a third level institution in COrdoba, Argentina. We performed preoperative lympho centellography, lymphatic mapping with combined technique and SLN biopsy. Postoperative controls were established in order to detect recurrences. Results: SLN was identified in 145 patients (97.9%), being positive in 25 cases (17.2%). Recurrence was detected in 10 (8.3%) patients with negative SLN (NSLN), and in 2 (9.09%) with PSLN (p = 0.188). The median B1 was 2 mm in PCG patients and 1.2 mm in GCN patients (p = 0.002). The mean B1 in patients with recurrence was 2.77 mm, and 2.01 mm in those who did not show relapse (p = 0.311). Conclusions: The combined technique allows a high GC identification rate. A greater tendency to recurrence was observed in the presence of CPG. A statistically significant relationship between GCP and 1B was found. The GC technique is effective and replicable in our environment.

TI  - Percutaneous sentinel node removal using a vacuum-assisted needle biopsy in women with breast cancer: a feasibility and acceptability study
T2  - CLINICAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AIMS: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of large-gauge percutaneous removal of the axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) using dual gamma probe and ultrasound guidance.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Technetium nanocolloid was administered the day before surgery. On the day of surgery, potential SLNs were identified with gamma probe and ultrasound scanning. A 7 G vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) device was inserted percutaneously deep to the target node and the node(s) removed. The gamma probe was used to confirm removal of radiolabelled tissue. At surgery, any residual radiolabelled or blue nodes were removed. Morbidity was assessed via (1) a pain questionnaire immediately after the percutaneous procedure, (2) relevant items from the FACT B+4 questionnaire 7-10 days after surgery, and (3) case note review 1 month after surgery.RESULTS: Twenty-two patients consented and 20 patients underwent the procedure. Radiolabelled nodal tissue was obtained in 18/20 (90%). The mean procedure time was 11 minutes. Four of 18 patients had metastatic disease identified in the VAB excision tissue with 100% sensitivity for axillary metastasis. At axillary surgery, additional intact SLN or fragments were found in 14 patients. No additional metastatic disease was found at surgery. One patient suffered a pneumothorax during instillation of local anaesthetic. The median pain score was 10/100 by visual analogue scale. Immediate post-procedure haematoma was common (14 of 20) and prolonged manual compression frequent.CONCLUSION: VAB removal of sentinel nodes using dual scanning is feasible. Although preliminary sensitivity and specificity levels are encouraging, complications may discourage widespread implementation. (C) 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Use of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors during pregnancy among women who delivered live born infants
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 33rd Annual International Conference on Pharmacoepidemiology and Therapeutic Risk Management
CL  - Montreal, CANADA
AB  - PurposeTo describe the use of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFis) among pregnancies ending in a live birth and with a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease (CD), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or ulcerative colitis (UC).MethodsWe identified pregnancies among women aged 15 to 54years between 01/01/2004 and 09/30/2015 from 16 health plans participating in Sentinel. We inferred indication using ICD-9-CM codes in the 183-day period before conception. We assessed proportion of infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab by calendar year, indication, and maternal age, and compared them to proportions in an age-matched, indication-matched, and date-matched non-pregnant cohort.ResultsAmong 19681 pregnancies with at least one chronic inflammatory condition, 2990 (15.2%) received a TNFi. In both pregnancies and matched non-pregnant cohort, TNFi use was highest (34.4%; 55.8%) for PsA patients and lowest (6.2%; 13.4%) for PsO patients. Etanercept was most frequently used among AS/JIA/PsA/PsO/RA patients, while infliximab was the preferred TNFi for CD/UC patients. Except for infliximab and certolizumab, TNFi use during pregnancy decreased after the first trimester. Pregnancies among older pregnant women (45-54years) were more likely to be treated compared with the matched non-pregnant cohort.ConclusionThere was a preference for etanercept among pregnancies with AS/JIA/PsA/PsO/RA, despite the availability of other TNFis. Decline in TNFi use after the first trimester may be related to the desire to reduce TNFis transplacental transfer and to minimize infection risk to the fetus or baby associated with live vaccine immunizations after birth.

TI  - Drivers of forest cover changes in the Choco-Darien Global Ecoregion of South America
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical rain forests are suffering the highest deforestation and reforestation ever recorded. Interactions between direct (proximate or direct causes) and indirect (underling or indirect causes) drivers could duster these forest cover changes forming hotspots (areas that exhibit significant spatial correlation of deforestation or reforestation transitions). Using land use-land cover maps and global (1) and local (I i ) Moran's tests, we identified these hotspots in the Choco-Darien Global Ecoregion (CGE) of South America, a natural region that was declared one of the top 25 hotspots for conservation priorities in the world. Subsequently, we tested and studied the effects and interactions between deforestation and reforestation hotspots and their direct and indirect drivers using Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling (Bayesian SEM). We found that deforestation and reforestation were spatially auto-correlated forming hotspots (I = 0.49, P = 0.001 for deforestation transitions and I = 0.48, P = 0.001 for reforestation transitions). Also, hotspots of deforestation and reforestation were auto-correlated within municipality borders (I = 0.5, P = 0.001 for deforestation transitions; I = 0.49, P = 0.001 for reforestation transitions). Eighteen municipalities located on the border between Colombia and Ecuador showed significant aggregations of deforestation hotspots, while thirty-four municipalities in three areas of Colombia and the area between the Colombian and Ecuadorian border showed significant clustering of reforestation hotspots. Eleven of these municipalities presented significant clustering of both reforestation and deforestation hotspots. The Bayesian SEM for deforestation showed that population growth and road density were indirect drivers of deforestation hotspots (0.191 and 0.127 standard deviation units). The Bayesian SEM for reforestation found that armed conflicts, Gross Domestic Product, and average annual rain were indirect drivers related to reforestation hotspots (0.228, 0.076, and 0.081 standard deviation units, respectively). Our assessment shows a novel methodology to study interactions among direct and indirect drivers of forest change and their potential dissimilar effects on forest transitions.

TI  - Coseismic slip distribution of 2015 Gorkha (Nepal) <i>M</i><sub>w</sub>7.8 earthquake determined using the Helmert variance component estimation
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The source parameters and coseismic slip distribution of the 2015 Gorkha (Nepal) M(w)7.8 earthquake are inverted jointly using an automated fault discretization method based on triangular dislocation models from ALOS-2 satellite interferogram and GPS surface displacement measurements. During the inversion, the Helmert variance component estimation (HVCE) method is used to determine the relative weight ratio among ALOS-2 InSAR, GPS horizontal and vertical component. The maximum slip obtained from the automated fault discretization method with HVCE (HVCE-FR) is 5.5 m, which is larger than the result (5.1 m) from the automated fault discretization method with weight estimated by priori variance of the observations (WPV-FR). The HVCE-FR result shows that the rupture propagates along the southeast direction approaching the M(w)7.3 aftershock of May 12, 2015, and continues to propagate to the north and southeast about 30 km, respectively, which is not resolved in the WPV-FR result. The optimal distributed slip model obtained from the HVCE-FR can well explain the observed InSAR coseismic deformation pattern, with the standard deviation of the fitting residual reduced by 2.5 cm compared with the WPV-FR. The standard deviation of the residuals of GPS east- and north-components are also reduced by 0.4 cm and 0.9 cm, respectively. Compared with the mean value and standard deviation of the slip error determined from two different rectangular dislocation-based methods, the results from the HVCE-FR are relatively small, with a mean value of 0.037 m and a standard deviation of 0.028 m, which indicates that the distributed slip model obtained from the HVCE-FR has relatively better unbiasedness and effectiveness than other methods.

TI  - Concordance Between Intracervical and Fundal Injections for Sentinel Node Mapping in Patients With Endometrial Cancer? A Study Using Intracervical Radiotracer and Fundal Blue Dye Injections
T2  - CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective A major controversy in sentinel node (SN) biopsy of endometrial cancer is the injection site of mapping material. We compared lymphatic drainage pathways of the uterine cervix and uterine body in the same patients by head-to-head comparison of intracervical radiotracer and fundal blue dye injections. Methods All patients with pathologically proven endometrial cancer were included. Each patient received 2 intracervical injections of Tc-99m-phytate. At the time of laparotomy, the uterus was exposed, and each patient was injected with 2 aliquots of patent blue V (2 mL each) in the subserosal fundal midline locations. The anatomical locations of all hot, blue, or hot/blue SNs were recorded. Results Overall, 45 patients entered the study. At least 1 SN could be identified in 75 of 90 hemipelves (83.3% overall detection rate, 82.2% for radiotracer [intracervical] alone, and 81.1% for blue dye [fundal] alone). In 71 hemipelves, SNs were identified with both blue dye (fundal) and radiotracer (intracervical) injections. In 69 of these 71 hemipelves, at least 1 blue/hot SN could be identified (97.18% concordance rate). In 10 patients, para-aortic SNs were identified. All of these nodes were identified by fundal blue dye injection, and only 2 were hot. Conclusions Our study shows that lymphatic drainage to the pelvic area from the uterine corpus matches the lymphatic pathways from the cervix, and both intracervical and fundal injections of SN mapping materials go to the same pelvic SNs.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping by near-infrared fluorescence imaging and contrast-enhanced ultrasound in healthy dogs
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is a valuable and crucial diagnostic procedure in staging malignancies. We compared two non-invasive techniques, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), to identify the SLNs in three superficial anatomical regions in an animal model. Six healthy laboratory dogs were included in a proof-of-concept trial. A NIR fluorescent dye (Indocyanine Green) and microbubbles (Sonovue) were consecutively injected subdermally in the Inguinal, axillary and popliteal region to map the SLNs. Transcutaneous NIR fluorescence imaging identified SLNs in 17 out of a total of 18 occasions. CEUS identified SLNs in all regions (18/18). Whereas NIR fluorescence imaging performed better in the visualization of the afferent lymphatic tract, CEUS demonstrated different filling patterns of the SLNs, a feature potentially critical for the concept of SLN mapping in cancer patients. Both NIR fluorescence imaging and CEUS are safe, non-invasive, practical and accurate methods to perform real-time transcutaneous SLN mapping with potential in a clinical setting.

TI  - Source parameters of the 2017 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.2 Yukon earthquake doublet inferred from coseismic GPS and ALOS-2 deformation measurements
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated an M-w similar to 6.2 earthquake doublet on the border of the USA and Canada using ALOS2 Light-of-Sight displacements and GPS measurements. We selected three L-band ALOS-2 interfergorams with temporal baselines of one yr to extract coseismic deformation maps, in which master and slave images were both acquired in July. A subpixel-based alignment and another range spectral splitting techniques under the GAMMA InSAR software framework were applied to improve the interferometric coherence and reduce the effects of phase anomalies in two of the three interferometric pairs due to either ionospheric delay or a potential focusing issues in the generation of the ALOS2 SLC data. The updated interferograms convincingly reveal deformation fringe patterns produced by the two earthquakes. We conducted a nonlinear geophysical inversion to estimate the geometric parameters of the earthquakes with the InSAR and GPS measurements. The best-fitting model shows that a thrust faulting on a reverse fault and left-lateral strike-slip faulting on a nearly vertical fault with the centroid depths of 9.3 +/- 0.6 and 8.4 +/- 0.7 km, respectively, are most likely responsible for the earthquake doublet. The eastern Denali fault (EDF) and Duke River fault are major active faults in the region and the earthquake doublet could be due to reactivation of the part of the two faults system.

TI  - Impacts of changing spatial scales on CPUE-factor relationships of <i>Ommastrephes bartramii</i> in the northwest Pacific
T2  - FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The selection of spatial scales is of particular importance in modeling relationships between fishery abundance and its influencing factors, because these relationships are significantly affected by spatial scale. Here, we explore the spatial scale effects of catch per unit effort (CPUE)-factor relationships for Ommastrephes bartramii in the northwest Pacific. The original commercial fishery data and oceanographic factors were tessellated to 12 spatial scales from 5 ' to 60 ' with an interval of 5 '. Under the original scale and 12 tessellated scales, we constructed the generalized additive models (GAMs) to model the relationships between the O. bartramii CPUE and the influencing factors, including Year, Month, Latitude (Lat), Longitude (Lon), sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, and sea surface height (SSH). Our multi-scale analysis showed that the relationships are sensitive to spatial scales. Among the factors, Year, Month, and SSS share quadratic polynomial scaling relations; Lat, SST, and Chl-a illustrate power law scaling relations; Lon has a linear scaling relation; and SSH presents an exponential scaling relation. Considering the scale sensitivity of the factor sort-order and the accumulation of explained residual deviance in GAM, we suggest 30 '-45 ' as the optimal range of spatial scales for analyzing the CPUE-factor relationships for O. bartramii. Our research improves understanding of the impacts of changing scales in fisheries and provides a potential method for the selection of a suitable spatial scale for fisheries analysis and resource surveying.

TI  - Exploring the relationship between urban form, land surface temperature and vegetation indices in a subtropical megacity
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the influence of different urban forms in the local microclimate can inform architects and urban planners towards a climate-sensitive design approach. Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter of the microclimate conditions and can be freely and globally accessed through satellite images. This study explores the relationship between daytime and nighttime Aqua/MODIS LST and the urban morphology defined by local climate zones (LCZ) in accordance with the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT) methodology. The vegetation cover from each LCZ was analyzed by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Additionally, the geometric and surface properties of LCZs defined by the literature were tested against measured LSTs to explorer if expected correlations between surface properties and surface temperature could be found. The results show a strong negative correlation between LST and both NDVI and EVI. Generally, the LCZ classes with lower vegetation cover presented higher daytime and nighttime LST. Building surface fraction and impervious surfaces presented a positive correlation with nighttime LST and the pervious surface fraction presented a negative correlation with nighttime LST.

TI  - Tree species classification in tropical forests using visible to shortwave infrared WorldView-3 images and texture analysis
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest conservation and management can significantly benefit from information about the spatial distribution of tree species. Very-high resolution (VHR) spaceborne platforms have been hailed as a promising technology for mapping tree species over broad spatial extents. WorldView-3, the most advanced VHR sensor, provides spectral data in 16 bands covering the visible to near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1040 nm) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR, 1210-2365 nm) wavelength ranges. It also collects images at unprecedented levels of details using a panchromatic band with 0.3-m of spatial resolution. However, the potential of WorldView-3 at its full spectral and spatial resolution for tropical tree species classification remains unknown. In this study, we performed a comprehensive assessment of WorldView-3 images acquired in the dry and wet seasons for tree species discrimination in tropical semi-deciduous forests. Classification experiments were performed using VNIR individually and combined with SWIR channels. To take advantage of the sub-metric resolution of the panchromatic band for classification, we applied an individual tree crown (ITC)-based approach that employed pan sharpened VNIR bands and gray level co-occurrence matrix texture features. We determined whether the combination of images from the two annual seasons improves the classification accuracy. Finally, we investigated which plant traits influenced species detection. The new SWIR sensing capabilities of WorldView-3 increased the average producer's accuracy up to 7.8%, by enabling the detection of non-photosynthetic vegetation within ITCs. The combination of VNIR bands from the two annual seasons did not improve the classification results when compared to the results obtained using images from each season individually. The use of VNIR bands at their original 1.2-m spatial resolution yielded average producer's accuracies of 43.1 +/- 3.1% and 38.8 +/- 3% in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The ITC -based approach improved the accuracy to 70 +/- 8% in the wet and 68.4 +/- 7.4% in the dry season. Texture analysis of the panchromatic band enabled the detection of species-specific differences in crown structure, which improved species detection. The use of texture analysis, pan-sharpening, and ITC delineation is a potential approach to perform tree species classification in tropical forests with WorldView-3 satellite images.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Six global, gridded, gap-free, daily sea surface temperature (SST) analyses covering a period of at least 20 years have been intercompared: ESA SST CCI analysis long-term product v1.0, MyOcean OSTIA reanalysis v1.0, CMC 0.2 degree, AVHRR_ONLY Daily 1/4 degree OISST v2.0, HadISST2.1.0.0 and MGDSST. A seventh SST product of the ensemble median of all six has also been produced using the GMPE (Group for High Resolution SST Multi-Product Ensemble) system. Validation against independent near-surface Argo data, a long timeseries of moored buoy data from the tropics and anomalies to the GMPE median have been used to examine the temporal and spatial homogeneity of the analyses. A comparison of the feature resolution of the analyses has also been undertaken. A summary of relative strengths and weaknesses of the SST datasets is presented, intended to help users to make an informed choice of which analysis is most suitable for their proposed application.

TI  - The extent of surgery for stage III melanoma: how much is appropriate?
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Since the first documented lymph node dissection in 1892, many trials have investigated the potential effect of this surgical procedure on survival in patients with melanoma. Two randomised controlled trials were unable to demonstrate improved survival with completion lymph node dissection versus nodal observation in patients with sentinel node-positive disease, although patients with larger sentinel node metastases (> 1 mm) might benefit more from observation than from dissection, and could potentially be considered for adjuvant systemic therapy instead of complete dissection. Adjuvant immunotherapy with high-dose ipilimumab has led to improvements in overall survival, whereas therapy with nivolumab and pembrolizumab has improved relapse-free survival with greater safety. Furthermore, adjuvant-targeted therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib has improved survival outcomes in BRAF(V600E) and BRAF(V600K)-mutated melanomas. Three neoadjuvant trials have all shown high response rates, including complete responses, after short-term combination therapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab with no recurrences so far, although follow-up is still short. Despite the absence of a survival benefit with completion lymph node dissection in patients with sentinel node-positive or negative disease, the use of sentinel node staging will increase because of the introduction of effective adjuvant therapies. However, routine completion lymph node dissection for sentinel node-positive disease should be reconsidered. Accordingly, existing clinical guidelines are currently being revised. For palpable (macroscopic) nodal disease, the type and extent of surgery could be reduced if the index node can accurately predict the response and if studies show that lymph node dissection can be safely foregone in patients with a complete response. Overall, the appropriate type and extent of surgery for stage III melanoma is changing and becoming more personalised.

TI  - No Trauma, no Problem: Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress in the Absence of a Criterion A Stressor
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has investigated the sentinel role of Criterion A to the diagnosis. Some researchers have found that PTSD symptom measures are elevated in the absence of a Criterion A stressor. Therefore, the current study sought to extend this research to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fifth edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association 2013) using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al. 2013b). Data from 222 veterans presenting to a general outpatient mental health clinic at a Veterans Health Administration were asked to complete the PCL-5 after indicating the presence of a stressful or traumatic life event. In line with previous research, the current study revealed no differences between veterans with (n=92) and without (n=120) a Criterion A stressor on PTSD symptom severity, clinically-indicated levels of PTSD, or symptom clusters. However, these groups differed on empirically-identified core symptoms of PTSD (Brewin et al. Journal of Traumatic Stress 22 (5), 366-373, 2009), such that veterans with a Criterion A stressor reported significantly more core PTSD symptoms. A significant limitation to these findings is that Criterion A status was examined only via self-report on the PCL-5. The findings highlight the need for more research on the definition of a Criterion A stressor, use of the PCL-5, and the current composition of PTSD symptoms that make up the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. In the future, clinicians are encouraged to conduct a thorough trauma assessment in conjunction with a PTSD screening measure to facilitate diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

TI  - Modeling endangered mammal species distributions and forest connectivity across the humid Upper Guinea lowland rainforest of West Africa
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Species distribution data provide critical baseline information for conservation planning and decision making. However, in many of the Earth's most biodiverse regions, such data are lacking for many species. Here, we used ecological niche modeling and connectivity analyses to model distributions of endangered species and protected area connectivity across the Upper Guinea Forest (UGF) Global Conservation Hotspot of West Africa. We estimated the current distributions of African forest elephant Loxodonta cyclotis (Vulnerable), western chimpanzee Pan troglodytes verus (Critically Endangered), and pygmy hippopotamus Choeropsis liberiensis (Endangered) across the region and optimized connectivity in two main forest complexes in the region. We used occurrence data for the period 2010-2016 for the three species from two well-sampled national parks in Liberia (Sapo National Park and Gola National Park), and remotely sensed MODIS enhanced vegetation index data for the period 2010-2015. Our models predicted a total of 75,157km(2) of suitable habitat for chimpanzees in the region, 79,400km(2) for elephants, and 290,696km(2) for hippos. Of these areas, for chimpanzees, 30% of the area predicted falls within the boundaries of proposed or designated protected areas, and likewise 30% for elephants, and 19% for hippos. Liberia had the largest blocks of contiguous forest suitable for these species compared to other countries in the region but this forest was largely unprotected. This study identifies priority areas for biodiversity conservation and forest connectivity in the region, and reemphasizes the practicality of these tools to optimize conservation planning and implementation.

TI  - Willingness to pay for clean air in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We use a residential sorting model incorporating migration disutility to recover the implicit value of clean air in China. The model is estimated using China Population Census Data along with PM2.5 satellite data. Our study provides new evidence on the willingness to pay for air quality improvements in developing countries and is the first application of an equilibrium sorting model to the valuation of non-market amenities in China. We employ two instrumental variables based on coal-fired electricity generation and wind direction to address the endogeneity of local air pollution. Results suggest important differences between the residential sorting model and a conventional hedonic model, highlighting the role of moving costs and the discreteness of the choice set. Our sorting results indicate that the economic value of air quality improvement associated with a one-unit decline in PM2.5 concentration is up to $8.83 billion for all Chinese households in 2005.

TI  - Scaffolding Reality: Acrostics and Identity Construction in Commodian's <i>Instructiones</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF LATE ANTIQUITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the identity work in which Commodian engages through his acrostic Instructiones. In particular, it evaluates the content, rhetoric, and structure of the work to establish that Commodian sought to cultivate in his readers a totalized and uncompromising Christian worldview predicated on a deep-seated humility through which the Christian's individual judgment is always and everywhere suspect, whereas God's is paramount. Commodian argues that Christians must subordinate all other identities to their identities as Christians, and to subordinate their own judgment to the law of God as expressed in scripture. He underscores this argument by offering an acrostic scaffolding for his poetic treatise, one that signals the existence of a higher law and that resonates with contemporary expectations of divine communication and spiritual authority. This article, then, offers a new reading of Commodian's Instructiones, expands our understanding of the possibilities o f Christian identity in third-century North Africa, and presents a novel argument about the possible uses of acrostic in Late Antiquity.

TI  - Persuasion: The Art of Changing Worldviews
T2  - AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Persuaders often face the task of changing their listeners' worldview, which may involve conveying evidence that disconfirms that view. It has been shown, however, that people are often reluctant to change their worldviews. These aspects of persuasion cannot be captured in the standard Bayesian framework. The paper identifies the constraints, opportunities, and trade-offs of persuading people to change worldview. It finds necessary and sufficient conditions under which it is optimal for persuaders to do so. It also shows when and how they conceal disconfirming evidence and take advantage of their listener's existing worldview.

TI  - Estimating mineral content of indigenous browse species using laboratory spectroscopy and sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees provide low-cost organic inputs, with the potential to improve livelihoods for rural communities. Understanding foliar nutrients of tree species is crucial for integration of trees into agroecosystems. The study explored nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) concentrations of nine browse species collected from the bushveld region of South Africa using wet analysis and laboratory spectroscopy in the region 400-2500 nm, along with partial least squares (PIS) regression. We further explore the relationship between canopy reflectance of Sentinel-2 image and foliar N, P, K & Ca. Laboratory spectroscopy was significant for N estimation, while satellite imagery also revealed useful information about the estimation of nitrogen at landscape level. Nitrogen was highly correlated with spectral reflectance (R-2 = 0.72, p < 0.05) for winter and (R-2 = 0.88, p < 0.05) for summer, whilst prediction of phosphorus potassium and calcium were considered not accurate enough to be of practical use. Modelling the relationship using Sentinel-2 data showed lower correlations for nitrogen (R-2 = 0.44, p < 0.05) and the other nutrients when compared to the dried samples. The findings indicate that there is potential to assess and monitor resource quality of indigenous trees using nitrogen as key indicator. This multi-level remote sensing approach has promise for providing rapid plant nutrient analyses at different scales.

TI  - Worldview Matters: Mosetene Ontology and Resource Use in the Pilon Lajas Indigenous Territory and Biosphere Reserve in the Bolivian Amazon
T2  - HUMAN ORGANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses the basic features and transformations of the ontology and related lifeworlds of the Mosetene people in the co-management context of the Pilon Lajas Indigenous Territory and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Our results, based on anthropological fieldwork, showed the Mosetene to be perspectivist, perceiving themselves to be embedded in the forest as part of a web of social relationships linking human and non-human societies. Mosetene are experiencing rapid changes in sociopolitical organization due to increased interaction with actors representing other, dominant ontological communities. The related transformation of the Mosetene worldview is affecting natural resource use. We argue that co-management must address the asymmetries and contradictions related to this encounter of ontologies, in order to reconcile Mostene lifeworlds and biodiversity conservation efforts. Strengthening the position of the elders within the indigenous organization and establishing an inter-ontological dialogue platform among all stakeholders could provide the conditions under which the Mosetene can reenact their communication with the forest's non-human societies while becoming active subjects in the governance of the Indigenous Territory and Biosphere Reserve.

TI  - Dot and Segment Feature Analysis and Parameter Inversion of a Curved and Graded Bay Bridge From UAVSAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When NASA/JPL UAVSAR imaged the curved and graded Coronado Bridge over San Diego Bay, CA, USA, it was shown as three separate features consisting of dots, short curved segments, and a continuously curved segment on the L-band images. Coupled with the images acquired in the opposite look directions toward the bridge, we analyzed the features, attributed the cause for the unidentifiable direct surface backscatter from the bridge roadway, and assessed the azimuth angle effects linked to the features. A two-step procedure was then articulated to resolve the azimuth angle effect on the decomposition of the quad-pol SAR imagery where orientated man-made objects and trees existed. Next, an algorithm using the single polarization data to estimate the curved and graded bridge height and width was developed. With reference to the Lidar-derived heights and the constant bridge width, we evaluated the algorithm using the difference values of 26 samples. L-HH and L-VV results of two UAVSAR datasets were obtained. Of the bridge height or width, the overall mean and one standard deviation values of the differences were <= 3.7 m and <= 2.8 m, respectively. The values were smaller than the azimuth and ground-range resolutions (5 m x 5 m) of the SAR datasets. Thus, the estimated bridge height and width should be acceptable. Finally, we studied the applicability of the algorithm to ALOS/PALSAR datasets of different data acquisition modes.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Daytime Water Leaving Reflectances of Oceans and Large Inland Lakes from EPIC onboard the DSCOVR Spacecraft at Lagrange-1 Point
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) on board the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite has been making multiple observations of the entire sunlit Earth in a given day from the Sun-Earth Largangian L1 point since the summer of 2015. EPIC contains 10 narrow channels in the 317-780 nm solar spectral range. The data acquired with EPIC have already been used in a variety of scientific investigations, including the study of the global ozone levels, aerosol index and aerosol optical depth, UV reflectivity of clouds over land and ocean, cloud height over land and ocean, and vegetation indices. In this article, we report that EPIC data, particularly for the data measured with narrow channels centered near 443, 551, and 680 nm, can also have important applications in remote sensing of ocean color in different geographical regions. We have modified a version of a multi-channel atmospheric correction algorithm for Moderate Resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MODIS) ocean color applications and adapted the algorithm for processing EPIC data. We present three case studies on water leaving reflectance retrievals from EPIC data acquired over a large turbid river, inland lakes, and oceans. We conclude that a future ocean color instrument on board a satellite at the L1 point, which provides continuous view of the full sunlit disk of the Earth, will complement and extend ocean color observations with the low Earth observing polar orbital and geostationary satellite instruments in both the spatial and time domains.

TI  - Rubber Identification Based on Blended High Spatio-Temporal Resolution Optical Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study in Xishuangbanna
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important economic resource, rubber has rapidly grown in Xishuangbanna of Yunnan Province, China, since the 1990s. Tropical rainforests have been replaced by extensive rubber plantations, which has resulted in ecological problems such as the loss of biodiversity and local water shortages. It is vitally important to accurately map the rubber plantations in this region. Although several rubber mapping methods have been proposed, few studies have investigated methods based on optical remote sensing time series data with high spatio-temporal resolution due to the cloudy and foggy weather conditions in this area. This study presented a rubber plantation identification method that used spatio-temporal optical remote sensing data fusion technology to obtain vegetation index data at high spatio-temporal resolution within the optical remote sensing window in Xishuangbanna. The analysis of the proposed method shows that (1) fused optical remote sensing data with high spatio-temporal resolution could map the rubber distribution with high accuracy (overall accuracy of up to 89.51% and kappa of 0.86). (2) Fused indices have high R-2 (R-2 greater than 0.8, where R is the correlation coefficient) with the indices that were derived from the Landsat observed data, which indicates that fusion results are dependable. However, the fusion accuracy is affected by terrain factors including elevation, slope, and slope aspects. These factors have obvious negative effects on the fusion accuracy of high spatio-temporal resolution optical remote sensing data: the highest fusion accuracy occurred in areas with elevations between 1201 and 1400 m.a.s.l., and the lowest accuracy occurred in areas with elevations less than 600 m.a.s.l. For the 5 fused time series indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), normalized burn ratio (NBR), and tasseled cap angle (TCA)), the fusion accuracy decreased with increasing slope, and increasing slope had the least impact on the EVI, but the greatest negative impact on the NDVI; the slope aspect had a limited influence on the fusion accuracies of the 5 time series indices, but fusion accuracy was lowest on the northwest slope. (3) EVI had the highest accuracy of rubber plantation classification among the 5 time series indices, and the overall classification accuracies of the time series EVI for the four different years (2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015) reached 87.20% (kappa 0.82), 86.91% (kappa 0.81), 88.85% (kappa 0.84), and 89.51% (kappa 0.86), respectively. The results indicate that the method is a promising approach for rubber plantation mapping and the detection of changes in rubber plantations in this tropical area.

TI  - Using Hidden Markov Models for Land Surface Phenology: An Evaluation Across a Range of Land Cover Types in Southeast Spain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics are increasingly being used as indicators of climate change impacts in ecosystems. For this purpose, it is necessary to use methods that can be applied to large areas with different types of vegetation, including vulnerable semiarid ecosystems that exhibit high spatial variability and low signal-to-noise ratio in seasonality. In this work, we evaluated the use of hidden Markov models (HMM) to extract phenological parameters from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We analyzed NDVI time-series data for the period 2000-2018 across a range of land cover types in Southeast Spain, including rice croplands, shrublands, mixed pine forests, and semiarid steppes. Start of Season (SOS) and End of Season (EOS) metrics derived from HMM were compared with those obtained using well-established smoothing methods. When a clear and consistent seasonal variation was present, as was the case in the rice croplands, and when adjusting average curves, the smoothing methods performed as well as expected, with HMM providing consistent results. When spatial variability was high and seasonality was less clearly defined, as in the semiarid shrublands and steppe, the performance of the smoothing methods degraded. In these cases, the results from HMM were also less consistent, yet they were able to provide pixel-wise estimations of the metrics even when comparison methods did not.

TI  - Prevalence of Hypertension, Treatment, and Blood Pressure Targets in Canada Associated With the 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guidelines
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE The 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) blood pressure (BP) guidelines redefined hypertension using a BP threshold of 130/80 mm Hg or greater and applied a treatment target of less than 130/80 mm Hg.OBJECTIVE To evaluate the potential change in the diagnosis, treatment, and control of hypertension in a Canadian cohort of patients with hypertension attending primary care practices using the ACC/AHA guidelines.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study used primary care practices across Canada electronic medical record data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network, extracted as of June 30, 2015. Adults with at least 1 primary care encounter in the previous 2 years (July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2015) were included in the study. Those with current hypertension were identified using a validated definition consisting of diagnoses, billing codes, and/or antihypertensive medication from within the primary care electronic medical record. Data analysis was conducted from December 2017 to July 2018.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Proportion of individuals with a diagnosis of hypertension, prescribed antihypertensive medication, and meeting treatment BP targets.RESULTS Of the 594 492 Canadian participants included in the study, 144 348 (24.2%) had hypertension (45.6% male; mean [SD] age, 65.5 [14.5] years). On applying the ACC/AHA guidelines, 252 279 individuals (42.4%) were considered hypertensive and half (51.0%; 95% CI, 50.8%-51.2%) were prescribed an antihypertensive medication. Individuals who were not previously considered to have hypertension but were reclassified as having elevated BP using the lower cutoff of 130/80mm Hg or greater tended to be younger and were at lower cardiovascular risk. There was a shift toward more individuals requiring antihypertensive treatment, particularly in the lower-risk categories. The crude prevalence of hypertension increased from 13.3% to 32.0% in those aged 18 to 64 years, and of those aged 65 years and older, 16.6% more individuals were reclassified as having hypertension (from 55.2% to 71.8%). Only 12.3% of those who were considered at high risk were reclassified as hypertensive.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adoption of the ACC/AHA BP guidelines would result in a near doubling in the prevalence of hypertension in Canada. The changes would largely affect individuals who are younger and at low to moderate cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Effects of heavy metals identified in Chascomus shallow lake on the endocrine-reproductive axis of pejerrey fish (<i>Odontesthes bonariensis</i>)
T2  - GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Some heavy metals related to human activities were measured in the water of Chascomus lake. The maximum concentrations were: 0.23 mu g/L for Cd, 4.28 mu g/L for Cr, 22.09 mu g/L for Cu, 2.49 mu g/L for Ni, 3.24 mu g/L for Pb and 210.76 mu g/L for Zn. The values of Cd, Cr, Cr, Pb and Zn were above the Argentine National Guidelines for the Protection of the Aquatic life. The analysis of gonadal condition of pejerrey fish (Odontesthes bonariensis) from this lake did not revealed any reproductive damages. However, exposures with environmental concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu and Zn under laboratory conditions of pejerrey males (14 days), caused a significant increase of the expression of the three variants of gnrh in the brain (within Cd exposure) and a decrease in cyp19a1b mRNA (within Cu exposure). Furthermore, at pituitary level, a decrease in fshb transcript levels was observed in the fish exposed to Cd and Cr and a decrease in the expression of both gonadotropin receptors at gonadal level in Zn exposure. Moreover, the gonads of the fish exposed to all the tested metals suffered structural damages showing shortness of the spermatic lobules, fibrosis, testis ova and the presence of piknotic cells. All these findings alert that heavy metals pollution affects the expression of key reproductive genes and gonadal structure of fish species that represent the predominant group of organisms and are considered sentinel species in the aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Building Damage Assessment Using Intensity SAR Data with Different Incidence Angles and Longtime Interval
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - When carrying out change detection for building damage assessment using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images, it is desirable that the observation conditions of the images are similar and acquisition time is close to the earthquake occurrence time. In this way, the influence of the radar operating system and ground temporal changes can be minimized, facilitating high-accuracy assessment results. However, in practice, especially in poor developing areas, it is difficult to obtain ideal images owing to limited pre-event data archives. In the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake, the TerraSAR-X satellite captured the influenced Sankhu area before and after the earthquake on May 30, 2010 and May 13, 2015, respectively. The pre-event data was obtained in an ascending path with an incidence angle of 41 degrees, whereas the post-event data was obtained in a descending path with an incidence angle of 33 degrees. To apply the obtained data that had different observation conditions and longtime intervals for building damage assessment, two ways were considered and studied. On one hand, the feasibility of change detection considering these factors was investigated. Pixel statistic characteristics were analyzed in twelve test areas to check the influence of temporal changes, and building footprints were buffered considering two different incidence angles. On the other hand, the reliability of classification based on only post-event data was studied. The results showed good classification performance of some texture parameters, such as the "range value" and "standard deviation," which are worthy of further study. Moreover, the classification results obtained using the post-event data achieved similar accuracy to that using both the pre-and post-event data, preliminarily indicating the research value of post-event data-based building damage detection as it can solve the pre-event data limitation problem once and for all.

TI  - Vegetation greening trends in different land use types: natural variability versus human-induced impacts in Greece
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation greening and browning patterns in two diverse land use environments, i.e., urban areas and sites protected by environmental legislation over Greece, are evaluated and presented in this work. Urban sites correspond to areas of high man intervention, whereas the protected sites are considered as areas with least human impact and are therefore representative of the natural variability of vegetation attributed mainly to climate. Analysis of time series data in the form of least square line fitting was conducted using remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the spatio-temporal vegetation trends were examined in the two diverse land use categories. Results showed that 99% of protected sites and 95% of urban sites exhibited significant browning or greening trends (p<0.01) with greening patterns dominating in most parts of the country during all seasons. Regarding the magnitude of detected trends, protected areas demonstrated a higher greening trend both annually and seasonally. Average magnitudes of NDVI on an annual basis were computed to 2.04x10(-3)year(-1) for urban areas and 4.50x10(-3)year(-1), respectively. Higher rates of NDVI increase were detected in autumn and winter. Spatially, NDVI changes in protected sites demonstrated higher increasing trends by increasing latitude, whereas no major trend in the rate of NDVI change is evident on the east-west direction. Possible causal factors of those increasing NDVI trends, both climatic and human induced are discussed. Furthermore, the role of economic crisis during the last decade has been highlighted, which caused a dramatic drop in urban expansion all over the country, seems to have positively impacted vegetation productivity in those areas as well.

TI  - Comparison of Data Mining and GDD-Based Models in Discrimination of Maize Phenology
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Data mining approaches are designed for classification problems in which each observation is a member of one and only one class. In this study, a non-deterministic approach based on C5.0 data mining algorithm has been employed for discriminating the phenological stages of maize from emergence to dough, in a field located in Karaj, Iran. Two readily-available predictors i.e. accumulated growing degree days (AGDD) and multi-temporal LANDSAT7-extracted normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to build the decision tree. The AGDD was calculated based on three cardinal thresholds of temperature i.e. effective minimum, optimum, effective maximum. The NDVI was compared with two recently developed indices namely, enhanced vegetation index2 (EVI2) and optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) using the signal to noise ratio (SNR) criterion. Findings confirmed that these three remotely sensed indices do not have significant differences, therefore, the smoothed time series of NDVI was used in the C5.0 algorithm. The precisions of classification by C5.0 data mining algorithm in partitioning of training and testing data were approximately 90.51 and 81.77%, respectively. The mean absolute error (MAE) values of the onset of maize phenological stages were estimated about 2.6-5.3days for various stages by C5.0 model. While corresponding values for the classical AGDD model were 3.9-10.7days. This confirms the skill of data mining approach in comparison with commonly-used the classical AGDD model in applications of real time monitoring.

TI  - Improving flood monitoring in rural areas using remote sensing
T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise information on the extent of inundated land is required for flood monitoring, relief, and protective measures. In this paper, two spectral indices, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), were used to identify inundated areas during heavy rainfall events in the Tarwin catchment, Victoria, Australia, using Landsat-8 OLI imagery. By integrating the assessed condition of levees, this research also explains the inefficiency of the flood control measures of this region of Australia. NDWI and MNDWI indices performed well, but water features were enhanced better in the NDWI-derived image, with an accuracy of 96.04% and Kappa coefficient of 0.83.

TI  - Relation between urban biophysical composition and dynamics of land surface temperature in the Kolkata metropolitan area: a GIS and statistical based analysis for sustainable planning
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The major environmental impacts of urbanization have changed urban biophysical components which ultimately promoted land surface temperature (LST) as well as urban heat island (UHI). This study explores the upshot of land use land cover (LULC) and resultant effect on biophysical components to understand the heat island mechanism in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) for four selected time period of 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2017. Six satellite-derived biophysical components were selected for the present analysis: NDBI, NDVI, NDWI, MNDWI, NDBaI and SAVI. Selected bands of Landsat-5 TM and OLI-8 were used for this purpose. The result shows that the built-up area has been increased from 322.68km(2) in 1991 to 982.86km(2) in 2017 and accordingly, LST also rises from 18.47 degrees C mean LST of 1991 to 23.30 degrees C mean LST of 2017. The correlation coefficient among the biophysical parameters and LST shows that the highest continuous increasing positive relationship between NDBI and LST (R=0.71). Moreover, multiple linear regression model (MLR) is adapted to the prediction on LST with the variation of biophysical parameters. Finally, we produced hot spot maps using Getis-Ord-Gi* statistics for the selected year to highlights the hot spot and cold spot area in KMA. The methodology presented in this paper can be broadly applied for the planning purposes because LST monitoring is an important parameter of sustainable urban planning.

TI  - The Works of Johannes Bobrowski: The Poetics of the Prose
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study is to identify the features of the pioneering novelistic style, developed by Johannes Bobrowski for the depiction of complex and controversial historical problems, as well as the system of expressive principles and means (poetics), combining the traditions of the German Enlightenment novel, folklore, and modern experiments in prose. The writer's original worldview and specifics of the artistic development of German history manifest themselves in the poetics of the analyzed novels "Levin's Mill" ("Levins Muhle") and "Lithuanian Pianos" ("Litauische Claviere"). It is unique and complex, rich with both traditional literary techniques and bold innovative elements. The author of the article concludes that through the pioneering novelistic style, characters' images, their speech, and rich poetic worldview, Bobrowski depicted German history, projecting the life of the people on modern human existence. This allowed the German writer to leave a unique mark in the history of the 20th-century novel.

TI  - PSYCHIATRY AS NORMATIVE PRACTICE
T2  - PHILOSOPHY PSYCHIATRY & PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article develops a conceptual framework of norm-responsive aspects of psychiatric practice. This framework is meant to support and conceptualize the idea that the practice of psychiatry is inherently value laden and responding to norms, principles, values, and ideals. I argue that these norms, principles, values, and ideals manifest a certain order, with qualifying, foundational, and conditioning norms and principles on the one hand and regulative ideals and core values on the other hand. These norms and principles are constitutive for psychiatric practice and define its inherently normative conditions. They are necessary elements, without which the practice of psychiatry cannot properly be understood. The core values and ideals on the other hand are the expression of ultimate concerns and an instantiation of the ethos of the profession. This ethos harbors an implicit worldview and orients and directs psychiatric practice to the kind of endeavor it is meant to be. The inherent normative nature of psychiatric practice is first approached by analyzing the web of relations that shape the interactions between professionals and patients. This exposition is followed by an analysis of the different norms and values that are operational within psychiatric practice itself. This analysis leads to the delineation of a normative practice approach of psychiatric practice. The distinction between different types of norms helps to elucidate weaknesses of scientistic and technicistic approaches in psychiatry. I show how the normative practice approach provides a richer, more nuanced, and more convincing account of psychiatry's legitimacy.

TI  - Limitations of high resolution satellite stereo imagery for estimating canopy Check for height in Australian tropical savannas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining reliable measures of tree canopy height across large areas is a central element of forest inventory and carbon accounting. Recent years have seen an increased emphasis on the use of active sensors like Radar and airborne LiDAR (light detection and scanning) systems to estimate various 3D characteristics of canopy and crown structure that can be used as predictors of biomass. However, airborne LiDAR data are expensive to acquire, and not often readily available across large remote landscapes. In this study, we evaluated the potential of stereo imagery from commercially available Very High Resolution (VHR) satellites as an alternative for estimating canopy height variables in Australian tropical savannas, using a semi-global dense matching (SGM) image-based technique. We assessed and compared the completeness and vertical accuracy of extracted canopy height models (CHMs) from GeoEye 1 and WorldView 1 VHR satellite stereo pairs and summarised the factors influencing image matching effectiveness and quality.Our results showed that stereo dense matching using the SGM technique severely underestimates tree presence and canopy height. The highest tree detection rates were achieved by using the near-infrared (NIR) band of GEl (8-9%). WV1-GE1 cross-satellite (mixed) models did not improve the quality of extracted canopy heights. We consider these poor detection rates and height retrievals to result from: i) the clumping crown structure of the dominant Eucalyptus spp.; ii) their vertically oriented leaves (affecting the bidirectional reflectance distribution function); iii) image band radiometry and iv) wind induced crown movement affecting stereo-pair point matching. Our detailed analyses suggest that current commercially available VHR satellite data (0.5 m resolution) are not well suited to estimating canopy height variables, and therefore above ground biomass (AGB), in Eucalyptus dominated north Australian tropical savanna woodlands.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses the children's drawings of the Bystrinskiye Evens living in Kamchatka, with the aim of investigating the traditional worldview components and representational potential of the regional image. It is based on a retrospective analysis of the previously unpublished archival data of Elizaveta Orlova (1899-1976) - the ethnographer who studied this ethnic enclave in Kamchatka in the first half of the 20 th century and collected visual materials on their culture. The article also examines contemporary children's pictures of the Bystrinskiye Evens, drawing on the materials collected in the museums of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy and villages in the Bystrinskiy region as well as interviews with local residents taken in August 2018. The authors specifically explore the pictures drawn in the 1920s to 1930s as a tool for analysing their traditional culture and give interpretation of the symbolic and factual information encoded in those pictures. Special attention is paid to contemporary children's pictures of the Bystrinskiye Evens. They conclude that the children's drawings reflect a revived interest in the traditional culture and crafts among the Bystrinskiye Evens, on the one hand, and may be seen as one of the ways to preserve their own identity in a multi-ethnic environment and as a boundary separating locals from newcomers, on the other.

TI  - Use of Sentinel-2 Time-Series Images for Classification and Uncertainty Analysis of Inherent Biophysical Property: Case of Soil Texture Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus program provides multispectral remote sensing data at decametric spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. The objective of this work is to evaluate the ability of Sentinel-2 time-series data to enable classification of an inherent biophysical property, in terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation. The tested inherent biophysical property was the soil texture. Soil texture classification was performed on each individual Sentinel-2 image with a linear support vector machine. Two sources of uncertainty were studied: uncertainties due to the Sentinel-2 acquisition date and uncertainties due to the soil sample selection in the training dataset. The first uncertainty analysis was achieved by analyzing the diversity of classification results obtained from the time series of soil texture classifications, considering that the temporal resolution is akin to a repetition of spectral measurements. The second uncertainty analysis was achieved from each individual Sentinel-2 image, based on a bootstrapping procedure corresponding to 100 independent classifications obtained with different training data. The Simpson index was used to compute this diversity in the classification results. This work was carried out in an Indian cultivated region (84 km(2), part of Berambadi catchment, in the Karnataka state). It used a time-series of six Sentinel-2 images acquired from February to April 2017 and 130 soil surface samples, collected over the study area and characterized in terms of texture. The classification analysis showed the following: (i) each single-date image analysis resulted in moderate performances for soil texture classification, and (ii) high confusion was obtained between neighboring textural classes, and low confusion was obtained between remote textural classes. The uncertainty analysis showed that (i) the classification of remote textural classes (clay and sandy loam) was more certain than classifications of intermediate classes (sandy clay and sandy clay loam), (ii) a final soil textural map can be produced depending on the allowed uncertainty, and iii) a higher level of allowed uncertainty leads to increased bare soil coverage. These results illustrate the potential of Sentinel-2 for providing input for modeling environmental processes and crop management.

TI  - Ice dynamics of union glacier from SAR offset tracking
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Antarctic ice sheet is predicted to be the major contributor to sea-level rise during the XXI century. Therefore, monitoring ice dynamics of outlet glaciers in Antarctica is of great importance to assess future sea-level rise predictions. Union Glacier is one of the major outlet glaciers of the Ellsworth Mountains and drains into the Ronne-Filchner Ice Shelf. Glaciers can be studied using remote-sensing techniques, which combined with field measurements can deliver a good approximation of its dynamics and can be used as input for glacier models. In this study we acquired high resolution Stripmap HIMAGE SAR images from the COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation during austral summer of 2011-2012, and applied a SAR offset tracking algorithm to compute ice velocities. Then, we compared our derived velocities with field data already published. Results showed mean values of ice velocity estimated for the main trunk of the glacier are 0.043 (0.0393 SD) m d(-1), with values reaching up to 0.325 m d(-1), in agreement with previous studies. A model of ice thickness based on lamellar flow theory is proposed, using estimated surface ice velocity in combination with surface slope derived from TanDEM-X as input data. Comparison of our modeled ice thickness with radar data agree with a mean absolute deviation of 19.22%. From surface ice velocities we computed principal strain rates in order to assess crevasse formation and closure. Thereafter, using high resolution COSMO-SkyMed Spotlight-2 SAR images we establish a relation between surface features and acting strain components.

TI  - The microbiomic and environmental analysis of sediments in the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) habitat in the Northern Beibu Gulf, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern Beibu Gulf is one of the major habitats for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) in China. In this habitat, the core distribution zone of humpback dolphins was confined to the Sanniang Bay (SNB) and Dafengjiang River Estuary (DRE) areas. In our present research, the sediments of 14 sampling sites across the SNB and DRE waters were collected and further conducted for microbiomic and environmental analysis to explore the ecosystem characteristics of major humpback dolphin habitats in Northern Beibu Gulf. The environmental condition includes ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), sulfur content in the form of sulfuric acid (SO42--S), Fe, and heavy metals (including Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, and As). The composition of the bacterial community was characterized by 16S ribosomal DNA analysis of the V3-V4 regions using the Illumina-based sequencing platform. The environmental characteristic of the nutrient elements and heavy metals indicated that SNB suffered more anthropogenic impact than DRE. The comparably higher concentration of NH4+-N, NO3--N, DRP, Pb, and Cd in the SNB region was detected. The comparably higher nutrients in the SNB may have resulted in higher biomass and lower dissolved oxygen (DO) profile, which was further proved by Landsat thermal image data. The microbiome analysis showed that the DRE region was oligotrophic and SNB reflected an anaerobic environment in the sediments. Environmental factors rather than the spatial distance determined the similarity of bacterial community among different sites. Ecological associations between environmental, oceanographic, and bacterial characteristics were illustrated, which exhibited strong mutual associations. Our findings presented a feasibility that integrates empirical and remote sensing data to distinguish ecological features and evaluate ecosystem healthiness for the humpback dolphin habitats.

TI  - Thresholding technique for flood extent mapping using dual polarization ENVISAT ASAR data
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The research paper explores an optimum water extraction technique using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to give the flood inundation map for irregular flood scenario, in which the planned algorithm depends on thresholding technique using MRS amplitude SAR data. For classification, supervised maximum likelihood method is used, and gamma filtering technique was used for speckle removal. Since water layer in SAR data has low amplitude value, thresholding technique for amplitude SAR data could efficiently take out water layer. The mean backscatter basics of water layers in SAR data is not to be compared with inundated regions caused by sharp release and is not considered as a terrain value. The speckle filtering method was used for the power generated noise subtraction using a window size 5x5. The threshold values were calculated from backscatter values and their average was taken as threshold, which gives clear difference of backscatter values between the land and the water in the river and the flood plain areas. The maximum likelihood classifier provides 99% overall accuracy. The Landsat 5 TM data was used in this research for delineating water feature and flood accurately. The results obtained from SAR data were validated with Landsat TM data. Finally, the flood inundation map using optical data and SAR data was generated.

TI  - Relationships between the NDVI, Yield of Spring Wheat, and Properties of the Plow Horizon of Eluviated Clay-Illuvial Chernozems and Dark Gray Soils
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - On the Cis-Salair Plain with well-drained soils, the statistical dependence of the yield of spring wheat and NDVI on some properties of the plow horizon in eluviated clay-illuvial agrochernozems (Luvic Greyzemic Chernozems) and agro-dark gray soils (Luvic Retic Greyzemic Phaeozems) was studied. In the regression model, the NDVI was shown to be responsible for 85% of the variation in the yield of spring wheat. Using the model and the spatial distribution of NDVI as the cartographic base, the prediction and visualization of the spatial variability of the spring wheat yield was performed. The spring wheat productivity and the NDVI proved to be insignificantly different for the agro-dark gray soils and agrochernozems. The correlation was significant between the yield of spring wheat and the NDVI, on one hand, and the pre-sowing water content (r = 0.52; r = 0.57) and the content of exchangeable potassium (r(s) = 0.58; r(s) = 0.61), on the other hand; the correlation with the contents of humus (r = 0.35; r = 0.38), available phosphorus (r(s) = 0.32; r(s) = 0.35), and mobile zinc (r(s) = 0.42; r(s) = 0.48) was moderate. Relatively high contents of mobile forms of macro- and microelements in soils correlated with higher values of the presowing water content.

TI  - Aerosol model evaluation using two geostationary satellites over East Asia in May 2016
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study newly applies measurements from two geostationary satellites, the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the geostationary satellite Himawari-8 and the Geostationary Ocean Color imager (GOCI) onboard the geostationary satellite COMS, to evaluate a unique regional aerosol-transport model coupled to a non-hydrostatic icosahedral atmospheric model (NICAM) at a high resolution without any nesting technique and boundary conditions of the aerosols. Taking advantage of the unique capability of these geostationary satellites to measure aerosols with unprecedentedly high temporal resolution, we focus on a target area (115 degrees E-155 degrees E, 20 degrees N-50 degrees N) in East Asia in May 2016, which featured the periodic transport of industrial aerosols and a very heavy aerosol plume from Siberian wildfires. The aerosol optical thickness (AOT) fields are compared among the AHI, GOCI, MODIS, AERONET and NICAM data. The results show that both AHI- and GOCI-retrieved AOTs were generally comparable to the AERONET-retrieved cones, with high correlation coefficients of approximately 0.7 in May 2016. They also show that NICAM successfully captured the detailed horizontal distribution of AOT transported from Siberia to Japan on the most polluted day (18 May 2016). The monthly statistical metrics, including correlation between the model and either AHI or GOCI, are estimated to be > 0.4 in 42-49% of the target area. With the aid of sensitivity model experiments with and without Siberian wildfires, it was found that a long-range transport of aerosols from Siberian wildfires (from as far as 3000 km) to Japan influenced the monthly mean aerosol levels, accounting for 7-35% of the AOT, 26-49% of the surface PM2.5 concentrations, and 25-66% of the aerosol extinction above 3 km in height over Japan. Therefore, the air pollutants from Siberian wildfire cannot be ignored for the spring over Japan.

TI  - The role of flexibility in enabling transformational social change: Perspectives from an Indigenous community using Q-methodology
T2  - GEOFORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - What makes some communities more resilient and transformative than others? This paper explores the hypothesis that the flexibility of perspectives is central to enable the kind of changes called for by current and future environmental and socio-economic challenges. The paper reports on findings from a Q-study conducted with the Indigenous community of Igiugig, Alaska, focusing on perceptions of social change. The study reveals three main narratives concerning drivers of social change, focusing on the role of individuals, the importance of cultural values, and community visioning. The findings from the Q study point to the importance of flexibility, understood as the capacity to take different perspectives, in enabling deliberate action in situations where the correct path to take is often contested. This kind of flexibility, grounded in an Indigenous worldview, is seen to contribute to community resilience through supporting cultural cohesion, collective leadership and enacting alternatives in the here and now. Strong community narratives that allow for individual interpretation is seen as important and highlights the interrelatedness between the individual and the collective and the role of collective agency. Drawing on the critiques of the concept of resilience in an Indigenous context, the paper further points to the need for transformational change occurring at multiple scales and extends a call for flexibility to be fostered among researchers and practitioners alike. The lessons from this community have implications for understandings of community resilience and agency in social-ecological systems and the potential for transformations towards sustainability.

TI  - Armenia-Turkey border opening: what determines the attitude of Armenians?
T2  - CAUCASUS SURVEY
M3  - Article
AB  - In spite of all previous efforts, the land border between Armenia and Turkey remains closed. Being one of the last reminders of the Cold War era, it significantly hinders the development of Armenia and eastern regions of Turkey. However, a closed border is more than a physical obstacle, as it also shapes the worldview and perceptions of the respective societies. Using the recent survey on "Public Opinion Poll: The Ways for Normalization of Armenian-Turkish Relations", we identify the determinants of respondents' attitudes towards the opening of the border. Among other results, we find that more awareness of the current Armenian-Turkish relationship increases the likelihood of the approval of the border. However, when selecting those respondents, who are either loyal to or approve the opening of the border, the awareness of the protocols' content decreases the likelihood of the approval of the opening border. Our findings are supported by the contact theory which we use as a conceptual framework.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells on disease recurrence in patients with early-stage cervical cancer.Methods We included patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA1 with lymphvascular space invasion, stage IA2, and IB1 who participated in the SENTICOL1 trial. A centralized histologic analysis with re-reading and ultrastaging was performed 3 months after surgery and treatment was not impacted by findings from our study. Patients were followed for 3 years and outcomes were compared according to prognostic factors.Results A total of 139 patients were included and 13 recurrences were found. There were two recurrences in patients with positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) (one macrometastases and one micrometastases) and 11 recurrences in patients with negative lymph nodes (sentinel or non-sentinel). Among patients with positive SLN for micrometastases there was only one recurrence. No patient with isolated tumor cells on their lymph nodes experienced a recurrence. There was a significant decrease in disease-free survival in patients aged >50 years (p = 0.01).Conclusion Evidence of micrometastasis or isolated tumor cells in the SLN of untreated patients with early cervical cancer in the SENTICOL1 trial did not impact progression-free survival.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater samples were collected in May 2015 from 23 wells distributed in the western part of Wadi Nisah, mainly used for irrigation. Calculation of saturation indices showed that the samples were generally undersaturated with respect to halite, gypsum, anhydrite, calcite, and aragonite. Groundwater facies analysis showed that most of the collected samples were dominated by Ca-Na-SO4-type water. This water type indicates rock-water interaction, mainly gypsum dissolution. The second major water type was Na-Ca-SO4. Evaporation is the major process that controls the groundwater chemistry in the study area. Principal component analysis resulted in the extraction of two principal components. All the elements analyzed showed significant positive factor loading in the first principal component (PC1) except NO3 and Pb which showed high negative loadings in the second principal component (PC2). R-mode cluster analysis identified two groups of variables. The variables in Group 1 are the result of rock-water interaction and contamination by human and agricultural activities. Variables in Group 2 represent the dissolution of evaporite minerals. The total dissolved solids' (TDS) results demonstrated that the water samples could be classified as either brackish or freshwater. The high TDS concentration in the brackish samples could be a result of soil-water interaction. Moreover, human activities, especially those producing agricultural and household wastewater, can increase TDS in groundwater. Remote-sensing results demonstrated that the areas of agricultural and urban land use have increased with time and have contributed to groundwater pollution.

TI  - Analysis and Correction of Digital Elevation Models for Plain Areas
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water movement modeling in plain areas requires digital elevation models (DEMs) adequately representing the morphological and geomorphological land patterns including the presence of civil structures that could affect water flow patterns. This has a direct effect on water accumulation and water flow direction. The objectives of this work were to analyze, compare and improve DEMs so surface water movement in plain areas could be predicted. In order to do that, we evaluated the accuracy of a digital elevation data set consisting in 4064 points measured with a differential global positioning system (GPS) in a plain area of central Buenos Aires province. Three DEMs were analyzed: (1) the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), (2) the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and (3) the Advanced Land Observing Satellite with the Phased Array Type L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR). Several topographic attributes (i.e., height, surface area, land slope, delimitation of geomorphological units, civil structures, basin boundaries and streams network) and different interpolation methods were analyzed. The results showed that both the SRTM and the ALOS PALSAR DEMs had a +/- 4.4 m root mean square error (RMSE) in contrast to the ASTER DEM which had a +/- 9 m RMSE. Our analysis proved that the best DEM representing the study area is the SRTM. The most suitable interpolation methods applied to the SRTM were the inverse distance weighting and the ANUDEM, whereas the spline method displayed the lowest vertical accuracy. With the proposed method we obtained a DEM for the study area with a +/- 3.2 m RMSE, a 33% error reduction compared to the raw DEM.

TI  - Impact of the Revisit of Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing Observations on Evapotranspiration UncertaintyA Sensitivity Study Using AmeriFlux Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared remote sensing observations have been widely used to provide useful information on surface energy and water stress for estimating evapotranspiration (ET). However, the revisit time of current high spatial resolution (<100 m) thermal infrared remote sensing systems, sixteen days for Landsat for example, can be insufficient to reliably derive ET information for water resources management. We used in situ ET measurements from multiple Ameriflux sites to (1) evaluate different scaling methods that are commonly used to derive daytime ET estimates from time-of-day observations; and (2) quantify the impact of different revisit times on ET estimates at monthly and seasonal time scales. The scaling method based on a constant evaporative ratio between ET and the top-of-atmosphere solar radiation provided slightly better results than methods using the available energy, the surface solar radiation or the potential ET as scaling reference fluxes. On average, revisit time periods of 2, 4, 8 and 16 days resulted in ET uncertainties of 0.37, 0.55, 0.73 and 0.90 mm per day in summer, which represented 13%, 19%, 23% and 31% of the monthly average ET calculated using the one-day revisit dataset. The capability of a system to capture rapid changes in ET was significantly reduced for return periods higher than eight days. The impact of the revisit on ET depended mainly on the land cover type and seasonal climate, and was higher over areas with high ET. We did not observe significant and systematic differences between the impacts of the revisit on monthly ET estimates that are based on morning or afternoon observations. We found that four-day revisit scenarios provided a significant improvement in temporal sampling to monitor surface ET reducing by around 40% the uncertainty of ET products derived from a 16-day revisit system, such as Landsat for instance.

TI  - Integrating Geochemical Anomaly and Remote Sensing Methods to Predict Oil- and Gas-Bearing Areas in the Yanchang Oil Field, Ordos Basin, China
T2  - EARTH SCIENCES RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil seepage is one of the most important characteristics of hydrocarbon formation, and understanding oil seepage is crucial for oil-gas exploration and the assessment of petroleum resources. Remote sensing and geochemical methods have the same material and theoretical bases for extracting oil and gas information from underlying strata and the identification of media features. As an emerging exploration method, hyperspectral remote sensing is efficient compared with traditional geochemistry because it is a finer, and sometimes more directly quantitative method for determining the specific mineral anomaly content. Hence, the use of both methods together is important. This paper describes the analysis of hyperspectral remote sensing data and the extraction of abnormal index information, including the level of carbonate alteration and the content of acidolytical hydrocarbons, pyrolysis hydrocarbons, headspace gas, and ferric and ferrous ions. The two methods have mutual authentication, and they are complementary and are useful in oil-bearing areas. When these methods are integrated, the acidolytical hydrocarbon index is the most effective geochemical index and is better at characterizing the oil field distribution than other indices. Also, hydrocarbon geochemical anomalies occurring in oil fields generally show continuous distribution points and are consistent with oil reservoirs. Consequently, a 3D model was established to comprehensively utilize hyperspectral remote sensing and geochemical data to determine the distribution of petroleum reservoirs efficiently as well as to delineate oil-and gas-bearing prospects. There is great potential for determining oil-and gas-bearing fields through the integration of hyperspectral and geochemical data.

TI  - Surgical and Oncologic Outcomes of Radical Abdominal Trachelectomy Versus Hysterectomy for Stage IA2-IB1 Cervical Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective: To compare the surgical and oncologic outcomes between abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART) and radical hysterectomy (RH) for stage IA2-IB1 cervical cancer.Design: A retrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Setting: Shandong Cancer Hospital, Shandong, China.Patients: Three hundred twenty-nine patients with IA2-IB1 cervical cancer.Interventions: All patients underwent ART or RH.Measurements and Main Results: All patients were divided into ART (n = 143) and RH (n = 186) groups according to the surgical approach. Additionally, oncologic and fertility outcomes were compared for different tumor pathologies and sizes in ART patients. The ART group had similar case characteristics as the RH group, except that the ART group had a longer surgical time. During a similar follow-up period, there were 4 (2.9%) recurrences and 3 (2.2%) patients who died from recurrence in the ART group compared with 8 (4.6%) recurrences and 4 (2.3%) patients who died from recurrence in the RH group (p = .444 and p = .999, respectively). In the ART group, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients had a 5-year overall survival and pregnancy rate similar to those of non-SCC patients (98.1% vs 96.8%, p = .999; 33.3% vs 26.7%, p = .873), and patients with tumors <= 2 cm and 2 to 4 cm experienced a similar 5-year overall survival rate (97.0% vs 98.6%, p = .999), except patients with tumors <= 2 cm had a higher pregnancy rate (45.2% vs 17.2%, p = .020).Conclusion: ART seems to have similar surgical and oncologic outcomes to RH, except ART has a longer surgical time. Both non-SCC patients and stage IA2-IB1 patients with 2- to 4-cm tumors can undergo ART safely. Patients with tumors <= 2 cm have a higher pregnancy rate than patients with 2- to 4-cm tumors.

TI  - Spatial Distribution and Simulation of Cropland Abandonment in Wushan County, Chongqing, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland abandonment (CRA) is an extreme case of cropland marginalization. With the continuous development of global industrialization and urbanization, the phenomenon of CRA gradually spreads from developed countries such as eastern and western European countries and the United States to developing countries such as China, especially in regions with poor geographical conditions such as mountainous areas. However, research on CRA in developing countries is sparse, and adequate identification methods and spatial distribution information are lacking in China, impeding the comprehensive understanding of the status quo of CRA as well as the formulation of related policies and measures. Therefore, taking Wushan County in Chongqing as an example, we developed a CRA extraction method to identify cropland. Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS remote sensing images were adopted in the extraction. Subsequently, Google Earth images were used to verify the extraction results, and the extraction accuracy of abandoned cropland plaques reached 89.33%. The CRA rate in Wushan between 2011 and 2016 was 28.71%, and abandoned cropland was highly scattered across the region. In areas above 800 m and with slopes of more than 15 degrees, large areas were abandoned. However, an increasing irrigation radius resulted in higher labor costs and, ultimately, larger abandoned areas. Using the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects-Small (CLUE-S) model, the CRA status under different scenarios was simulated, and under the scenario of economic development, the CRA rate in the next 20 years was as low as 28.84%, while under the scenario of natural growth, the rate reached 33.54%. When the model used the scenario of ecological protection, the cropland area in Wushan County decreased significantly, and the CRA rate reached 42.11%.

TI  - Efficiency of post-stratification for a large-scale forest inventory-case Finnish NFI
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Key messagePost-stratification based on remotely sensed data is an efficient method in estimating regional-level results in the operational National Forest Inventory. It also enables calculating the results accurately for smaller areas than with the default method of using the field plots only.ContextThe utilization of auxiliary information in survey sampling through model-assisted estimation or post-stratification has gained popularity in forest inventory recently. However, post-stratification at a large scale involves practical concerns such as the availability of auxiliary data independent of the sample at hand, and a large number of variables for which the results are needed.AimsWe assessed the efficiency of two different types of post-stratification, either post-stratifying for each variable of interest separately or using one post-stratification for all variables, compared to the estimation based on the field sample plots only. In addition, we examined the precision of area and volume estimates, and the efficiency of post-stratification at different spatial scales.MethodsFor post-stratification, we used the volume maps based on Landsat satellite imagery, digital map data, and the sample plot data of the previous inventory. The efficiencies of post-stratifications based on the mean volume and the mean volumes by tree species were compared.ResultsIn estimating the total volume, the relative efficiency of post-stratification compared to field plot based estimation was 1.54-3.54 over the provinces in South Finland. In estimating the volumes by tree species groups, the relative efficiency was 0.93-2.39. The gain with a separate stratification compared to the stratification based on total mean volume for all variables was at largest 0.69. In the small test areas, the relative standard errors of the total volume estimates decreased on average by 33% by using post-stratification instead of sample plots only. The mean relative efficiency was 2.36.ConclusionThe utilization of an old forest resources map and post-stratification based on the mean volume is an operational approach for the National Forest Inventory. Post-stratification also enables calculating the results accurately for markedly smaller areas than with the field plots only. Post-stratification reduced the probability of very high sampling variances, making the results more robust.

TI  - Impacts of Partly Cloudy Pixels on Shortwave Broadband Irradiance Computations
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the limitation of the spatial resolution of satellite sensors, satellite pixels identified as cloudy are often partly cloudy. For the first time, this study demonstrates the bias in shortwave (SW) broadband irradiances for partly cloudy pixels when the cloud optical depths are retrieved with an overcast and homogeneous assumption, and subsequently, the retrieved values are used for the irradiance computations. The sign of the SW irradiance bias is mainly a function of viewing geometry of the cloud retrieval. The bias in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) upward SW irradiances is positive for small viewing zenith angles (VZAs) similar to 60 degrees. For a given solar zenith angle and viewing geometry, the magnitude of the bias increases with the cloud optical depth and reaches a maximum at the cloud fraction between 0.2 and 0.8. The sign of the SW surface net irradiance bias is opposite of the sign of TOA upward irradiance bias, with a similar magnitude. As a result, the bias in absorbed SW irradiances by the atmosphere is smaller than the biases in both TOA and surface irradiances. The monthly mean biases in SW irradiances due to partly cloudy pixels are <1.5 W m(-2) when cloud properties are derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Aqua.

TI  - The Impact of Tsunami on Mangrove Spatial Change in Eastern Coastal of Biak Island, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted to find out how large was the impact of the tsunami incident of 1996 on the mangrove spatial change and also to understand the distribution and level of mangrove density before and after tsunami in Biak Island (Oridek District and East Biak District), Biak Numfor Regency, Indonesia. In order to determine the condition of mangrove before tsunami, landsat 5 TM satellite image acquisition of July 6, 1994 and landsat 7 ETM+ satellite image acquisition of August 31, 2000 were used. The information about the distribution and extent of mangroves was obtained by analyzing the spectral values based on color composite image (RGB 453) and NDVI analysis. Overlay map of the result satellite image interpretation was used to learn the change of mangrove spatial extent area due to tsunami. The result showed that the mangrove area before the tsunami was 286.83 Ha (high density 36.63 Ha, medium density 140.60 Ha and small density 109.60 Ha), meanwhile the mangrove extent area after the tsunami was 102.51 Ha (high density 24.39 Ha, medium density 22,86 Ha and small density 55.26 Ha). The mangrove conditions before tsunami were crucial to the impact of mangrove area degradation directly. The change of mangrove spatial extent into two districts after tsunami occurred in 1996 amounts to 184.32 Ha, which it approximately 202.50 Ha mangrove being lost and the addition of mangrove in the new area are 18.18 Ha. The tsunami that occurred in 1996 affected the coastal ecosystems, especially the mangrove ecosystems in Oridek District.

TI  - Establishment of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Prediction Model Based on MAIAC AOD Data of High Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term exposure to seriously polluted atmospheric environment is closely related to a variety of human diseases. The long-term and continuous monitoring of PM2.5 (the aerodynamic particle diameter is less than or equal to 2.5 mu m) is of great significance as it is one of the major air pollutants. Because of the small number of PM2.5 monitoring stations in China, it is very difficult to accurately estimate the continuous scale of air pollution, but PM2.5 concentration can be acquired by using the aerosol products inversed by remote sensing data. However, due to the limitation of the inversion algorithm, the traditionally used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol products cannot meet the precision and practical requirements in both spatial resolution and effective numerical coverage. This paper adopts MAIAC AOD, i.e. the aerosol optical depth (AOD) products produced by using the new multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) algorithm, and we take the Beijing- Tianjin-Hebei region in China as the research area. Based on the neural network algorithm, the MAIAC AOD data is mainly used and the meteorological parameter data is supplemented to establish the PM2.5 concentration prediction model to obtain the PM2.5 concentration distribution map. The prediction accuracy, the effective numerical coverage and spatial resolution have been greatly improved.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Open and Vegetated Water Bodies Using Sentinel 1 to Map African Malaria Vector Mosquito Breeding Habitats
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Providing timely and accurate maps of surface water is valuable for mapping malaria risk and targeting disease control interventions. Radar satellite remote sensing has the potential to provide this information but current approaches are not suitable for mapping African malarial mosquito aquatic habitats that tend to be highly dynamic, often with emergent vegetation. We present a novel approach for mapping both open and vegetated water bodies using serial Sentinel-1 imagery for Western Zambia. This region is dominated by the seasonally inundated Upper Zambezi floodplain that suffers from a number of public health challenges. The approach uses open source segmentation and machine learning (extra trees classifier), applied to training data that are automatically derived using freely available ancillary data. Refinement is implemented through a consensus approach and Otsu thresholding to eliminate false positives due to dry flat sandy areas. The results indicate a high degree of accuracy (mean overall accuracy 92% st dev 3.6) providing a tractable solution for operationally mapping water bodies in similar large river floodplain unforested environments. For the period studied, 70% of the total water extent mapped was attributed to vegetated water, highlighting the importance of mapping both open and vegetated water bodies for surface water mapping.

TI  - How war, drought, and dam management impact water supply in the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - The fast-paced conflicts in the Middle East can disrupt management and supply of water, particularly on dams and barrages along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that have experienced threats or changes in sovereignty. Water supply is also under pressure from upstream water management, drought, and structural decline. In this research, we used a satellite-based algorithm, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), to monitor changes in the extent of surface reservoirs (1985-present). We compared the timeline of reservoir fluctuations with the timeline of events related to conflicts, droughts, and dam management. Our results show that the most sudden changes in water supply occurred during events related to conflict, but conflict was not often a cause of the greatest absolute changes to reservoir area. Though not as precise as on-the-ground information, satellite data can give insights to water supply when conflict has disrupted the flow of information or restricted on-the-ground data collection.

AB  - This study aims to improve and investigate the levitation stability and mechanism of restoring force on an acoustically levitated droplet. To better understand the stable manipulation conditions of a droplet in an acoustic levitator, we experimentally investigated the unsteady translational motion of the acoustically levitated droplet. Furthermore, we visualized its translational motion in the horizontal and vertical (x and y) directions using a high-speed video-camera and estimated the dynamics of a droplet using four distinct levitated samples. The ratio of the levitated samples' translational frequency, which is obtained by dividing the frequency in they direction, f(y), with that in the x direction, f(x), was 3.4, which is equal to the restoring force coefficients. We found that our experimental data agree with the calculation results of a previous study. Our insights could pave the way to manipulate the dynamic behavior of a levitated sample for achieving more stable levitation. (C) 2019 Author(s).

TI  - Sclerocollum saudii Al-Jahdali, 2010 (Acanthocephala: Cavisomidae) as a sentinel for heavy-metal pollution in the Red Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, fish helminth parasites, especially cestodes and acanthocephalans, are regarded as sentinel organisms to elucidate metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems. Here, 34 specimens of the fish Siganus rivulatus were collected in the Red Sea, from a seriously polluted, small lagoon named Sharm-Elmaya Bay, at Sharm El-Sheikh, South Sinai, Egypt; 22 (64.7%) were infected by Sclerocollum saudii (Acanthocephala: Cavisomidae). Thus, 22 natural infrapopulations (26-245 individuals) of this parasite were collected from infected fish. Samples of water and sediments from the bay, samples of muscle, intestine and liver from each fish, and samples from the parasite were taken for analysis of heavy metals (cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb)). Both Cd and Pb concentrations in sediments were higher than those in water. The concentration of these metals were significantly higher in tissues (intestine, liver and muscle) of non-infected fish than those in infected fish, with Pb concentrations consistently higher than those of Cd, and both were drastically decreased in the order: liver > intestine > muscle. Metal concentrations in this acanthocephalan were much higher than those in its fish host. There were strong negative relationships between metal concentrations in tissues (intestine, liver and muscle) of infected fish and infrapopulation size, and between metal concentrations in the acanthocephalan and its infrapopulation size. These relationships strongly suggest competition for these metals between the fish host and its acanthocephalan parasite, and intraspecific competition among acanthocephalan individuals for available metals in the fish intestine. Bioconcentration factors were relatively high, since the mean Cd concentration in S. saudii was 239, 68 and 329 times higher than those in intestine, liver and muscle tissues, respectively, of its fish host. Also, mean Pb concentration was 55, 13 and 289 times higher than those in these tissues, respectively. The host-parasite system described here seems to be promising for biomonitoring of metal pollution in the Red Sea.

TI  - Detecting global urban expansion over the last three decades using a fully convolutional network
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effective detection of global urban expansion is the basis of understanding urban sustainability. We propose a fully convolutional network (FCN) and employ it to detect global urban expansion from 1992-2016. We found that the global urban land area increased from 274.7 thousand km(2)-621.1 thousand km(2), which is an increase of 346.4 thousand km(2) and a growth by 1.3 times. The results display a relatively high accuracy with an average kappa index of 0.5, which is 0.3 higher than those of existing global urban expansion datasets. Three major advantages of the proposed FCN contribute to the improved accuracy, including the integration ofmulti-source remotely sensed data, the combination of features at multiple scales, and the ability to address the lack of training samples for historical urban land. Thus, the proposed FCN has great potential to effectively detect global urban expansion.

TI  - Reduced Prediction Saturation and View Effects for Estimating the Leaf Area Index of Winter Wheat
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Relationships between vegetation indices (VIs) and leaf area index (LAI) tend to saturate in the nadir direction, and vary with crop canopy structure and view zenith angles (VZAs). The objective of this paper was to improve the monitoring accuracy and angular stability of VIs for estimating LAI using multiangular remote sensing data. The relationship between LAI and ground-based hyperspectral spectral reflectance was quantified in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) exhibiting erectophile and planophile growth habits. To further reduce the saturation, species specificity, and angular sensitivity, we developed a saturation factor (SF), based on near-infrared and green bands. Multiplying all VIs by SF greatly improved the association with LAI across all VZAs (R-2 = 0.73-0.82). Most VI x SF values, particularly optimized soil-adjusted VI x SF, were able to construct universal algorithms across VZAs for accurate estimation of LAI due to the sensitivity of SF to LAI in a dense canopy, and the insensitivity of SF to view effects with larger VZAs. This approach is also promising for the exploitation of multiangular satellite data for the design and calibration of nonview-angle-corrected spectral reflectance, for which the sensor is only deployed at fixed observation direction.

TI  - Feature Comparison and Optimization for 30-M Winter Wheat Mapping Based on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Data Using Random Forest Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat cropland is one of the most important agricultural land-cover types affected by the global climate and human activity. Mapping 30-m winter wheat cropland can provide beneficial reference information that is necessary for understanding food security. To date, machine learning algorithms have become an effective tool for the rapid identification of winter wheat at regional scales. Algorithm implementation is based on constructing and selecting many features, which makes feature set optimization an important issue worthy of discussion. In this study, the accurate mapping of winter wheat at 30-m resolution was realized using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) data, and a random forest algorithm. This paper also discusses the optimal combination of features suitable for cropland extraction. The results revealed that: (1) the random forest algorithm provided robust performance using multi-features (MFs), multi-feature subsets (MFSs), and multi-patterns (MPs) as input parameters. Moreover, the highest accuracy (94%) for winter wheat extraction occurred in three zones, including: pure farmland, urban mixed areas, and forest areas. (2) Spectral reflectance and the crop growth period were the most essential features for crop extraction. The MFSs combined with the three to four feature types enabled the high-precision extraction of 30-m winter wheat plots. (3) The extraction accuracy of winter wheat in three zones with multiple geographical environments was affected by certain dominant features, including spectral bands (B), spectral indices (S), and time-phase characteristics (D). Therefore, we can improve the winter wheat mapping accuracy of the three regional types by improving the spectral resolution, constructing effective spectral indices, and enriching vegetation information. The results of this paper can help effectively construct feature sets using the random forest algorithm, thus simplifying the feature construction workload and ensuring high-precision extraction results in future winter wheat mapping research.

TI  - Systems Thinking and indigenous systems: native contributions to obesity prevention
T2  - ALTERNATIVE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Much has been written about the impact of chronic conditions on post-colonial indigenous populations. Much less, however, has been written about indigenous knowledge and how it may help tackle poor health statistics among indigenous populations. This article describes two approaches to obesity prevention that are grounded in Matauranga Maori (Maori worldview), both of which challenge the "person-centred" approach so prevalent in Western approaches. These approaches were mapped using Systems Thinking tools, specifically causal loop diagrams, to test whether or not these tools could be used to "translate" indigenous approaches in a way that retained the integrity of their particular worldview and provided a tool to help those communities reflect on their practices in a way that led to new insights. Systems Thinking was found to have many overlaps with Matauranga Maori, and the use of system thinking tools provided mutually beneficial learning opportunities for both the researchers and the communities involved.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Contextual Uncertainties in Green Space Exposure Measures: Exploring a Time Series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental health studies on green space may be affected by contextual uncertainties originating from the temporality of environmental exposures and by how the spatial context is delimitated. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is frequently used as an outdoor green space metric capturing the chlorophyll content in the vegetation canopy. This study assessed (1) whether residential NDVI exposures vary over time, and (2) how these time series of NDVI scores vary across spatial context delimitations. Multi-temporal NDVI data for the period 2006-2017 for the Netherlands were obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite platform. Annual NDVI exposures were determined across multiple buffer sizes (i.e., 300, 600, and 1000 m) centered on a random sample of 10,000 Dutch residential addresses. Besides the descriptive statistics, pairwise Wilcoxon tests and Fligner-Killeen tests were used to determine mean and variance differences in annual NDVI scores across buffer widths. Heat maps visualized the correlation matrices. Significance levels were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing. The results indicated that annual NDVI metrics were significantly correlated but their magnitude varied notably between 0.60 to 0.97. Numerous mean and variance differences in annual NDVI exposures were significant. It seems that the disparate buffers (i.e., 300 and 1000 m) were less strongly correlated, possibly because variance heterogeneity is reduced in larger buffers. These results have been largely consistent over the years and have passed Monte Carlo-based sensitivity tests. In conclusion, besides assessing green space exposures along different buffer sizes, our findings suggest that green space-health studies should employ NDVI data that are well-aligned with epidemiological data. Even an annual temporal incompatibility may obscure or distort green space-health associations. Both strategies may diminish contextual uncertainties in environmental exposure assessments.

TI  - Wrong-Patient Blood Transfusion Error: Leveraging Technology to Overcome Human Error in Intraoperative Blood Component Administration
T2  - JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Confirmation of match between patient and blood product remains a manual process in most operating rooms (ORs), and documentation of dual-signature verification remains paper based in most medical institutions. A sentinel event at Johns Hopkins Hospital in which a seriously ill patient undergoing an emergent surgical procedure was transfused with a unit of incompatible red blood cells that had been intended for another patient in an adjacent OR led the hospital to conduct a quality improvement project to improve the safety of intraoperative blood component transfusions.Methods: A multidisciplinary quality improvement project team led a four-phase implementation of bedside bar code transfusion verification (BBTV) for intraoperative blood product administration. Manual random sample audits of blood component transfusions were used to examine accuracy of documentation from July 2014 through June 2016. After the transition to the Epic anesthesia information management system (AIMS) in July 2016, automated Epic reports were generated to provide population-level audits.Results: After initiation of BBTV and the addition of Epic AIMS, compliance with obtaining three metrics on documentation of patient identification (two electronic signatures, start and stop times of transfusion, and blood volume transfused) was improved during a one-year period to > 96%. Pre-Epic audits had shown a mean compliance of only 86%, mainly reflecting a lack of paper blood component requisitions.Conclusion: By implementing BBTV and using a novel intraoperative documentation process within the Epic AIMS, a safer process of blood transfusion in the ORs was initiated and documentation improved.

TI  - Impact of time on interpretations of forest fragmentation: Three-decades of fragmentation dynamics over Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Measures of forest fragmentation, and how fragmentation is changing through time, offer required information for understanding the status and dynamics of forest ecosystems, habitat conditions, and ecosystem functions. In this research, we investigate the multi-temporal characterization of forest fragmentation across the forested ecosystems of Canada (> 650 million ha) and characterize the past three decades of forest fragmentation, providing useful context against which future analyses can be compared. Using 33 years of annual land cover maps produced from classified Landsat image best-available pixel composites (1984-2016), we describe and quantify the different forest patterns and dynamics that emerged in areas that were not disturbed in the analysis period, as well as following stand-replacing (i.e., wildfire, harvest) and non-stand-replacing (e.g., insects, water stress) disturbances. Baseline levels of fragmentation for each ecozone were determined by analyzing unchanged areas. Fragmentation dynamics by dominant forest disturbance showed that harvest activities generally lead to an increase in fragmentation related to the amount of forest cover (composition), while wildfires result in increasing fragmentation as a function of the spatial arrangement of the forest. The results presented herein also allow for characterization of the recovery of vegetation spatial patterns following various disturbance types, with areas dominated by fire presenting slower spatial recovery rates compared to harvest. By the end of the analysis period following disturbance events, forest fragmentation metrics in harvest-dominated landscapes were comparable to the pre-harvesting baseline, reaching 96% of mean pre-disturbance levels for mean forest patch size, and 83% for number of forest patches. In contrast, fire-dominated landscapes resulted in more event related fragmentation, with reduced forest cover (mean Thiel Sen slope = -0.13% year(-1)), mean forest patch size (-0.22 ha year(-1)), an increase in forest patches (0.11 year(-1)), and forest-non-forest join counts (0.83 year(-1)). By the end of the analysis period following disturbance events, mean forest patch size reached 96% of mean pre-disturbance levels and 68% the number of forest patches. Overall, non-stand replacing changes had no impact on the behaviour of the forest fragmentation metrics. The open access to Landsat's image archive combined with the analysis methods presented herein enable the systematic quantification and characterization of Canada-wide trends in forest fragmentation trends and post-disturbance spatial patterns over three decades. The results reported herein provide detailed information on the temporal evolution of spatial forest patterns, and illustrate that given an adequate time period, spatial patterns in areas where land use has not changed, recover to resemble pre-disturbance conditions.

TI  - The Detection and Characterization of Arctic Sea Ice Leads with Satellite Imagers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice leads (fractures) play a critical role in the exchange of mass and energy between the ocean and atmosphere in the polar regions. The thinning of Arctic sea ice over the last few decades will likely result in changes in lead distributions, so monitoring their characteristics is increasingly important. Here we present a methodology to detect and characterize sea ice leads using satellite imager thermal infrared window channels. A thermal contrast method is first used to identify possible sea ice lead pixels, then a number of geometric and image analysis tests are applied to build a subset of positively identified leads. Finally, characteristics such as width, length and orientation are derived. This methodology is applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations for the months of January through April over the period of 2003 to 2018. The algorithm results are compared to other satellite estimates of lead distribution. Lead coverage maps and statistics over the Arctic illustrate spatial and temporal lead patterns.

TI  - Using radiative transfer models in order to estimate PM10 concentration in south of Iran using MODIS images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric particulate matters are the substances that are suspended in the atmosphere and consist of liquid and solid complex mixture. In recent decades, there have been a number of studies that focuses on the methods of estimation of PM10 concentrations using satellite images. Most of these modes use an index from those images, for example aerosol optical depth with a combination of meteorological parameters such as temperature and relative humidity. The main aim of this study is to use a satellite image index, extracted from MODIS images, in order to model PM10 concentration in Khuzestan province, Iran. In this study, a new index, aerosol reflectance, calculated from radiative transfer models is used beside some meteorological parameters. In order to model PM10 concentration, a regression-based mode and two artificial neural networks including multilayer perceptron as a feed-forward model and a radial basis function network are used. Results indicate that there is a correlation value of 0.432 between aerosol reflectance in band 3 (555nm) and PM10 values. After comparing the models in order to predict PM10 concentration, a value of R-2=0.765, with a root mean value of 79.01 is calculated for multilayer perceptron model which shows that multilayer perceptron networks results higher accuracy than others.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility assessment at the Wuning area, China: a comparison between multi-criteria decision making, bivariate statistical and machine learning methods
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research is to investigate multi-criteria decision making [spatial multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE)], bivariate statistical methods [frequency ratio (FR), index of entropy (IOE), weighted linear combination (WLC)] and machine learning [support vector machine (SVM)] models for estimating landslide susceptibility at the Wuning area, China. A total of 445 landslides were randomly classified into 70% (311 landslides) and 30% (134 landslides) to train and validate landslide models, respectively. Fourteen landslide conditioning factors including slope angle, slope aspect, altitude, topographic wetness index, stream power index, sediment transport index, soil, lithology, NDVI, land use, rainfall, distance to road, distance to river and distance to fault were then studied for landslide susceptibility assessment. Performances of five studied models were evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for training (success rate curve) and validation (prediction rate curve) datasets, statistical-based measures and tests. Results indicated that the area under the success rate curve for the FR, IOE, WLC, SVM and SMCE models was 88.32%, 82.58%, 78.91%, 85.47% and 89.96%, respectively, demonstrating that SMCE could provide the higher accuracy. The prediction capability findings revealed that the SMCE model (AUC=86.81%) was also the highest approach among the five studied models, followed by the FR (AUC=84.53%), the SVM (AUC=81.24%), the IOE (AUC=79.67%) and WLC (73.92%) methods. The landslide susceptibility maps derived from the above five models are reasonably accurate and could be used to perform elementary land use planning for hazard extenuation.

Outcomes reported using descriptive statistics.Results A total of 21 events were included involving 21 patients. Mean age was 56.7 years (SD 24.4), 71.4% were above 50 years of age. In 81.8%, the care was multi-disciplinary and in 76.2% the event resulted in permanent harm or injury. Of the 132 identified contributory root causes, most were related to human factors (53.8%) and organisational factors (40.2%). Technical and patient-related factors were identified in 3.0%. Organisational improvement strategies focused on the care of elderly patients, patients subjected to multi-disciplinary care and on improving knowledge, protocols and coordination of care.Conclusion Clustering variables of SEs and contributory factors of failure through RCA helps to delineate a hospital-specific profile by providing a detailed insight into risk factors, patterns and trends in an organisation and to determine the best strategies for improvement by drawing lessons across events.

TI  - Classic chronic pancreatitis is associated with prior acute pancreatitis in only 50% of patients in a large single-institution study
T2  - PANCREATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The sentinel acute pancreatitis event (SAPE) hypothesis for pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis (CP) postulates that acute pancreatitis (AP), especially recurrent AP (RAP), precedes development of CP. However, in a recent population-based study, 52/89 (58.4%) of CP had no prior episodes of AP. In a large clinic-based CP cohort, we aimed to determine the incidence and timing of prior AP in patients diagnosed with CP.Methods: We retrospectively identified 499 consecutive patients with classic CP diagnosed at our institution from January 2013 through December 2015. We abstracted their demographic and clinical data, especially regarding prior AP.Results: We identified 3 cohorts: 1) CP with no AP (n = 231 [46.3%]), 2) AP before CP (n = 250 [50.1%]), and 3) AP after CP (n = 18 [3.6%]). At CP diagnosis, 249 patients (49.9%) had no prior AP. Compared with the "CP preceded by AP" cohort, the "CP without AP"' cohort was older (59.2 +/- 13.9 vs 48.6 +/- 15.7 years; P < .001), had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (30.3% vs 12.4%; P < .001), reported less pain (52.8% vs 87.6%; P < .001), and had a lower rate of endoscopic interventions (16.0% vs 39.2%; P < .001).Conclusion: Nearly half the patients with classic CP did not have prior AP. Only a quarter of patients had CP that could potentially have evolved from prior RAP. Development of CP may be attributable to an altogether different pathogenesis (a non-SAPE pathway) for a considerable proportion of patients. (C) 2019 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article sketches a transdisciplinary theoretical framework for understanding the so-called Anthropocene in terms of global inequalities. The concept of the Anthropocene has several profound implications that challenge central aspects of the modern worldview. Its relation to issues of global justice requires a cataclysmic reconceptualization of conventional notions of development, economic growth, and technological progress. The article refers to the asymmetric global flows of resources that were a prerequisite to the British Industrial Revolution to illustrate how technological systems and so-called energy transitions are not just politically innocent revelations of nature, but thoroughly societal strategies of appropriation. Contemporary observations regarding environmental justice, climate justice, and energy justice can be theorized in terms of the modern inclination to think of the economy as detached from nature, and of technology as detached from world society.

TI  - Improving Satellite Global Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Data Products Through Algorithm Refinement and Data Recovery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - A recently developed algorithm to estimate surface ocean chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl in mg m(-3)), namely, the ocean color index (OCI) algorithm, has been adopted by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration to apply to all satellite ocean color sensors to produce global Chl maps. The algorithm is a hybrid between a band-difference color index algorithm for low-Chl waters and the traditional band-ratio algorithms (OCx) for higher-Chl waters. In this study, the OCI algorithm is revisited for its algorithm coefficients and for its algorithm transition between color index and OCx using a merged data set of high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorometric Chl. Results suggest that the new OCI algorithm (OCI2) leads to lower Chl estimates than the original OCI (OCI1) for Chl<0.05mg m(-3), but smoother algorithm transition for Chl between 0.25 and 0.40mg m(-3). Evaluation using in situ data suggests that similar to OCI1, OCI2 has significantly improved image quality and cross-sensor consistency between SeaWiFS, MODISA, and VIIRS over the OCx algorithms for oligotrophic oceans. Mean cross-sensor difference in monthly Chl data products over global oligotrophic oceans reduced from similar to 10% for OCx to 1-2% for OCI2. More importantly, data statistics suggest that the current straylight masking scheme used to generate global Chl maps can be relaxed from 7x5 to 3x3 pixels without losing data quality in either Chl or spectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda), sr(-1)) for not just oligotrophic oceans but also more productive waters. Such a relaxed masking scheme yields an average relative increase of 39% in data quantity for global oceans, thus making it possible to reduce data product uncertainties and fill data gaps.Plain Language Summary There are generally two issues with any remote sensing data product: data quality (accuracy) and data quantity (coverage). In this work, these two issues for global ocean data products of chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl in mg m(-3)) are investigated through revisiting a recently developed algorithm concept and statistical analyses of cloud-adjacent data. The use of more data in algorithm development leads to slightly different algorithm coefficients and smoother transition between clear and turbid waters, and a new straylight masking scheme is proposed to recover some of the previously masked data in the global data products. The new algorithm leads to significantly improved cross-sensor consistency (SeaWiFS, MODIS, VIIRS) as compared to the traditional band-ratio algorithms, with mean monthly difference reduced from 10% to 1-2%. The new straylight masking scheme leads to relative increase of 39% in data quantity in the global ocean without losing data quality. These improvements are expected to reduce uncertainties and fill gaps in the global data products.

TI  - Spatial variability of urban climate in response to quantitative trait of land cover based on GWR model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature and moisture are central components of the Earth's surface heat budget. China has experienced substantial land use/cover change that has led to deterioration of the urban microclimate, thus affecting global climate change. Understanding the spatial non-stationarity in the relationships between climate and land cover across a highly heterogeneous surface of urban landscapes is important for improving urban planning and management. This study used Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS data to explore the relationship of the three components (index-based built-up index (IBI); bare soil index (SI); and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) with the urban climate (land surface temperature (LST) and land surface moisture (LSM)) using both a global model (ordinary least squares (OLS)) and a local model (geographically weighted regression (GWR)) for a megacity in Southeast China. The global regression results showed that there were significant positive correlations between the LST and the IBI and SI, while significant negative correlations were observed between the LST and the NDVI; opposite results were observed for the LSM. The IBI is the factor having the greatest impact on the LST, while the SI is among the most important factors for the LSM. The local regression results showed that the response of urban climate to land surface is affected greatly by water areas, but the role of the water areas is impacted by their size and surrounding landscape patterns. Moreover, the effects of vegetation and built-up land on the urban climate vary across locations with different wind patterns.

M3  - Article
AB  - Limited research has been published on land changes and their driving mechanisms in Central Asia, but this area is an important ecologically sensitive area. Supported by Google Earth Engine (GEE), this study used Landsat satellite imagery and selected the random forest algorithm to perform land classification and obtain the annual land cover datasets of Central Asia from 2001 to 2017. Based on the temporal datasets, the distributions and dynamic trends of land cover were summarized, and the key factors driving land changes were analyzed. The results show that (1) the obtained land datasets are reliable and highly accurate, with an overall accuracy of 0.90 +/- 0.01. (2) Grassland and bareland are the two most prominent land cover types, with area proportions of 45.0% and 32.9% in 2017, respectively. Over the past 17 years, bareland has displayed an overall reduction, decreasing by 2.6% overall. Natural vegetation (grassland, forest, and shrubland), cultivated land, water bodies and wetlands have displayed increasing trends at different rates. (3) The amount of precipitation and degree of drought are the driving factors that affect natural vegetation. The changes in cultivated land are mainly affected by precipitation and anthropogenic drivers. The effects of increasing urban populations and expanding industrial development are the factors driving the expansion of urban regions. The advantages and uncertainties arising from the land mapping and change detection method and the complexity of the driving mechanisms are also discussed.

TI  - Refocusing Moving Ship Targets in SAR Images Based on Fast Minimum Entropy Phase Compensation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Moving ship targets appear blurred and defocused in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images due to the translation motion during the coherent processing. Motion compensation is required for refocusing moving ship targets in SAR scenes. A novel refocusing method for moving ship is developed in this paper. The method is exploiting inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) technique to refocus the ship target in SAR image. Generally, most cases of refocusing are for raw echo data, not for SAR image. Taking into account the advantages of processing in SAR image, the processing data are SAR image rather than raw echo data in this paper. The ISAR processing is based on fast minimum entropy phase compensation method, an iterative approach to obtain the phase error. The proposed method has been tested using Spaceborne TerraSAR-X, Gaofeng-3 images and airborne SAR images of maritime targets.

TI  - The Geomorphology, Structure, and Lava Flow Dynamics of Peralkaline Rift Volcanoes From High-Resolution Digital Elevation Models
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed topographic data from volcanoes can yield key insights into the controls on volcanic activity as well as hazards. High-resolution digital elevation models generated from remote sensing data enable comparison of the geomorphology and structure of large and inaccessible volcanoes. We present new topographic data for three peralkaline volcanoes in the Main Ethiopian Rift (Fentale, Corbetti, and Gedemsa) and one volcano in the Afar Rift (Dabbahu), combined with field observations, reveal previously unidentified post-caldera deposits and craters. Vent and crater locations are aligned with rift-parallel faults and also with rift-cutting structures in a variety of orientations. Caldera shape is controlled by interaction with these structures. The relative frequency and type of eruption varies greatly between these volcanoes over the past 150 kyr. Gedemsa is now largely inactive; Fentale hosts deposits from many small volume eruptions (< 0.1 km(3)); while Corbetti has produced several large eruptions (similar to 0.4-0.5 km(3)). Morphometry of peralkaline rhyolite deposits at Corbetti and Fentale, including ogives and levees, provides constraints on rheology. Emplacement viscosities of similar to 10(8)-10(11) Pas at Fentale are similar to or lower than calc-alkaline rhyolites and consistent with experimental and theoretical studies. The observations presented here have significant implications for hazard assessment in the Ethiopian rift and highlight the importance of structural features in controlling the location, magnitude, and style of volcanic activity in the Main Ethiopian Rift.Plain Language Summary We created high-resolution topographic maps using images captured from space, or from aircraft, to investigate four Ethiopian volcanoes, which are large and in some cases inaccessible presenting challenges to studying them. These volcanoes are located in the Great Rift Valley, where the continent of Africa is splitting in two. We have identified deposits from previous eruptions, calculating their size and comparing typical eruptions for each volcano. At some volcanoes, the locations for each eruption line up parallel to fractures in the Earth's surface. In other places, locations line up with older faults that are now buried. The shapes of large craters have also been controlled by faults. The shapes of cooled lava flows suggest that the lava at Fentale may have been more fluid than typical lavas, owing to the unusual composition of lava found at rifts. Our study highlights key questions about volcanoes in rifts. We provide important observations for the assessment of future hazards at each volcano, located among a growing population and vulnerable infrastructure.

TI  - Application of cloud multi-spectral radiances in revealing cloud physical structures
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The radiances scattered or emitted by clouds demonstrate diverse features at different wavelengths due to different cloud physical structures. This paper presents a method (the smallest-radiance-distance method, SRaDM) of revealing the physical structures of clouds. The method is based on multi-spectral radiances measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua. The principle and methodology of SRaDM is deduced and provided in this paper. Correlation analysis based on data from MODIS and Cloud Profiling Radar (onboard CloudSat), collected from January 2007 to December 2010 over an ocean area (15 degrees N-45 degrees N, 145 degrees E-165 degrees E), led to selection of radiances at 13 wavebands of MODIS that demonstrated high sensitivity to cloud physical structures; radiances at the selected wavebands were subjected to SRaDM. The Standardized Euclidean distance is introduced to quantify the degree of changes in multi-spectral radiances (termed D-rd) and in physical structures (termed D-st) between cloud profiles. Statistics based on numerous cloud profiles show that D-rd decreases monotonically with a decrease in D-st, which implies that small D-rd always accompanies small D-st. According to the law of D-rd and D-st, the new method, SRaDM, for revealing physical structures of clouds from the collocation of cloud profiles of similar multi-spectral radiances, is presented. Then, two successful experiments are presented in which cloud physical structures are captured using multi-spectral radiances. SRaDM provides a way to obtain knowledge of the physical structures of clouds over relatively larger areas, and is a new approach to obtaining 3D cloud fields.

TI  - Object-Based Classification of Forest Disturbance Types in the Conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems provide critical ecosystem goods and services, and any disturbance-induced changes can have cascading impacts on natural processes and human socioeconomic systems. Forest disturbance frequency, intensity, and spatial and temporal scale can be altered by changes in climate and human activity, but without baseline forest disturbance data, it is impossible to quantify the magnitude and extent of these changes. Methodologies for quantifying forest cover change have been developed at the regional-to-global scale via several approaches that utilize data from high (e.g., IKONOS, Quickbird), moderate (e.g., Landsat) and coarse (e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) spatial resolution satellite imagery. While detection and quantification of forest cover change is an important first step, attribution of disturbance type is critical missing information for establishing baseline data and effective land management policy. The objective here was to prototype and test a semi-automated methodology for characterizing high-magnitude (>50% forest cover loss) forest disturbance agents (stress, fire, stem removal) across the conterminous United States (CONUS) from 2003-2011 using the existing University of Maryland Landsat-based Global Forest Change Product and Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD). The Forest Cover Change maps were segmented into objects based on temporal and spatial adjacency, and object-level spectral metrics were calculated based on WELD reflectance time series. A training set of objects with known disturbance type was developed via high-resolution imagery and expert interpretation, ingested into a Random Forest classifier, which was then used to attribute disturbance type to all 15,179,430 forest loss objects across CONUS. Accuracy assessments of the resulting classification was conducted with an independent dataset consisting of 4156 forest loss objects. Overall accuracy was 88.1%, with the highest omission and commission errors observed for fire (32.8%) and stress (31.9%) disturbances, respectively. Of the total 172,686 km(2) of forest loss, 83.75% was attributed to stem removal, 10.92% to fire and 5.33% to stress. The semi-automated approach described in this paper provides a promising framework for the systematic characterization and monitoring of forest disturbance regimes.

TI  - The impact of mandatory iodine fortification and supplementation on pregnant and lactating women in Australia
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objectives: In Australia, two public health measures were introduced between 2009 and 2010 to reduce iodine deficiency. However there has been a shortage of information regarding their effectiveness and the ongoing prevalence of iodine deficiency in Australia. The primary aim of this study was to assess the extent to which these public health measures have reduced rates of iodine deficiency among pregnant and lactating women. Methods and Study Design: A review was conducted to identify all studies published since January 2010 that quantitatively measured the iodine status of pregnant and/or lactating women in Australia. Results: We found 25 publications, of which seven were included in this review after our exclusion criteria were applied. Of the seven included publications, three demonstrated the pregnant and lactating women in their studies to be iodine replete (median urinary iodine concentrations (MUIC) greater than 150 mu g/L, or a breast milk iodine concentration (BMIC) of greater than 100 mu g/L). The remaining four publications found MUIC of pregnant and lactating women to be below the 150 mu g/L threshold, in the mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency category. Only two studies, documented iodine sufficiency among pregnant and lactating women in the absence of iodine supplementation. Conclusions: Many pregnant and lactating women in Australia remain at least mildly iodine deficient. Antenatal iodine supplementation was the factor most consistently associated with an adequate iodine status. Larger, more representative studies or sentinel studies with a National coordination are needed to understand the differences in iodine status that exist across the country.

TI  - Mosaicking Opportunistically Acquired Very High-Resolution Helicopter-Borne Images over Drifting Sea Ice Using COTS Sensors
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observing sea ice by very high-resolution (VHR) images not only improves the quality of lower-resolution remote sensing products (e.g., sea ice concentration, distribution of melt ponds and pressure ridges, sea ice surface roughness, etc.) by providing details on the ground truth of sea ice, but also assists sea ice fieldwork. In this study, two fieldwork-based methods are proposed, one for the practical acquisition of VHR images over drifting Arctic sea ice using low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors equipped on a helicopter, and the other for quantifying the compensating effect from continuously drifting sea ice that reduces geolocation uncertainty in the image mosaicking procedure. The drifting trajectory of the target ice was yielded from that recorded by an icebreaker that was tightly anchored to the floe and was then used to reversely compensate the locations of acquired VHR images. After applying the compensation, three-dimensional geolocation errors of the VHR images were decreased by 79.3% and 24.2% for two pre-defined image groups, respectively. The enhanced accuracy of the imaging locations was affected by imaging duration causing variable drifting distances of individual images. Further applicability of the mosaicked VHR image was discussed by comparing it with a TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture radar image containing the target ice, suggesting that the proposed methods can be used for precise comparison with satellite remote sensing products.

TI  - Environmental and Spatial Assessment of Urban Heat Islands in Qalyubia Governorate, Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is the first attempt to map Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) and assess the associated environmental characteristics in Qalyubia Governorate using remote sensing and GIS integrated with a field survey. A calibrated Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) acquired on July 22, 2018 was processed to calculate Land Surface Temperature (LST) and UHIs as well as to evaluate the environmental conditions through calculating the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and the spectral retrieved indices. The investigated indices include Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI) and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). Likewise, multispectral algorithm model was applied on the landsat calibrated image for mapping Particulate Matter of diameters lower than 10 micrometer (PM10) and characterizing its levels in the UHIs. The results demonstrated that the mean LST of each LULC class in Qalyubia Governorate followed this order; bare lands > urban > vegetation > water bodies. Most of bare land and built-up areas exist as heat island regions. The total area of UHIs was 397.5 km(2); 119.8 km(2) as bare land (30.2%), 201.2 km(2) as built-up (50.6%), 0.2 km(2) as water (0.05%) and 76.3 km(2) as vegetation (19.2%). Low mean values of NDVI and MNDWI were observed in association with UHIs regions which confirmed the positive impact of green cover and water bodies in eliminating UHIs phenomena. On other hand, NDBI showed high mean level in UHIs comparing to its levels in the study area. The average value of PM10 over UHI (94.26 mu g/m(3)) was more than that in the study area (81.07 mu g/m(3)). It can be concluded that the decrease in green spaces and water bodies as well as the increase in urban density lead to increasing the intensity and widespread of UHIs phenomenon. Therefore, the study recommends the necessity to consider results of the present study for urban designers, planners, and architects in designing and planning urban communities.

TI  - DuPLO: A DUal view Point deep Learning architecture for time series classificatiOn
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, modem Earth Observation systems continuously generate huge amounts of data. A notable example is represented by the Sentinel-2 mission, which provides images at high spatial resolution (up to 10 m) with high temporal revisit period (every 5 days), which can be organized in Satellite Image Time Series (SITS). While the use of SITS has been proved to be beneficial in the context of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) map generation, unfortunately, most of machine learning approaches commonly leveraged in remote sensing field fail to take advantage of spatio-temporal dependencies present in such data.Recently, new generation deep learning methods allowed to significantly advance research in this field. These approaches have generally focused on a single type of neural network, i.e., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which model different but complementary information: spatial autocorrelation (CNNs) and temporal dependencies (RNNs). In this work, we propose the first deep learning architecture for the analysis of SITS data, namely DuPLO (DUal view Point deep Learning architecture for time series classificatiOn), that combines Convolutional and Recurrent neural networks to exploit their complementarity. Our hypothesis is that, since CNNs and RNNs capture different aspects of the data, a combination of both models would produce a more diverse and complete representation of the information for the underlying land cover classification task. Experiments carried out on two study sites characterized by different land cover characteristics (i.e., the Gard site in Mainland France and Reunion Island, a overseas department of France in the Indian Ocean), demonstrate the significance of our proposal.

AB  - Objective: Despite its relative high frequency; the recurrence, metastasis and long-term survival rates of hand squamous cell carcinoma have not been well defined. The aim of this study was to review a large cohort of patients with hand squamous cell carcinomas and to evaluate the management techniques, outcomes of treatment modalities and survival rates.Methods: A retrospective review of all surgically excised primary squamous cell carcinoma of the hand operated between 2006 and 2011 was included in this multicenter study. Patients were evaluated regarding age, anatomic location of the tumor, gender, treatment modality, survival, and recurrence rate. In addition, recurrence and survival rates were also categorized according to the tumor size.Results: A total of 129 patients were evaluated. Tumors smaller than 2 cm had a recurrence rate of 9.7% and a metastatic rate of 6.5%; tumors larger than 2 cm had a recurrence rate of 16.7% and a metastatic rate of 33% during 5-year follow-ups.Conclusion: In contrast to squamous cell carcinoma of the face, those occurring on the hand are malignancies with a worse clinical course, greater tendency for recurrence, metastatic spread, and functional deficiency which might require amputation and complex soft tissue reconstruction.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Variations in Atmospheric Water Vapour Content over Nigeria from GNSS Measurements
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyses the meteorological impact of the variability of precipitable water vapour (PWV) retrieved from ground-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) stations over Nigeria from 2013 to 2014; these measurements represent the foremost probe of GNSS PWV distribution and variability over Nigeria. In this study, GNSS PWV daily estimates were grouped into monthly and seasonal averages; the variations in the monthly and seasonal estimates of GNSS PWV were characterized and correlated with different weather events that are regarded as good climate change indicators. The results revealed that the spatiotemporal changes in PWV content are largely subjugated by the effects of latitude, topographical features, the seasons and the continental air masses. Our study shows that there is a very strong seasonal interplay among the GNSS PWV, relative humidity, rainfall and cloud estimates. In addition, GNSS PWV and total electron content (TEC) estimates show an opposite relationship; the semi-diurnal relationship between GNSS PWV and TEC is stronger than the seasonal relationship. The seasonal relation among GNSS PWV, temperature and wind speed appears weak, while very strong interplay exists among the GNSS PWV, sun spot number and total solar radiation estimates. Our results confirm that GNSS PWV is a good pointer for weather forecasting/monitoring and fit for climate monitoring if available on a longer time scale. Finally, we recommend the densification of the GNSS network in Nigeria, as this will enable 3D profiling of PWV, thereby providing more information on GNSS PWV time series, which is needed for long-term climatology.

TI  - SEMANTIC FIELD AS A REFLECTION OF LINGUISTIC WORLDVIEW (AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE FIELD "REINDEER" IN THE KILDIN SAAMI LANGUAGE)
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article aims to present the semantic field "Reindeer" in the Kildin Saami language. This study is based on the hypothesis about unique anthropocentricity of such an endangered Finno-Ugric language as Saami and its close connection with prelogical thinking, which is associated with the original presentation of people as a part of nature in the Saami culture. The material is analyzed according to the "Nature - Human being" thesaurus scheme. The authors have proved that the allocation of meanings and formation of a separate word are directly related to the importance of any given object, attribute or action for practical human activities in the Kildin Saami language. One of the study objectives is to compare the semantic field in languages of indigenous minorities living in Northern Russia using available lexicographical sources. A comparative analysis has demonstrated that the Kildin Saami language has less color-related nominations of reindeer than languages of other northern peoples engaged in reindeer herding. The semantic field in the language of northern indigenous peoples is specific due to particular relationships of this ethnos with nature. The analysis of opposing relationships in the semantic filed "Reindeer" in the Kildin Saami language reveals some lexical gaps and enables to determine a set of differential features. The material under study presents such types of oppositions as equipollent, privative and gradual.

TI  - Iris varix: 10-year experience with 28 eyes
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics, multimodality imaging findings, and clinical course of iris varices. Methods: Retrospective, noncomparative, observational case series of 28 eyes of 26 patients with iris varices, diagnosed between 2007 and 2017, has been used. Results: The mean (+/- SD) age was 58.3 +/- 12.5 years (median 57.5, range 37-81). Patients were 57.7% male and 27% hypertensive. Varices were bilateral in two patients. The mean and median visual acuities were both 20/20 (range 20/16-20/40). Intraocular pressures were 16 mmHg (10-23 mmHg). Secondary glaucoma did not occur. The inferotemporal iris quadrant was affected in 75%. A single varix was seen in 64% and 36% appeared multiple. Varix orientation was radial in 57% and circumferential in 21%. Combined radial and circumferential varix orientation was noted in 18%. One had independent radial and circumferential varices in separate quadrants. A single episcleral sentinel blood vessel directed to the varix was present in 36%. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) showed a slightly increased mean iris thickness of 0.8 mm and multiple echolucent iris stromal vascular channels. Iris angiography showed no leakage of dye. Managed by observation over a mean follow-up of 37.7 months (range, 3-129), 96.4% eyes were stable and one (3.6%) regressed. No corectopia, ectropion uveae, hyphema, or metachronous anterior segment benign or malignant tumors occurred. Conclusion: Iris varix is primarily located in the inferotemporal quadrant and not associated with dysmorphic pupillary findings, progression, secondary glaucoma, or malignancy. Iris varices were benign vasculopathies with no associated ocular or vision-related morbidity.

TI  - Observational approach on regional lymph node in cutaneous melanomas of extremities
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: We evaluated failure pattern and treatment outcomes of observational approach on regional lymph node (LN) in cutaneous melanoma of extremities and sought to find clinico-pathologic factors related to LN metastases.Material and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 73 patients with cutaneous melanoma of extremities between 2005 and 2016. If preoperative 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) findings were non-specific for regional LNs, surgical resection of primary tumors with adequate margins was performed without sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and/or complete lymph node dissection (CLND), irrespective of tumor thickness or size. In patients with suspicious or positive findings on PET/CT or CT, SLNB followed by CLND or CLND was performed at the discretion of the surgeon. We defined LN dissection (LND) as SLNB and/or CLND.Results: With a median follow-up of 38 months (range, 6 to 138 months), the dominant pattern of failure was regional failure (17 of total 23 events, 74%) in the observation group (n = 56). Pathologic LN metastases were significant factor for poor regional failure-free survival (hazard ration [HR] = 3.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-10.33; p = 0.044) and overall survival (HR = 3.62; 95% CI, 1.02-12.94; p = 0.047) in multivariate analysis. In subgroup analysis for cN0 patients according to the preoperative PET/CT findings, LND group showed the better trend of LRFFS (log rank test, p = 0.192) and RFFS (p = 0.310), although which is not statistically significant.Conclusion: Observational approach on regional LNs on the basis of the PET/CT in patients with cutaneous melanoma of extremities showed the dominant regional failure pattern compared to upfront LND approach. To reveal regional lymph node status, SLND for cN0 patients may of importance in managing cutaneous melanoma patients.

TI  - Seasonal microclimatic variation in a succession gradient of low thorn forest in Northeastern Mexico
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Global increase in land cover change and deforestation bring about fragmentation of a high proportion of native vegetation areas. Microclimate is among the first modified factors after vegetation loss, effects of such disturbances are critical for species performance. However, both secondary succession and seasonality provoke further modifications in abiotic environment after disturbances. Although microclimate patterns during succession are well studied for several ecosystems, they are practically unknown for low thorn forests. In Northern Mexico, this is an endangered ecosystem characterized by harboring a high percentage of endemics. Measurement of microclimatic factors is crucial for understanding possible consequences of post-disturbance time on species inhabiting this ecosystem. This work aimed to assess seasonal variation of microclimatic patterns in a succession gradient of four categories (conserved areas, 31, 17 and four years of succession). The study area was delimited using Landsat satellite images (1973, 1986, 2000, 2005, and 2013) in a fragment of low thorn forest in Northeastern Mexico. For microclimate characterization we studied wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, heat index, dew point, and evapotranspiration. Variables were measured monthly on eight plots, in each of the four successional categories, during two different seasons: wet (May through October 2016) and dry season (November 2016 through April 2017). A multivariate discriminant function analysis showed that microclimate differs among successional stages. In the wet season, early succession areas were characterized by higher values of heat index and wind speed, contrary to conserved areas. In the dry season, successional differences were attributed to wind speed and relative humidity. Moreover, microclimate differences between categories and importance of variables measured were both higher only during the dry season. Our results show that seasonality influences greatly microclimatic patterns during secondary succession. In addition, each one of the successional categories exhibited unique microclimatic conditions. Remarkably, four, 17, and even 31 years succession categories differed from conserved areas. This work provides evidence on the great relevance of seasonality and microclimate for studying secondary succession. It is suggested to take both factors into consideration when implementing conservation programs concerning endangered habitats such as low thorn forests. As an ecosystem poorly studied, microclimate characterization provided herein, shall help to a better understanding and management of these areas.

TI  - Ship detection in spaceborne infrared images based on Convolutional Neural Networks and synthetic targets
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic detection of ships in spaceborne infrared images is important for both military and civil applications due to its all-weather detection capability. While deep learning methods have made great success in many image processing fields recently, training deep learning models still relies on large amount of labeled data, which may limit its application performance for infrared images target detection tasks. Considering that, we propose a new infrared ship detection method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) which is trained only with synthetic targets. For the problem of limited infrared training data, we design a Transfer Network (T-Net) to generate large amount of synthetic infrared-style ship targets from Google Earth images. The experiments are conducted on a near infrared band image (0.845-0.885 mu m), a short wavelength infrared band image (1.560-1.66 mu m) and a long wavelength infrared band image (2.1-2.3 mu m) of Landsat-8 satellite. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the target generation ability of T-Net. With only synthetic training samples, our detection method achieves a higher accuracy than other classical ship detection methods.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring of eco-environmental quality in arid desert area by remote sensing: Taking the Gurbantunggut Desert China as an example
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remote sensing ecological index ( RSEI) to evaluate regional ecological changes can obtain the ecological environment changes quickly, efficiently, and objectively. In this study, RSEI of four ecological factors, greenness, humidity, heat, and dryness were calculated using the Landsat data and the spatial and temporal patterns of ecological environment in the Gurbantunggut Desert from 2006 to 2017 were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated, based on the weights determined by principal component analysis. The results showed that humidity and greenness played a positive role in the eco-environment quality of the Gurbantunggut Desert, whereas heat and dryness had negative effects. Normalized vegetation index (NDVI) representing the greenness was the top contributor among those four factors. The RSEI of the Gurbantunggut Desert declined from 2006 to 2017, with a 20.1% decrease of the mean value from 0.294 in 2006 to 0.243 in 2017. The ecological environment of the study area showed a deterioration. The eco-environmental quality of the central part of the Gurbantunggut Desert was relatively stable. The eco-environment quality of the dense vegetation areas in the northeast and the irrigated areas in the south was getting better, but that of southern and northwestern parts of the desert was getting worse.

TI  - Sex-biased regulation of respiratory burst, phagocytic activity and plasma immune factors in lined seahorse (<i>Hippocampus erectus</i>) after subchronic benzo[<i>a</i>]pyrene exposure
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Both wild and aquacultured seahorses are currently under great threat from marine pollution, notably from the potent contaminant and carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). However, very little data are available regarding the immunomodulating effects of BaP in seahorses. Therefore, in this study, we exposed lined seahorses (Hippocampus erectus) for 7 d to BaP at three dosages (0.5, 5, and 50 mu g/L) to evaluate sexual dimorphism in immune response. We measured eight immune parameters in the blood, including respiratory burst (RB), phagocytic activity (PA), monocytes/leucocytes, immunoglobulin M, complement 3, complement, interferon-a, and interleukin-2. Male seahorses had significantly higher parameters than females, except in terms of monocytes/leucocytes (P < 0.05). Although flow cytometry showed that RB and PA variation per BaP dose were roughly similar across sexes, RB and PA exhibited distinct patterns. Additionally, fluorescence intensity and leucocyte percentage were positively correlated in PA but not RB for all treatment and sex combinations. Through ELISA, we showed that the other six parameters had complex responses that nevertheless varied in a BaP-dosage and sex-dependent manner. Overall, adult male seahorses had higher immunocompetence than females before BaP exposure, and sexual dimorphism continued to be apparent during BaP exposure. Furthermore, all eight parameters were sensitive to BaP. Based on these results, we highly recommend H. erectus as a sentinel species for crude contamination, whereas PA and RB are valuable bioindicators of marine contaminants such as BaP.

T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study discusses measures for improving the precision of optical remote-sensing detection of soil salinity and the possibility of soil salinity detection at different depths of 0-10cm, 10-30cm and 30-50cm using optical remote-sensing data, and analyzes the mechanism by which deep-layer soil salinity influences the soil spectrum. The findings show that there is a high and significant correlation between soil-spectral reflectance and soil salinity, and that the correlation between soil-spectral reflectance and soil salinity decreases gradually from the blue band to the shortwave infrared band of ETM + images. The partial least squares regression model is used to estimate soil salinity in the 0-10-cm surface-layer, confirming that the selected soil-salinity-detecting bands of Band 1 and Band 4, the established difference soil salinity index, the derivative of the normalized differential vegetation index, and the deep-layer soil moisture can improve the precision of remote-sensing detection of surface-layer soil salinity. The precise estimation of the 0-10-cm surface-layer soil salinity with variables features an R-2=0.752, an RMSE=26.84g/Kg, and a p=0.000. There is a strong mediating effect between deep-layer soil salinity, 0-10-cm surface-layer soil salinity, and soil spectral reflectance in the study area; namely, deep-layer soil salinity influences soil spectral reflectance by influencing surface-layer soil salinity. There is a significant and very strong power function relation between 0 and 10-cm surface-layer soil salinity and deep-layer soil salinity. Based on this relationship, this study estimates deep-layer soil salinity using optical remote-sensing images.

TI  - Unsupervised Oil Tank Detection by Shape-Guide Saliency Model
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, a novel oil tank detection framework based on a shape-guide saliency (SGS) model is proposed. Beyond the low-level visual stimuli, SGS focuses more on simulating the selective visual searching, which is dominated by the goal in human minds. Using a top-down strategy, SGS breaks the limitation of the low-level visual features and introduces the high-level task concept to measure saliency. For the oil tank detection, SGS model skillfully extracts the contour shape cue (CSC) as the target-oriented information and uses CSC to guide the selective saliency value calculation. Specifically, a sparse reconstruction with the target-specific dictionary is implemented to generate the saliency map. This saliency map only assigns high values to oil tank regions instead of highlighting all high-contrast regions. Consequently, SGS model is capable of accurately locating oil tanks and eliminating the interferences of high-contrast backgrounds. Experimental results on a remote sensing data set demonstrate that the proposed SGS model outperforms five class-independent saliency models. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art oil tank detection approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Evaluation of RadCalNet Output Data Using Landsat 7, Landsat 8, Sentinel 2A, and Sentinel 2B Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2013, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV) Infrared and Visible Optical Sensors Subgroup (IVOS) established the Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet), consisting of four international test sites providing automated in situ measurements and estimates of propagated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. This work evaluates the reliability' of RadCalNet TOA reflectance data at three of these sitesRVUS, LCFR, and GONAusing Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI), and Sentinel 2A/2B (S2A/S2B) MSI TOA reflectance data. This work identified a viewing angle effect in the MSI data at the RVUS and LCFR sites; when corrected, the overall standard deviation in relative reflectance differences decreased by approximately 2% and 0.5% at the RVUS and LCFR sites, respectively. Overall, the relative mean differences between the RadCalNet surface data and sensor data for the RVUS and GONA sites are within 5% for ETM+, OLI, and S2A MSI, with an approximately 2% higher difference in the S2B MSI data at the RVUS site. The LCFR site is different from the other two sites, with relative mean differences ranging from approximately -10% to 1%, even after performing the viewing angle effect correction on the MSI data. The data from RadCalNet are easy to acquire and use. More effort is needed to better understand the behavior at LCFR. One significant improvement on the accuracy of the RadCalNet data might be the development of a site-specific BRDF characterization and correction.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to analyze the distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) after breast-conserving therapy (BCT) in older patients with breast cancer in a large, population-based, single-center cohort study with long-term follow-up.Material and Methods: Analyses were based on 1,425 women aged 65 years and older with breast cancer treated with BCT. Patients were divided in three age categories: 65 - 70 years, 71 - 75 years, and >75 years. The study period extended over 30 years, divided in three decades. Multivariate survival analysis was carried out using Cox regression analysis.Results: The two youngest age categories showed significant improvements over time in 12-year DMFS and DSS. For women aged 65 - 70 years, this improvement was noted in stage I and stage II disease, while for women aged 71 - 75 years this was mainly in stage II tumors. Women >75 years of age did not show any improvement over time, regardless of stage.Conclusion: Among older Dutch women with breast cancer, outcomes with regard to DMFS and DSS after BCT differ between various age categories, showing the least gain in the very old.

TI  - Conversations in Context: Cross-Cultural (Grassroots) Biblical Interpretation Groups Challenging Western-centric (Professional) Biblical Interpretation
T2  - BIBLICAL INTERPRETATION-A JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY APPROACHES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article considers how biblical scholarship might break out of its western-dominated, largely historical-critical mould. I argue that we might challenge the hegemony of 'western worldview' scholarship by capitalising on the interpretative insights of alternative worldviews; in that regard, I advance a cross-cultural methodology. Additionally, I advocate engaging with grassroots interpreters, thereby contributing to the decentring of scholarly biblical criticism. Finally, this article focuses on the value of interpretation through dialogue, which functions here on two levels: the researcher dialoguing with grassroots interpretation groups in cross-cultural settings, and the resulting grassroots interpretations dialoguing with western professional biblical interpretations. The potential of this approach is demonstrated using a case study: Mark 4:35-41 interpreted with Cross-Cultural Biblical Interpretation Groups in northern Namibia. The interpretative insights of grassroots groups in non-western contexts, free(r) from the influence of western worldviews and scholarship, function to highlight the equally contextual nature of mainstream professional biblical interpretation.

TI  - Bayesian Dynamic Linear Models for Estimation of Phenological Events from Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the timing of the occurrence of events that characterize growth cycles in vegetation from time series of remote sensing data is desirable for a wide area of applications. For example, the timings of plant life cycle events are very sensitive to weather conditions and are often used to assess the impacts of changes in weather and climate. Likewise, understanding crop phenology can have a large impact on agricultural strategies. To study phenology using remote sensing data, the timings of annual phenological events must be estimated from noisy time series that may have many missing values. Many current state-of-the-art methods consist of smoothing time series and estimating events as features of smoothed curves. A shortcoming of many of these methods is that they do not easily handle missing values and require imputation as a preprocessing step. In addition, while some currently used methods may be extendable to allow for temporal uncertainty quantification, uncertainty intervals are not usually provided with phenological event estimates. We propose methodology utilizing Bayesian dynamic linear models to estimate the timing of key phenological events from remote sensing data with uncertainty intervals. We illustrate the methodology on weekly vegetation index data from 2003 to 2007 over a region of southern India, focusing on estimating the timing of start of season and peak of greenness. Additionally, we present methods utilizing the Bayesian formulation and MCMC simulation of the model to estimate the probability that more than one growing season occurred in a given year. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.

TI  - Observations on the Medicare Value-Based Ranking of Hospitals During Fiscal Years 2015 and 2016
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Medicare's Value-Based Purchasing Program (VBPP) compensates hospitals based on value of care provided. VBPP's total performance score (TPS) components data were evaluated by hospital groups: physician-owned surgical hospitals (POSH), Kaiser Hospitals, University HealthSystem Consortium Hospitals, Pioneer Accountable Care Organization Hospitals, US News and World Report Honor Roll Hospitals, and other hospitals. Multilevel random coefficient models estimated mean and significance of TPS differences from fiscal year (FY) 2015 and FY 2016, by hospital type. Overall mean TPS for 2985 hospitals decreased from 41.65 to 40.25. POSH and Kaiser Hospitals had significantly higher TPS in FY 2015 and FY 2016. POSH Patient Experience Domain scores exceeded all other Patient Experience Domain scores. The Efficiency Domain scores of Kaiser greatly exceeded the scores of all groups. Results suggest that POSH and Kaiser Hospitals provide significantly greater value of care with consistency from year to year when compared with other groups studied.

TI  - Restaging the axilla after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: Predictive factors for residual metastatic lymph node disease with negative imaging findings
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate predictive factors for residual metastatic axillary lymph node (ALN) disease in patients with negative imaging findings after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for breast cancer. From January 2011 to December 2015, 206 patients underwent imaging including ultrasonography, MRI, and PET/CT for restaging the axilla after NAC. Data collected included preoperative information regarding histologic grade, hormone receptor (HR) status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare patients with and without residual metastatic ALN disease among patients who showed negative imaging findings after NAC. Of the 181 and 25 patients with initially node-positive and node-negative disease, 131 (72.4%) and 23 (92.0%), respectively, showed negative imaging findings after NAC. Among these 131 and 23 patients, 53 (40.5%) and two patients (8.7%), respectively, had residual metastatic ALN disease. Low to moderate tumor grade (odds ratio [OR] = 5.2, P = 0.009), positive HR status (OR = 6.6, P = 0.003), and negative HER2 status (OR = 2.6, P = 0.048) were associated with residual metastatic ALN disease. Low to moderate histologic grade, positive HR status, and negative HER2 status may serve as predictors of residual metastatic ALN disease in patients with negative imaging findings after NAC for breast cancer.

TI  - Urban Heat Island Analysis in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An urban heat island (UHI) occurs when a city center is substantially hotter compared to neighbouring countryside. In this study, UHI intensity is assessed using Landsat 8 data in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. An ERDAS Imagine algorithm is used to acquire the land surface temperature (LST) from Landsat 8 data. The association of LST and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as well as the normalized difference build-up index (NDBI) is also assessed. The outcome of the study shows that the influence of UHI in Dar es Salaam is situated mainly in built-up areas compared to the surrounding rural areas. The negative association of LST and NDVI shows that greenery can reduce the development of a UHI, while the positive association of LST and NDBI indicate that built-up areas can enhance the formation of UHI.

TI  - Predicting demographics, moral foundations, and human values from digital behaviours
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Personal electronic devices including smartphones give access to behavioural signals that can be used to learn about the characteristics and preferences of individuals. In this study, we explore the connection between demographic and psychological attributes and the digital behavioural records, for a cohort of 7633 people, closely representative of the US population with respect to gender, age, geographical distribution, education, and income. Along with the demographic data, we collected self-reported assessments on validated psychometric questionnaires for moral traits and basic human values, and combined this information with passively collected multi-modal digital data from web browsing behaviour and smartphone usage. A machine learning framework was then designed to infer both the demographic and psychological attributes from the behavioural data. In a cross-validated setting, our models predicted demographic attributes with good accuracy as measured by the weighted AUROC score (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic), but were less performant for the moral traits and human values. These results call for further investigation, since they are still far from unveiling individual? psychological fabric. This connection, along with the most predictive features that we provide for each attribute, might prove useful for designing personalised services, communication strategies, and interventions, and can be used to sketch a portrait of people with similar worldview.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study uses 18 years (March 2000-May 2017) of satellite-derived relevant parameters to examine the impact of aerosols on cloud properties, radiative fluxes and ACI (aerosol-cloud interaction) over Indian region. The study includes consideration of shortwave cloud radiative forcing (SWCRF), longwave cloud radiative forcing (LWCRF) and net cloud radiative forcing (NetCRF) from CERES (Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System). Also, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud properties such as ice/liquid CER (Cloud Effective Radius), CF (Cloud Fraction), COD (Cloud Optical Depth), CTP (Cloud Top Pressure) and ice/liquid CWP (Cloud Water Path; i.e., ICWP and LCWP) are also considered. Moderate to high aerosol loading and the significant increasing trend of AOD is observed over several parts of Indian region depending upon the seasons. CF is found to be moderate to higher during monsoon months with increasing trend over several parts of the country. Optically thicker high-level clouds have low SWCRF value; whereas, middle-level and low-level clouds have low to moderate SWCRF value. In the majority of cases, Twomey effect is observed whereas in some scenarios Anti-Twomey effect is seen.

TI  - A Genealogy of Animal Diseases and Social Anthropology (1870-2000)
T2  - MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Culling, vaccinating, and monitoring animals are the three main techniques used in contemporary veterinary public health to manage animal diseases that can be transmitted to humans. Each technique is underpinned by different ontological understandings of how microbes figure in relations between humans and animals. Therefore, animal diseases are not only a question for an applied anthropology but also involve the theoretical core of the discipline: that is, understanding how social causality emerges out of physical causality. To defend this argument, the article describes what Herbert Spencer wrote about foot-and-mouth disease; what William Robertson Smith thought about sacrifice in the context of bovine tuberculosis; how Emile Durkheim took vaccination for smallpox as a metaphor for the pathologies of the social; and what Claude Levi-Strauss wrote about mad cow disease. The conceptions of the social in the writing of these four authors are analyzed through their understanding of the risk of transmission of animal diseases to humans, moving from prevention to precaution to preparedness.

TI  - Aqua MODIS Electronic Crosstalk Survey: Mid-Wave Infrared Bands
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board NASA's Aqua polar-orbiting satellite has long been known to be subjected to electronic crosstalk. Its signatures are clearly visible in images of the lunar disk by various bands, which are routinely obtained during scheduled roll maneuvers. Electronic crosstalk can potentially impact Level 1B products, causing image artifacts such as striping and radiometric bias. However, a comprehensive effort in mapping the sending/receiving bands and detectors, deriving the crosstalk coefficients, and assessing the impact of the crosstalk contamination on the Level 1B product for Aqua's mid-wave IR bands (3.75 - 4.52 mu m) had been lacking. In this work, we surveyed lunar images by the Aqua MODIS bands that are connected to electronic output 2 of the SWIR/MWIR FPA, identifying all detectors affected by electronic crosstalk contamination and determined which bands and detectors are sending the contaminating signal. By assuming a linear model to describe the contamination, we derived linear crosstalk coefficients for the bands/detectors concerned from lunar images and used these to generate corrected Earth Level 1B images for the mid-wave IR bands and assessed the impact of the electronic crosstalk on the Level 1B imagery.

TI  - Uncertainty in Catchment Delineations as a Result of Digital Elevation Model Choice
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nine digital elevation model (DEM) datasets were used for separate delineations of the Nam Co, Tibet catchment and its subcatchments, and these delineated areas were compared using the highest resolution dataset, TanDEM-X 12 m, as a baseline. The mean delineated catchment area was within 0.1% percent of the baseline delineation, with a standard error of the mean (SEM) that was 0.13% of the baseline. In a comparison of 49 subcatchment areas, TanDEM-X and ALOS datasets delineated similar areas, followed closely by SRTM 30 m, then SRTM 90 m, ACE2, and ASTER GDEM1. ASTER GDEM2 was a noteworthy outlier, having the largest mean subcatchment area that was nearly three times that of the baseline mean. Correlation coefficients were calculated for subcatchment parameters, SEM, and each DEM's subcatchment area error. SEM had a weak but significant negative correlation with the mean and median slope. ASTER GDEM1 and GDEM2 were the only datasets that showed any significant correlations with the subcatchment environment variables, though these correlations were also weak. The 30 m posting ASTER GDEMs performed worse against the baseline than the other 30 m and 90 m datasets, showing that posting alone does not determine how good a dataset is. Our results show general small errors for catchment delineations, though there is the possibility for large errors, particularly in the older ASTER and SRTM datasets.

TI  - Estimating Biomass and Yield Using METRIC Evapotranspiration and Simple Growth Algorithms
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop models are used to assess crop yield under prescribed scenarios and at scales varying from point to field to region and beyond. The use of models to evaluate the performance of agricultural systems, as they exist in the real world, can be challenging and plagued with constraints. This is due to the difficulty in characterizing the spatial variability across the landscape of crops, soils, weather, management, miscellaneous stress factors, and the initial state of the system. We propose the use of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimated from remote sensing images and simple crop growth-transpiration algorithms as an alternative to the use of standalone crop models for real-world yield assessment. In this study, we combined ETa estimates from METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration) with simple crop growth algorithms extracted from the CropSyst model to estimate biomass production and yield at high resolution (30 by 30 m). We tested this approach in four dryland agriculture sites in eastern Washington State with contrasting annual precipitation. All sites were equipped with an eddy covariance flux tower for ground ETa estimation. The proposed approach was able to provide good estimates of ETa, seasonal change of aboveground biomass and yields at all sites when compared with observations for a 3-year period, collectively including five different annual crops. Because estimations are made at high resolution, they can be scaled up to field or regional scales. Advantages and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed.

TI  - A Modeling Framework for Deriving Daily Time Series of Evapotranspiration Maps Using a Surface Energy Balance Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface energy balance models have been one of the most widely used approaches to estimate spatially distributed evapotranspiration (ET) at varying landscape scales. However, more research is required to develop and test an operational framework that can address all challenges related to processing and gap filling of non-continuous satellite data to generate time series of ET at regional scale. In this study, an automated modeling framework was developed to construct daily time series of ET maps using MODIS imagery and the Surface Energy Balance System model. The ET estimates generated from this modeling framework were validated against observations of three eddy-covariance towers in Oklahoma, United States during a two-year period at each site. The modeling framework overestimated ET but captured its spatial and temporal variability. The overall performance was good with mean bias errors less than 30 W m(-2) and root mean square errors less than 50 W m(-2). The model was then applied for a 14-year period (2001-2014) to study ET variations across Oklahoma. The statewide annual ET varied from 841 to 1100 mm yr(-1), with an average of 994 mm yr(-1). The results were also analyzed to estimate the ratio of estimated ET to reference ET, which is an indicator of water scarcity. The potential applications and challenges of the ET modeling framework are discussed and the future direction for the improvement and development of similar automated approaches are highlighted.

TI  - Quality improvement in melanoma care: Multidisciplinary quality program development and comparison of care before and after implementation
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Adherence to guideline-based care for melanoma remains suboptimal. This study describes the development of a quality monitoring program and compares the quality of care before and after its implementation.Methods: Thirty quality metrics were adopted. An abstraction tool, manual and electronic database were developed. Metrics were analyzed from 1/1/2008-8/31/2013 (Group A) and compared to melanoma care from 9/1/2013-12/31/2017 (Group B).Results: A total of 311 patients were treated from 2008 to 2017. Demographic data were similar between the groups.21.7% of patients in Group A had clinical stage (TNM) documented before surgery compared to 100% in Group B. 86.9% of patients in Group A had surgical margins documented in the operative report compared to 100% of Group B. Appropriate surgical margins were obtained in 85.7% of Group A compared to 99.5% in Group B. Pathology reporting of margin status, satellitosis, regression and mitotic rates improved from similar to 60% Group A to 92% in Group B. Multidisciplinary process and structural metrics were unchanged.Conclusions: A comprehensive melanoma quality program has produced significantly improved guideline-based multidisciplinary care.

TI  - Alternating Decision Trees for Cloud Masking in MODIS and VIIRS NASA Sea Surface Temperature Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification and exclusion of clouds from satellite-based infrared fields is critical to achieve accurate retrievals of sea surface temperature (SST). Historically, identification of clouds has been driven primarily by a few uniformity tests involving a small number of pixels, brightness temperature range tests, and comparisons to low-resolution gap-free reference fields. Collectively these tests are adequate at identifying large, upper-level, very cold cumulus clouds, and uniformity tests identify moderately sized patchy cumulus clouds. But the efficacy of cloud identification often decreases at cloud edges, for small or thin cirrus clouds, and for the lower, more uniform stratus clouds, for which cloud-top temperature can be comparable to that of the sea surface, particularly at high latitudes. The heavy reliance on stringent uniformity thresholds often also has the unintended consequence of eliminating strong SST frontal regions from the pool of best-quality retrievals. This paper presents results for an ensemble cloud classifier based on a machine-learning approach, boosted alternating decision trees (ADtrees), applied to NASA MODIS and VIIRS SST imagery. The ADtree algorithm relies on the use of a majority vote from a collection of both "weak" and "strong" classifiers. This approach offers the potential to identify more cloud types and improve the retention of SST gradients in best-quality SST retrievals and also provides a per pixel confidence estimate in the classification.

TI  - Evolution of sinkholes over Wink, Texas, observed by high-resolution optical, and SAR imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Two caprock and cover collapse sinkholes, Wink Sinks #1 and #2, in Winkler County, Texas, collapsed in 1980 and 2002, respectively. They are located in a region underlain by the Salado Formation on the eastern edge of the Delaware Basin. The sinkhole collapses were associated with intense hydrocarbon drilling and production activities in the Hendrick oilfield. Production records and prior investigations imply the sinkholes developed after salt dissolution due to freshwater intrusion, cavity formation, roof failure, and successive upward cavity migration. High-resolution (1 m) aerial photography shows the ensuing expansion of Wink Sink #2 from 2002 through 2010 and relative stability of the ground surface after 2010. Very high-resolution (25 cm) staring spotlight mode TerraSAR-X reveals the spatiotemporal details of Wink sinkhole deformations. The vicinities around the two existing sinkholes (Wink Sinks #1, #2) deformed at a rate of 5 cm/yr in line-of-sight (LOS) direction from October 2015 to March 2016, and the deformation was possibly caused by the gradual deposit of the debris from overlying unconsolidated Alluvium and Santa Rosa sandstones infilling the cavity after the sinkhole collapse. Specifically, the largest deformation of 53 cm/yr in LOS direction was found 1 km east of Wink Sink #2. Our study suggests that severe drought in 2011 widened and created fractures as well as ground fissures in the rocks overlying and underlying the salt formation due to the increased effective stress. Fractures, ground fissures, and the abandoned unplugged boreholes or improperly completed wells opened one or more vertical pathways of freshwater from groundwater flow and precipitation toward the salt bed, finally causing the rapid salt dissolution and the opening of new cavities. To explain the onset of a rapid subsidence near the Wink sinkholes, our study considers the combined effect of natural perturbation (i.e., drought, rock fractures, ground fissures, subsurface drainage, precipitation) and anthropogenic effects (i.e., improper well control). Our method to explore high-resolution imagery can be applied to characterize the sinkhole deformation and mitigate sinkhole-related geohazards.

For ovarian cancer, cost-effectiveness of genetic testing to prevent cancer, use of analgesics and oral pill to reduce cancer risk, efficacy of secondary cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, update in the use of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, and efficacy of anti-angiogenic targeted treatments, including bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, were reviewed. For corpus cancer, sentinel lymph node mapping technique, adjuvant therapy in high-risk endometrial cancer (PORTEC-3), and targeted therapy in recurrent disease were covered. For the field of radiation oncology, survival outcomes of chemoradiation compared with chemotherapy alone in metastatic cervical cancer and new findings regarding the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer were introduced. Lastly, for breast cancer, the use of talazoparib in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutation, ovarian suppression for premenopausal patients, adjuvant chemotherapy guided by 21-gene assay, and combination therapy of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel for triple-negative cancer as well as promising overall survival results of palbociclib and fulvestrant in advanced breast cancer were briefly mentioned.

TI  - Gene expression profiling in melanoma: past results and future potential
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The field of melanoma oncology is rapidly evolving with advances in detection, staging and treatment. There is heterogeneity in all stages of melanoma where some patients fare better than others for reasons currently unknown and it is sometimes unclear which patients warrant closer surveillance, multidisciplinary care, increased imaging, more aggressive surgery or adjuvant therapy. Early studies have shown the predictive ability of gene expression profiling (GEP) and institutions that have adopted GEP for melanoma treatment have demonstrated changes in practice patterns and patient management. The goal of this paper is to review the clinical evidence for a new diagnostic test, DecisionDx-Melanoma, the only GEP test for cutaneous melanoma with prospective studies analyzing its utility.

TI  - Distinct Antibody Signatures Associated with Different Malaria Transmission Intensities in Zambia and Zimbabwe
T2  - MSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum are specific biomarkers that can be used to monitor parasite exposure over broader time frames than microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests, or molecular assays. Consequently, seroprevalence surveys can assist with monitoring the impact of malaria control interventions, particularly in the final stages of elimination, when parasite incidence is low. The protein array format to measure antibodies to diverse P. falciparum antigens requires only small sample volumes and is high throughput, permitting the monitoring of malaria transmission on large spatial and temporal scales. We expanded the use of a protein microarray to assess malaria transmission in settings beyond those with a low malaria incidence. Antibody responses in children and adults were profiled, using a P. falciparum protein microarray, through community-based surveys in three areas in Zambia and Zimbabwe at different stages of malaria control and elimination. These three epidemiological settings had distinct serological profiles reflective of their malaria transmission histories. While there was little correlation between transmission intensity and antibody signals (magnitude or breadth) in adults, there was a clear correlation in children younger than 5 years of age. Antibodies in adults appeared to be durable even in the absence of significant recent transmission, whereas antibodies in children provided a more accurate picture of recent levels of transmission intensity. Seroprevalence studies in children could provide a valuable marker of progress toward malaria elimination.IMPORTANCE As malaria approaches elimination in many areas of the world, monitoring the effect of control measures becomes more important but challenging. Low-level infections may go undetected by conventional tests that depend on parasitemia, particularly in immune individuals, who typically show no symptoms of malaria. In contrast, antibodies persist after parasitemia and may provide a more accurate picture of recent exposure. Only a few parasite antigens-mainly vaccine candidates-have been evaluated in seroepidemiological studies. We examined antibody responses to 500 different malaria proteins in blood samples collected through community-based surveillance from areas with low, medium, and high malaria transmission intensities. The breadth of the antibody responses in adults was broad in all three settings and was a poor correlate of recent exposure. In contrast, children represented a better sentinel population for monitoring recent malaria transmission. These data will help inform the use of multiplex serology for malaria surveillance.

TI  - Comparison between single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography and planar scintigraphy in sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer patients
T2  - ANNALS OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveRadio-guided sentinel node (SN) biopsy is a standard method used in the treatment of early breast cancer. Single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) has been commonly used for SN detection. SPECT/CT adds precise anatomical information of SN sites, and it is reported that more SNs may be detectable on SPECT/CT than on planar imaging. We here investigate which breast cancer patients have benefited from SPECT/CT over planar imaging.MethodsA total of 273 breast cancer patients including 80 with ipsilateral breast tumor relapse (IBTR) underwent both multiple-view planar imaging and SPECT/CT for SN detection. The number of SNs, the patients who had benefitted from SPECT/CT, and the SN procedure failure rate were compared between SPECT/CT and planar imaging. Factors influencing the visualization of para-sternal and ipsilateral level II, III nodes, and contralateral axillary nodes were also analyzed using logistic regression analysis.ResultsThe number of hot spots did not differ between SPECT/CT and multiple-view planar imaging. Eight contaminated patients and 52 patients with visualized extra-level I axillary nodes benefited from identifying precise anatomical sites. Even though radioactive nodes could be harvested in most (192/193) of the non-IBTR patients (7/8 in non-SN visible patients), no radioactive nodes could be found during surgery in 11 of 80 IBTR patients. Axillary surgery (dissection) increased the visualization of para-sternal and level II, III axillary nodes, and previous irradiation increased the visualization of contralateral axillary nodes.ConclusionMultiple-view planar imaging was equivalent to SPECT/CT for depicting hot nodes for radio-guided SN detection in breast cancer. SPECT/CT was useful when precise anatomical information was necessary, especially regarding sentinel lymph nodes other than ipsilateral axilla. Logistic regression analysis revealed that axillary surgery (dissection) increased the visualization of para-sternal and level II, III axillary nodes, and the only relevant factor influencing visualization of contralateral axillary SNs was previous radiation to the breast.

TI  - Pedagogical strategy for teaching and learning Epidemiology in Nursing undergraduate school
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENFERMAGEM
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: to implement a pedagogical strategy in the epidemiology course of a nursing school in a public university. Method: This is an interventional prospective study, with a critical epidemiological approach, based on the learner's worldview for a theoretical conception about science. The development of the study started from a field recognition for the systematization of the teaching-learning strategy and ended with the evaluation of the course. Results: 67 students participated in the study, 91% were female and 54% were between 20 and 29 years old. Prior knowledge was mostly clinical/biological, and the strategy used enhanced the knowledge of science in a critical, creative and reflective way, stimulating intersectionality and teamwork through the use of Information and Communication Technologies. Final Consideration: The pedagogical strategy provided a meaningful learning about the principles of epidemiology.

TI  - The operational method of filling information gaps in satellite imagery using numerical models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Occurrence of cloud cover over remotely sensed area is a significant limitation in the ocean colour and infra-red remote sensing applications, especially when operational use of such a data is considered. A method for the reconstruction of missing data in remote sensing images has been propesed. lt is hased on complementing satellite data with the corresponding information from other sources of data, in our tested case it was the ecohydrodynamic model. The method solves the problem the presence of a cloud cover also during an extended period. Unlike in many other similar methods, emphasis has been put on retaining remotely sensed information to a high degree and preserving local phenomena that are usually difficult to capture by other methods than satellite remote sensing. The method has been tested on the Baltic Sea. Sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration estimated from satellite data, ecohydrodynamic models and merged product were compared with in situ data. The algorithm was optimized for the two parameters that are crucial for e.g. creating algae bloom forecasts. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the final product of sea surface temperature was 0.73 degrees C, whereas of the input satellite images 1.26 degrees C or 1.33 degrees C and of model maps 0.89 degrees C. The error factor of chlorophyll a concentration product was 1.8 mg m-3, in comparison to 2.55 mg m(-3) for satellite input source and 2.28 mg m(-3) for the model one. The results show that the proposed method well utilizes advantages of both satellite and numerical simulation data sources, at the same time reducing the errors of estimation of merged parameters compared to similar errors for both primary sources. It would be a valuable component of fuzzy logic and rule-based HABs prediction.

TI  - Exploitation of pentatomids by native egg parasitoids in the native and introduced ranges of Halyomorpha halys: a molecular approach using sentinel egg masses
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Following introduction of Halyomorpha halys in Europe and North America, a concerted effort has been made to characterize host-parasitoid interactions involving H. halys. Yet, it is unclear whether the reported low parasitism in the field is due to the rejection of H. halys by native parasitoids, or the inability of larvae to develop. To determine whether native and exotic pentatomids are equally exploited by native parasitoids in the introduced range of H. halys, sentinel stink bug (native and exotic) egg masses were exposed in different habitats and the incidence of parasitism was determined by rearing and DNA-based approaches. Parasitism estimates were always lower with rearing compared to the molecular method. Egg masses of both native and exotic host species were equally likely to be attacked under natural conditions, supporting the idea that H. halys represents an evolutionary trap for native parasitoids. Lack of parasitoid emergence from H. halys eggs is probably not due to native parasitoids rejecting this host, but rather due to the inability of larvae to complete development. The frequent parasitization of H. halys by native parasitoids highlights the possibility of interspecific interactions with natural enemies considered for introduction as part of biological control programme (e.g. Trissolcus japonicus). Oviposition in eggs of the unsuitable H. halys host by native parasitoid may also have population-level consequences for both parasitoids (e.g. reduced population size, shifts in parasitoid community composition) and pentatomids (e.g. competition with H. halys, deceased population regulation by parasitoids). These effects should be considered when developing biological control strategy for H. halys.
